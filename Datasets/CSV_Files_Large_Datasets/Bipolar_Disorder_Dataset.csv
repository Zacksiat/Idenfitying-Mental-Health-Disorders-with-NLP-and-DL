"After taking Zoloft for a week and experiencing a lot of manic symptoms, my psychiatrist deduced that I have bipolar disorder. This was after the fact that I told her about previous manic episodes and other information I provided for her, of course. Iâ€™ll be starting on seroquel 25 mg for 3 days, upping to 50 mg a night after that. My psych said that it is temporary and that I will switch to a different medication (or add a med but Iâ€™m not completely sure) soon after starting seroquel.

Itâ€™s just funny to me, because the only reason I sought out therapy and a psychiatrist was for an ADHD consultation. I was first medicated due to my extreme levels of depression and anxiety that Iâ€™ve been experiencing since I was 12/13 years old. Now it turns out that I have bipolar disorder.

Iâ€™m happy to be figuring myself out, but my god this is scarier than I thought. A lot of research ahead.",bipolar_disorder

"I am a 19M, it's actually my birthday tomorrow funnily enough...

I have gone my whole life dealing with every single symptom of BPD. It's become such a normal thing that I just never questioned it. Infact when I was younger I DID try telling my parents about it, but I was quickly dismissed for being ""dramatic"". Well the last few days I have been digging deeper into my emotions and tendencies, only to find every checkmark ticked. 

I'm not going to lie, I'm scared. What if I really am overreacting? I've told my best friend my suspicions and he has grown increasingly distant. I'm supposed to go in for a walk in appointment on Monday to be diagnosed I suppose, but I'm just really worried that I AM faking it.

Does anyone have any suggestions for me? This is my first time being open with this so I apologize if it's off-putting",bipolar_disorder
"Not sure if this will be allowed by the sub rules. If you're in Sydney, I generally go fishing in a tinny on a Sunday morning (with an aim to be getting onto the water just before dawn). Until December I had a perfect record of zero fish caught since starting again in 2020.

Easily worked out from my post history but:

* I'm male, 50 years of age
* Have bipolar2, ADHD and PTSD induced chronic depression (all now medicated and ramping up to correct levels)

I'll provide the gear (including life jackets). I can even prepare some hookless rigs if you really would rather pretend than actually try catch fish. I prefer to feed them and mostly catch and release. I'm in the Hills district and put the boat in at Apple Tree bay. 

DM me if interested. This isn't an offer to take you fishing every weekend (its my recovery time) but I'd be happy to have some company some weekends.",bipolar_disorder

I was fine (or thought I was). Anyway, this is where I get stupid and why I am now crying and basically I hate myself (No surprise) Anyway called my hook up asked for cuddles and he said no because I was ""asking for too much"".

"I got prescribed prozac for ""anxiety"" but it sent me into a super manic depressive state. So much so that I couldn't tell my dreams from reality and sort of attempted suicide but not really. I don't think I was actually gonna go through with it but I seriously had the urge to do so for the first time. My doctor said it's likely cuz I'm bipolar. But I've never had a episode of feeling elevated and like I could do anything. My mood mostly consists of feeling like shit to feeling sort of alright but still shitty. Are any of you guys like me? Oh and I was also smokin a lot of weed at the time. I'm putting the suicidal thoughts trigger cuz I don't wanna fuck someone up but this is really a general question. Thanks peeps.",bipolar_disorder

"Diagnosed bipolar earlier this year. Still figuring all this out butâ€¦.anxiety? Iâ€™ve always been an anxious person. However, I seem to be extra anxious lately. Nothing has really changed in my life except Iâ€™m working less because Iâ€™m afraid to go to work. 

I seem to be more anxious about work than Iâ€™ve ever been. I took two weeks off because Iâ€™m so anxious. Itâ€™s developing into a real fear to where my heart races just when I think about going to work the next week. Itâ€™s becomingâ€¦crippling. Im try my best to not smoke weed to chill or drink to numb. 

Every time I have a bad day at work it just makes me more afraid to go back. It just keeps building and building and it feels insurmountable. Iâ€™ve never had it this bad and I have no idea what to do. Unfortunately quitting this job is not possible for another 6 months. I wait tables and people are so mean and judgmentalâ€¦.theyâ€™re cruel, really. The job is constantly chaotic, disorienting, and extremely stressful. I just want to drink myself to death as soon as I get home. 

 What if I make a mistake again? 
What if someone gets mad at me?
What if my manager thinks my tip percentage is too low?
What if my manager thinks im the biggest idiot here and secretly hates my guts?
What if I am stupid? Everyone else can handle this..
What if they fire be because Iâ€™m so stupid?

"I was hospitalised in 2019 just after I turned 18 for an acute psychotic episode with mania and gradiouse beliefs. 

I was later diagnosed with depressive bipolar disorder and have been taking meds for nearly three years now. 

However, I have become very depressed recently. I have regular traumatic flashbacks and I am absolutely terrified of being noticed in public by people that might know who I am / what happened to me.

Anyone who has been hospitalised or has had psychosis can I have some reassurance that I'm not going mad?

"I just need to rant because my BPD2 is winning right now.

"So I've been smoking a LOT of weed lately and at first it was to help me but now I think it's adding to my disorder (bipolar 1). It's expensive and not fun anymore but I can't seem to stop. I'll even be asking myself ""why"" as I'm packing a bowl.

My aunt offered for me to cat/house sit for two weeks in Montana (I'm from Arizona) and I agreed because why not? So I'm 3 days in now with no smoking and I feel good? I'm starting to dream again and feel super social.

THAT BEING SAID I am concerned it may be the start of a manic swing however, I've been severely depressed since June. Every day of the summer was a fight. Anyway, regardless of whether it's my mind clearing up or a manic episode in my future I feel very excited to feel again.

"So I'm 20 years old and was diagnosed when I was 15 and in the hospital. I have been on different medications since I was 13 for depression and anxiety. After I had a huge manic episode that definitely almost ruined my life (thank god I was still a minor and able to make it out of my mess with no big consequences, I was then diagnosed with bipolar 1 and put on lexipro and Latuda. It worked great for a long time. The biggest downside was feeling like an emotionless robot tbh. Things that should've made me sad, didn't affect me. I was never really happy or sad or angry, just here. Once I turned 18 I was kicked out and have been bouncing from place to place since then. Most of my jobs have been through temp services and don't offer medical insurance. I haven't been on any meds for about a year and a half now. I just can't afford it at all.

"I started off the year in a psychosis and really messed up. I spent a few days lost in my head and my delusions and literally spent the days driving around, being an idiot and speeding. I drove close to 1500 miles in 4 days. Well I managed to get caught by a cop and pulled over for speeding. I was also smoking a joint at the time and got hit with a DUI. Thankfully I keep my delusions in my head and don't talk about them so they didn't know I wasn't all there so I didn't get sent to the pysch ward. They just threw me in jail for a few days before I was able to pay the bail. Now I feel like my life is ruined. I never expected this to happen to me, I normally am a safe driver and don't speed. I also don't smoke either but during this episode I thought it was okay and wouldn't mess with my head for some reason.


I have been feeling like a complete failure since this happened and feel into a depressive pit. I'm also unemployed so now I have to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a lawyer, DUI courses, and my license is suspended. This is really going to make it so much more difficult to get a job than it already has been. I guess like a lot of us, I've had trouble keeping a job and have some gaps between employment but now this? I can't see myself ever getting a decent job again. I also told the only friend I have an tried to vent to him and guess what... he now avoids me. I just want to sleep for the rest of the year.",bipolar_disorder

"It gets better, everyone.

For years I left my illness unmedicated. Destroyed relationships, phones, and of course, frying my brain like an egg with drugs and mania. Decided to get help after I destroyed the most valuable relationship in my life. A little too late.

Now I'm on meds and am generally doing better. After a whole year though I'm still making adjustments.

 I was so so so so excited to get my degree... It sent me into an episode, completely schizoaffective, but this time I was on the meds. Stabilized within a week (thank you Latuda and Abilify, sorry mom) and am feeling better again.

I finally did it. I was taken by ambulance to the hospital in February last year for something I tried doing to myself. My dads insurance paid for only a tiny part of it.

"So from what I understand there are officially two diagnostic categories for bipolar disorder which are defined quite specifically.

However while trying to understand whether or not I might have bipolar disorder I have talked to a few friends diagnosed with bipolar and a few friends who have questioned whether they might be bipolar.

From what my friends have said it often seems like it's really common not to really fit neatly into the diagnostic criteria. For example I have two friends with type two bipolar disorder who have experienced a full blown manic episode under unusual circumstances. One of them often has hypomanic episodes that only last one day. There are also edge cases where people have some bipolar traits but not enough to meet the diagnostic criteria.

I'm normally depressed but under unusual circumstances I've had a couple of 2-3 day long hypomanic episodes. It's possible that I've had more but I don't remember very well. I had psychosis (or something close to it) once years ago but no mania. I have some 'risk factors' including ADHD and a bipolar family member. It's not quite enough to get a diagnosis but I feel like it's close. Sort of like I have potential for hypomania to become a cyclic thing but it hasn't so far.

I was kind of stressing about whether or not I have bipolar disorder until I learned that it seems like it's actually pretty common to be kind of an 'edge case' with apparently [40% of Americans with major depression having had a manic or hypomanic episode](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=118977). There's also cyclothymia, [depressive episodes with short duration hypomania](https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/depressive-episodes-with-short--duration-hypomania-dsm--5), and apparently various other subtypes of bipolar.

It also seems like there may be hereditary connections between major depression, bipolar, and psychosis/schizophrenia?

I was reminded of the autistic spectrum (i.e. the range of different ways autism can manifest). Previously in the DSM autism had a few different subtypes such as Asperger's syndrome and PDD-NOS but under further study they were considered to be quite difficult to distinguish from one another and had so much overlap that they were collated into a single diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder.

I'm wondering if the concept of ""spectrum"" could be similarly applied to bipolar disorder and its related conditions. What do you think?",bipolar_disorder
"I would probably be a lot better off if I had a ""conservatorship"" in my 20s but at least I understand my illness now and I know what the rules are of staying well with bipolar (and how the illness can burn you badly if you're not following the rules).

"Hello all,

I have been in love with my friend for a while ago, about a year now, I think. We have known each other for five years and I honestly never thought he would be the one but I started to think about him all the time, and we would talk on the phone every night. A few months ago I really accepted that I love him and I want to be with him. I talked about him all the time to everyone, I wrote so many words in my diary about him and how much I love everything about him. I was thinking about him all the time and wanted to talk with him all the time. I secretly fantasized about being in a relationship with him, getting to call him my boyfriend and for him to call me his girlfriend, and doing domestic things together all the time. I did things like keep the spare pillow he used on my bed, and kept his phone charger on my wall from the time he stayed over, pretending that they were there because we were together and he lived with me. I wanted to always dress up nicely for him and shower him with gifts. I really felt feelings for him. 

One week ago I asked him to be my boyfriend. He said yes and he said he has actually liked me for a long time, since we first met. The problem is that since that day I have been feeling completely numb inside. I feel barely any love or happiness. It started when I woke up that morning. I had planned to give him flowers, I knew I should be feeling excited but I didn't feel much. I felt so worried that whole day because I didn't feel happy, but I didn't feel sad, I just felt no emotions. I started crying after the first time we kissed each other. I thought it would go away after a few days but it hasn't. I've felt nothing except numbness or anger (not related to him). I don't feel like myself at all. I feel like an alien or robot. Like I'm not even human anymore. I feel like I'm an intruder who got swapped with the ""real"" me and I have to just remember and recite what she likes, or what she would say. 

Has anyone else had an experience like this where you just suddenly shut off from your feelings? Am I just getting used to things? Am I maybe feeling shocked because of this big change in my life? Am I just having an episode? Is it my medications? I can't stop thinking about it. I'm so scared that I don't actually love him or something. I'm so scared because he loved me all this time, I finally tell him yes, I don't want to have to tell him that  it's actually a no. I couldn't live with myself. And I want to love him so bad. I just want my feelings to come back. I'm so afraid. Someone please help me.",bipolar_disorder

"So here it goes. I am 23 years old, and I have no friends.

I just started seeing a therapist 2 weeks ago. I got a new job, and I just started going back to college and I have 5 semesters left. 

I have no one to talk to except my father, mother, and two younger brothers who are 19 and 17. 

I recently noticed everyone getting annoyed by me because I talk too much and always want to share what Iâ€™m interested in. 

I even ask about them like their day, or what theyâ€™re interested in, or just try to talk about them since I have no one to talk to and they donâ€™t care. 

So today I finally snapped. No one wanted to answer my calls, no one wanted to respond to my text, and no one wanted to even just sit in the living room and watch tv with me. I even said Iâ€™ll watch what they want to watchâ€¦

So I just sent them a text and said â€œIâ€™m tired of me always hitting you guys up and none of you ever responding or even messaging me firstâ€.

So starting today Iâ€™m gonna leave them alone and stop texting or calling them.

I have been planning my Death day for my birthday for the past few years and this month I have chosen not to go through with it.

To put this into context, I have mild to moderate depression always and episodes of severe, debilitating anxiety with panic attacks. This state will sometimes stay 24/7 for a few days or weeks and then change to â€žsome hours normal if I manage to distract myself and some still very badâ€œ.

Around two months or so ago I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 and my GP put me on Seroquel with the intention of gradually reducing the Resperidone. 
I then had a manic episode and my GP put me on 500mg of lithium with bloods being at 0.38 after two weeks. 
Heâ€™s now upped my dose to 750mg.
I just saw a psychiatrist this morning and he has suggested that once my blood is in therapeutic range, to gradually come off Seroquel &amp; Resperidone.

she died in a car accident, on impact death. we are both recently 19. it's a weird situation. we weren't close, but we talked daily and about deep things but we just weren't super close. we hung out at each other's apartment and went to class and parties together. we talked last night, about school starting Monday and upcoming college parties. we were best friends in elementary, middle, high school, and college, but in the way that if we had class together and would have deep talks about our family and life and reminisce on our past growing up in a small town. we talked outside of school daily, but they were base level and most gossip talks.

I was just listening to a song today and thinking about our pregame at her apartment and listening to it while someone drove us to a party. it was the first time i really lived and did something crazy in college. she helped me live. we laughed so hard about the past and planned for craziness in the future. her life was very messy. she was a day drinker and alcoholic and ran with messy people, but it never crossed my mind that something like a car accident that wasn't her fault would kill her so soon. I'm not ready for the funeral if there is one. I'm not ready for school or work. I'm not ready to put this into prospective and maybe that's why I can't.

I don't know how to put into words what our friendship was, but it doesn't matter much now I don't think.",bipolar_disorder

"I only got my diagnosis earlier this year and it took a few months of titration with meds before I really felt balanced.

I never researched too much about bipolar (pre diagnosis) because I didnâ€™t want to fall down the rabbit hole of self diagnosis, so the last few months has been a wealth of new discovery for me (esp via this sub when someone will post about a certain aspect and I can deeply relate to it).

I also tend to make self deprecating jokes, which my whole family does as well. I hear itâ€™s an Aussie thing. 

Anyway long story long, my partner and daughter have taken to rolling their eyes in a â€here we go againâ€œ manner if I mention bipolar.

"Ive always thought i had bipolar, but everyone Ive brought it up to says its normal to have mood swings/not be happy all the time but it feels like more than that.

Most of the time Im just depressed but i remember having manic episodes more when i was in middle and high school, my parents would scold me (for being too wild)and ask if i was on drugs. I would pull all-nighters, i bought several pets i had no business owning, i would drive crazy, go on 10 mile runs, cut my own hair in the middle of the night, get into physical fights, and then crash and regret everything. Ive also lost many friends by starting fights or ignoring out of depression and ive struggled with SH since 7th grade. 

Im now 25 and just got off of Lexapro because it caused a manic episode, i asked my physiatrist about mood stabilizers but she said shes â€œnot convincedâ€ i need them and prescribed me anxiety meds that arent helping at all. And now im sad and confused. 

So i guess im askingâ€¦am i being dramatic by thinking i might have bipolar? I feel almost embarrassed to bring it up with my doctor again because theyâ€™ll probably say its normal or not enough evidence.

"Hi,

I also am an aspie, so please don't think I'm being obtuse in understanding this social situation!

Basically, became massively infatuated with someone, which triggered both a mixed episode and my psych deciding to concurrently diagnose me with BPD. (He knows I have bipolar as he witnessed the mixed episode and knows about an OD I took lately. )

I asked him why he'd been so distanced, and he said something about us being in different places, and, when pressed, that, since he heard I had feelings for him and am a colleague in a vulnerable position, he'd taken a step back.

I understand he is not interested in me romantically. But does his response mean there is zero attraction? A part of me hopes he doesn't think I'm disgustingly ugly, but believes it's inappropriate for the reasons he mentioned. I understand you're not mind readers, but I can't ask him for clarification, so was please hoping for some answers?

Thank you!",bipolar_disorder

I got myself in a bad situation which could've been much worse and it was all due to mania from lack of sleep and food and starting from routine.

"**Background**: Eight months ago, I was involuntarily hospitalized with grandiose manic delusions. I thought I was both Jesus and Batman, and wanted to marry my car. 

Despite no desire to self-harm or intention to harm others, the way I was driving was enough to declare me a danger...

So I joined the grippy sock club and was discharged with a script for 1200mg Lithium. 

I'm stable now. But stable is a misleading word. There's so many things I wish I could do but find myself unable to start. I *hate* that people like us are overrepresented in jails, in drug rehab, and where even *stable* means being loaded up on expensive meds.


**Today**:
I want my first episode to be my only. But for this to happen for me, I need to understand *how* I became deluded. And to that end, 
I've reactivated my 3 old Twitter handles from the depths of my psychosis, and what I will say is they are uneasy friends at best. 

While I, and I need to *emphasize* now, I am medicated and stable, with a psychiatrist and therapist and strong friends and family to fall back on... I have already been able to produce psychotic features of my own volition. I'm learning to understand the same experiences as symptoms instead of external ""signs"" that drove my delusions. 


I'm excited to do this self-exploration and to be documenting it all to the best of my ability online. 

If any of this is of interest to you, you can certainly follow along. You'd probably want to start with [The Austonian](https://twitter.com/AustonianC),  they're the most meta of the bunch, and they do still contain my old scribblings as a bonus, if you scroll far enough.

I told him about an ideation i was having of hurting someone else. He tried to say "" you dont wanna think like that, is this person that bad? Im sure they're an ok person""

What? That's why I'm here today, because i dont want to get in trouble, or make another manic decision that i need to pick the pieces up afterwards.

So what did i do? I punched the handsanitizer thing, broke it. I feel horrible. I just stormed out of the hospital, and tried to chill. But i couldn't. So i went home.

It's not other people's responsibility to make sure im acting in healthy ways. This is not me, and when im manic, im easily triggered. I feel bad. This is my illness, and i hate that it effects others so much. I feel really trapped.

"I guess I'm seeking advice or would like to hear what has worked for people regarding this. As someone with bipolar I have a unique dependency with aspects of my routine and oftentimes an extreme sensitivity to stress. After years of stability, honestly, I am entirely convinced that it is 100% impossible for ""normal"" people to wrap their head around this. There is often a certain rigidity that I need to hold over certain things such as meals, meditation practice, down time, time to get things done, lights out time... and to someone without bipolar disorder that tends to sound absolutely preposterous.

With my family I can just walk away, seek my own space, and do my own thing. But with a significant other there is an aspect of emotion and sharing of space that is not a part of all my other relationships. There is pressure to meet certain emotional needs and this pressure to just ""loosen up a little bit"" at times. Like I don't have enough of a hard time already! I often WANT to abandon my routine and do whatever I want whenever I want; I want to blow things off and procrastinate and cast aspects of routine aside for that sake. It's hard to be healthy.

My significant other is wonderful and we have a very healthy relationship, but of course there are times that she doesn't realize how much of a ""distraction"" she can be or when there is that pressure to cater to emotion. When I communicate that, of course there are times that she may take it personally. Sometimes she is unaware when she pushes me to loosen up a bit, and sometimes I do. That's on me, not on her. Of course that comes with consequences, and when she sees that she recognizes it and learns how to support and meet my needs better in that regard.

Overall, she is a very receptive and wonderful partner. I couldn't ask for anything more from her. She does her part and is always striving for growth in playing that role just a little bit better. I commit to doing the same on my end. We strive for that together, and I take pride in that.

I've got a car but it needs ~$1000 in repairs, meaning I can't really work atm since Ubering would be crazy expensive and there are no buses that run through our town. I have no family to turn to and have fallen out of touch with most of my friends. I stay home all day doing the same thing every day. Look for jobs -&gt; clean the house -&gt; prepare food for my gf and I. I'm going crazy being stuck home all day for a year, crippled with stress and anxiety for not being able to make money and contribute to our expenses. 

A year ago my mental health was doing well but now i don't even recognize myself anymore. Life truly sucks and my girlfriend is the only one keeping me going.",bipolar_disorder

Recently Iâ€™ve been off meds 1 monthish and I feel my health is deteriorating. I am always sleepy with no energy. I can't wake up and I'm getting dizzy most of the time. I cannot work at all due to the low energy and sleepiness. I haven't showered in days. I know these signs are leading to depression. How do I cope with this. I gained 20kg due to this and I feel like I'm losing my mind.

"Hi, just have a couple of questions to help me understand bipolar better.

Is (hypo)mania:

1. triggered by an event (e.g. a trauma trigger) or does it just come out of the blue?

2. while I understand hypomania needs to last four days or more for diagnosis purposes, can someone with bipolar have shorter periods of hypomania such as just one or two days?",bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™ve  recently been diagnosed with bipolar, but I started seeing my psychiatrist in March. Iâ€™m currently in a manic episode which is the first sheâ€™s seen. She upped my Lithium to 1200 and my Olanzapine to 5mg but Iâ€™m stillon 20mg fluoxetine.

Im feeling an ultimate high, depression and anxiety at the same time. 

At this time my rational side is holding back my impulsivity and god complex. Iâ€™m one bad day away from quitting my job and starting an onlyfans and streaming. 

Why? I donâ€™t know!! I got god complex in my head right now telling me itâ€™ll work out and just do it. But I know itâ€™s just me trying to find an escape from the mundaness of life. But manic part of me is like â€œcome oooon ðŸ˜ letâ€™s do itâ€

"I don't want to go through it again. But I do. Things go flat and for too long. Each day is the same. There are good things that happen most every one but it's still the same day over and over. Wake up and take a quick assesment.....nope not feeling any bit the other direction so be satisfied with that. Prop up and watch the sky get brighter soon it will be completely light out and you'll have to head back into the same day. Try to imagine a life that could be different, to where you don't recognize the redundancy. Pretty sure I always will. Robotic thing. 

For a while it was very real and I thought He would help. Plenty of doubts along the way, having not believed all those years before, but you believed He might help. Not so sure anymore, about any of this. It's faded away so much, that the Creator is the One. I Am Who I Am, so am I, and who I am is just another robot in a redundant life. Was hoping You could help with that. But I'm not so sure anymore. 

I want it to come back, now two things. That strong belief plus those days where I was a part of life. More than a part, set apart. Each day was different and certainly not redundant, but the last time it happened it was the best so far. Is my mind matured to handle the ride now? The last time was so very different. Some moments of grandeur but...just part of something bigger as the redundant pattern that everyone else was in was set apart from me. Crisp, but not chaotic. 

But it never lasts. Back to reality. Back to the pattern. Robotic existence and now He's becoming not-so-real. It's been two summers since my last ride. Wouldn't mind if it came back but I can't say what it will be like. Wasn't working those two summers ago so I could fold into whatever I wanted to. If it came back now I'd probably quit and think everything would work out. Usually doesn't. Been a year and a half since He became real, now that's fading away. Back to just being alive. 

Life could be much worse and I know this. It's been 15 years since my first ride. The next four were pretty crazy, most recent was the best, two summers ago. A dark winter of sorts followed. Not depressed, just lost. Existential stuff, dark night of the soul. Then He showed up in my bedroom one night. A sensation, presence, like I've never experienced before. And haven't since. Been a year and a half since that night and a lot of diving in. But it's faded away and I'm back to watching the sky get bright. Not sure what's real except that the bills need paid that way I can wake up to the same day over and over. Not thinking it will ever be any different at this point. Just here.",bipolar_disorder

"Well that was pretty stupid. Or was it? 

Close call, in a way, not in an arrogant way in saying that, or my beliefs are correct and you're wrong, but my journey into belief almost came to a complete stop. Came at the hands of spending time on one of those Christian subreddit things. Open discussion for all things Christianity related so athiests and agnostics and theists and Satanists and seventh day Adventists and Jehovahs witnesses and....anyone was welcome to post something or comment. Wasn't very civil at times either. A lot of the time. 

I guess it was bound to happen, come across information that denounces Christ and the existence of God. Obviously not something that I'm unaware of, people don't believe Jesus is who he said he was and God doesn't exist. But spending about a month and a half in that community was pretty much like snorting a line of doubt and questioning straight to my brain. No slow trickle of doubts and questioning, not a little jab here and there, just a flood of second guessing. God certainly started fading away in my mind, Christ as well, the night that brought me into belief and the strange things that have happened also quickly became nothing. Pretty stupid to do that to myself not sure why I'm such an idiot sometimes but it was bound to happen - extreme doubt. 

It had to be exponentially easier to step into the path of becoming a believer when the internet wasn't avaliable. Build your faith without a whole lot of conflicting information around. I'm actually 100% certain of that, was easier. I could've just not done that but being the Curious George that I am, went right into the lions den ""Oh Geroge, you so silly. Why did you snort that line of doubt and questioning?"" I dunno. Seemed like the intelligent thing to do. But perhaps the hardest stuff to read was from the ex-Christians. Decades of involvement within the church. If anyone would know that Christianity is a bunch of nonesense it would be those folks. Yea that sucked. Spending time in that place. That online community. 

One of the other discouraging posts I came across was that you can only hear God speak through scriptures. I'm not wanting to ever hear a voice in my head, ever, been through enough inside that place. Nice. Let's add this to my resume - I'm hearing voices inside my head. Noooo thank you. But people claim to have heard God speak to them. Some people hear God speak in other ways. And then yea others say that God only speaks through scriptures. I don't like that opinion, God only speaks through the Bible, mostly because of how I came into initial belief and also that I'm still having a hard time with the Bible. It doesn't seem like God is speaking to me, the words still seem as if man wrote them and are were not written by God, inspired writings. 

The author C.S. Lewis was quoted as saying something along the lines of how he was dragged kicking and screaming into the Kingdom of God. And it came to be that he didn't want to believe, but found himself later that he did. Pretty much where I'm at. If I come to fully believe that Jesus was the Son of God it won't be from brainwashing. I'm fighting this tooth and nail. 

A very high percentage of this adventure hasn't been fun. I'm envious of people who came to belief and pretty much overnight thier lives were enriched. Hasn't been the case for me. But I guess everyone's brain and walk is different and perhaps there's a reason everything has played out this way. Almost Curious George'd my way out of belief. Fun times.",bipolar_disorder

"Saw my [regular] doctor today and was advised to start regularly taking an over-the-counter allergy med such as Claritin or Zyrtec. Everything I already take is in my file (accurately, too, as the nurse who did my vitals updated them for me), so I'm assuming they wouldn't have recommended I take something that would negatively interact with my psych meds. Didn't occur to me to ask before I left, and I tried to search on my own, but couldn't come up with definitive answers.

I sent a message to my psychiatrist asking about possible interactions, but I'm not sure when I'll hear back from them &amp; I'd like to pick up meds as soon as possible because the allergies are, quite frankly, making me fucking miserable/affecting my ability to function.

"So my friend gave me a bunch of organic weed from our friends moms garden. Historically, smoking pot for me is a disaster- it makes me super manic and then I crash hard. I've also tried the whole CDB thing for anxiety with no real luck. 

This strain of pot (alien og) has been like a miracle for me. I smoke it when I'm feeling anxious/obsessive (slightly hypomanic at times) and when I am depressed.  I've been taking BP meds for close to 20 years and haven't experienced any medication giving a similar effect. It's almost like it shuts off a part of my mind thats constantly racing in the background. I can also still work and function. I feel the most calm in my life.

I've been taking like 1-2 small hits almost everyday for 2 months and still no problems. My thinking is it is leveling out my mood states to some degree. But it could be a ticking time bomb of disaster and wont tell my psychiatrist bc he will says bad idea.

Anyone else have a similar experience with weed? What strain? 

***Note I have literally spent decades perfecting my meds. Before the weed I was the most stable i have ever been on meds. I take Lamictal, Seroquel, Gabapentine, Wellbutrin and Vyvanse (damn thats depressing). I in no way encourage anyone to start smoking pot if you aren't first stable on your meds. Even then do it with caution. I am still on 100% of my meds in addition to the weed. I also have smoked pot on and off for years and have never had such an experience.

Usually I feel pretty irritable the next day, but my mood was actually quite a bit better and I was the most productive if been in months.

"So I am fully aware this is a phase of my cycling and that the anger, while at times warranted, is blown out of proportion by the bipolar. That just ticks me off more. I feel like Iâ€™m never actually allowed to be mad because either itâ€™s a part of the cycle or Iâ€™m making too big of a deal out if it in terms of reaction. But I am mad and I have good reason to be madâ€¦I think anyways. My 8y/o gets up for school and typically wakes me up (I am on disability and have a sleep disorder) I donâ€™t always get up the first or even second time unfortunately.

Called my Dr and she told me to up my dose and those side effects should disappear. I took that 3mg dose around 5 hours ago and I am already feeling uncomfortable and jittery again.

"I donâ€™t even know what I am feeling anymore. Last night I went to sleep trying to ignore the creepy crawly feeling under my skin. I havenâ€™t been sleeping well. Monday didnâ€™t sleep till 7:30amâ€¦..up all night. Worked all weekend. Pulled a 45 hour shift in 3 days. Sick with a respiratory infection. Canâ€™t breathe. Canâ€™t sleep. Canâ€™t stop thinking. Nonstop thinking. Itâ€™s all over the map.
Strange, my whole life Iâ€™ve had cycles like this. I never had a name for it though. Now, there are so many diagnoses on my chart I feel like a textbook. 
I tend to have a large reaction even to minor events or incidences. My anxiety is an instigator that feeds my depressive episodes. And my mania makes my anxiety worse because then Iâ€™m left thinking â€œwhat the hell am I doing? How far will we go this time? Where will we book a trip to? How much of my money will I blow on crystals? Am I going to buy  another car? How are we supposed to bounce back from this?â€ 
Honestly, I can handle the mania. Mixed episodes I cannot. That feeling of laughing so hard but really you were crying the whole time as well. The extreme joy but incredibly dark blue as well. The needing to jump. Literally I just get up and shake a while because itâ€™s so much. 
I recently found out summer can trigger maniaâ€¦..interesting. It was always my favorite season. The heat, the water, the smell, the salt, the sweat. Also, summer was when I sleep the least. When Fall shows up, it brings such a sense of relief. Like, yes, now I can sleepâ€¦â€¦.

"Skip to last paragraph if you don't want to read backstoryðŸŒ¸

Hi all, I'm looking for tips on how to feel full and satisfied after eating a meal. These days I have a terrible habit of binging and most of tbe time purging after because I feel so guilty. I have always struggled with my body image, especially because growing up I had multiple family members always telling me to watch what I eat and telling me that my portion sizes would make me the size of a house, or that I would end up like my mom, who is a little overweight (yes they really would tell me that). 

At the time I didn't understand but in hindsight my portion sizes were not excessive and I had pleasure from food. But all of these nasty comments in combination with social media and societal standards deeply warped my perception of myself and food itself.

Eventually I found myself in love with the gym in highschool and ate very healthy a majority of the time and would still indulge in treats. My relationship with myself and food was finally reaching a healthy place, until circumstances pulled me away from the gym. It was heart wrenching to be away from what was my escape from the world and my problems.

This, in addition to being in abusive relationships, led me down a dark path of food restriction. For an entire year I would limit myself to about 500 calories a day and nonstop caffiene, and would be fine eating a lollipop as a meal. It became almost impossible to even finish a breakfast biscuit from McDonald's because I would get so full. This continued on into college with a slight progression of eating more. I tried to get back into the gym but was very discouraged because I had been out for so long it felt like starting at square one again. I was on and off with going to the gym as covid kept opening and shutting down the gym.

I eventually found myself out of two abusive relationships and hitting the gym more often. I was tolerant of myself and even made the decision to finally get help for my mental health which I've struggled with all my life.

However, once I started psych meds that all went through the window. I did okay for awhile but at one point I just absolutely spiraled and lost myself. All I did was smoke weed and feel sorry for myself because my life felt such a mess. I eventually put myself in a treatment facility and ""graduated"" with the self help tools I needed.

But along the way, my relationship with food was obliterated. In combination with my psych meds *which are notorious for crazy weight gain* and now an insatiable desire to eat, and eat, and eat (probably to make myself feel better) I've gained at least 40 lbs in the span of 6 months. 

So now I feel even worse because I feel like I look like a bowling ball and my clothes are very hard to fit into. To make matters worse, people are commenting on my weight. Which we all know is a big NO NO. Even my Nana told me ""you should stop eating or you're gonna get EVEN fatter' I've been trying so hard to hold myself together because I literally hate myself and it seems like everyone else does to. I have never felt more ugly and unsatisfied with myself.

So all in all, I know it's going to be hard to lose the weight I gained due to psych meds, WHILE on psych meds. But I need a healthy way to lose the weight without purging. First step is to stop binging so I don't have to purge. 

Therfore, does anyone have any tips on how to feel full and satisfied with the amount and type of food I'm eating???          I don't want to binge and purge, but I don't want to put myself back into the cycle of not eating at all.

Any help is greatly appreciated! ðŸ¤ðŸ¤ðŸ¤",bipolar_disorder

For the record, I'm not against it, I think they're beautiful, I just don't want one for myself (unless I'm manic)!

But seeing everybody's tattoos on here lately I've been starting to think about maybe going for it. I've designed something different from anybody else's, but it does represent my mental illness vs being purely an artistic thing, and it would be teensy tiny and maybe in a place that would usually be covered up by clothing. It's the first time I've thought about getting a tattoo that meant something other than 'this is cool and pretty to look at.'

On the other hand, I did spend like $500 in one day a couple days ago (some was for work though), messaged literally all my friends to ask if they wanted to hang out, decided to go to Panama (in November, not hopping on a plane right this minute), have been sleeping slightly less, and I've been pretty excited lately, so I'm kind of worried I might be ramping up. 

So my question is: does anybody have any tattoo advice for when you're not sure about it? I definitely plan to wait it out if possible and see if I still want it when I'm positive I'm not Up, but I'm nervous I'll just do it impulsively if I don't have some kind of plan in place for this decision-making process (and I live within walking distance of a tattoo parlor so it's a real possibility).

I think they notice the little shit but then when I boil over I shock everyone and everyone tells me how they didnâ€™t think I was doing that bad, even my therapist and psychiatrist. The only one who really sees it is my partner, whoâ€™s been so supportive and Iâ€™m incredibly lucky to have him.

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore because I feel like Iâ€™ve lost my whole life now that Iâ€™m not working full time. My partner and I are both so worried about me, but now weâ€™re really worried about money. Luckily Iâ€™m able to work part time still but Iâ€™m just so embarrassed that I feel like I let the company down.

Anyone else having to come to terms with their limits? I feel like Iâ€™ve been pushing myself too far and I need to accept that a 9-5 isnâ€™t for me. How do you cope with feeling like a failure?",bipolar_disorder
"Normally my past lows and suicide attempts have been extremely impulsive because of how painful everything was.
This time it's different. I'm done. I'm over it. I'm happy with what I've done so far in my life and I can live with that. There's nothing left for me to give and I just want peace now.
Why is it though that I have to stick around for everyone else? Why don't I get to make that choice?
No one else knows what it's like to constantly change meds, new side effects, extended periods of time off work, financial instability, feeling like your brain is slowly melting away, all the while trying to simply stay alive.

"Well this is what my days been like. My husband finally got to call me from prison this morning after first being put in there a week and a half ago.

I asked him how his meds were going because his also bipolar and he straight up said I havenâ€™t had any seroquel because they donâ€™t allow it here theyâ€™ve just been giving me my antidepressant 3 times a day. 

Iâ€™m thinking what the actual fuck? He said he hasnâ€™t slept the whole week and sounded rapid and sketchy. So then his sister gets me on the phone after I spoke to him and I said he hasnâ€™t been taken meds she then asked yeah well apart from sounding sketchy is he okay? And I said I guess he said he was bored?
Then she said thatâ€™s good! 
So that kind of put me off 

Then the more I thought about it through out the day the more it was fucking with my head. Anyway I told his mum then she really freaked me out so I called thhe prison. And they basically said we canâ€™t have a mental health professional approach him he needs to approach them for help. And Iâ€™m saying if heâ€™s hypermanic heâ€™s probably on cloud 9 and wonâ€™t ask for help. Then they said thereâ€™s people watching him so theyâ€™ll jump in if they need to. Like what?

So then I called mine and his psychologist whoâ€™s seen a couple of times and pretty well start blurting out whatâ€™s going on with the his meds and she straight up says hold up, you guys arenâ€™t living together anymore? Whatâ€™s going on? Then I asked her if sheâ€™d spoken to my husbands solicitor and she said no. Where as his sister told me said psychologist was pissed off because weâ€™d been drinking when we got arrested. 

So yep, here the fuck I am second day quitting smoking, 4th day quitting smoking thinking what the absolute fuck.

The advice Iâ€™ve been given is when I speak to him convince him to ask to see a psychologist. So hopefully he doesnâ€™t smash someoneâ€™s head in over night or lose his absolute shit and end up in a mental unit tripping the fuck out.",bipolar_disorder

At this stage the toddler is constantly running around the apartment, very loud, has meltdowns multiple times a day, and he doesnâ€™t have a grasp of personal space yet. 

All of these things are totally fine for them, but I am finding my anxiety/stress getting triggered quite heavily whenever he is with us.

Would it be ok to tell my partner that sometimes when his son it here I just need to take some extra quiet time to myself? I think itâ€™s just the phase that my bipolar is in right now, but maybe if I were able to take some breaks and have some quiet time on the evenings he is here then I can feel more peaceful about it?

"I showed symptoms of bipolar since 4th grade and my normal growing up were having spurts of random high energy, not being able to sleep, excessively talking, grandiose thoughts, and also suffering from mild depression at times. My mood symptoms weren't severe as a kid but they definitely rose eyebrows from my teachers and other people.

Now that I'm on medication, I don't get these mood swings anymore but I can't help but feel like the meds are making me depressed... okay, maybe depressed is not the right term but more disconnected in a sense. I don't feel like I can connect with people the same way. To be honest, I think I relied a lot on my hypomanic energy as a kid to make friends. But now that I don't have that energy anymore I don't have that much of a drive to connect with people. 

The thing that fucks with me is social media. I see people chatting with each other or posting pictures of their friends and I wonder why am I not like that. Maybe I'm not normal? I don't have much friends at all. I wish I had more but at the same time that means I'll have more responsibilities and more friends = more drama. But I always feel a sense of loneliness and I don't know why... but I also don't have the desire to make friends so idk what I even want.

I'm not sure where this loneliness is coming from. Maybe it's from an excessive use of social media and not really connecting with others in the real world. Also, I was in my house for the large majority of time since covid, and my community college was online for 2 years. I also struggle with social anxiety so maybe that and being home stuck has been exacerbating my loneliness. 

Anyways, I kind of accepted that being on medication doesn't mean every aspect of my life will be easier. It should be overall easier but I need to get used to things that was easy for me during my times of instability. One of them being creative and making friends.

I'm a rather good software developer, but between managing my bipolar over the last 2 hears and taking my daughter full time by myself, everything is very difficult.

She's not potty trained because of it.  She's had trama due to fights her mom and I had when she was little.  She has extreme anger issues and is horribly defiant to authority.  She's behind in school as well.  Basically, she ""appears"" to do well if you're always giving her attention and things to do.  You never stop her unless she's ready.  You always cook the food she wants, etc.

"Hi everyone,

So after a period of I guess 1-2 months feeling down I suddenly felt hyper last month. I noticed it especially the other day at work where, despite working nights (I'm a shift worker) and doing 45 minutes overtime, I found myself more active, chatty towards everyone and I said whatever went through my mind.

Fast forward to earlier where I finally slept more than 8 hours in a row. I woke up, and still am, pretty down. I ordered food as I didn't feel like cooking, watched TV and that's it. I have a few urgent things to do but I can't get myself to do them as I really lack the mental energy and feel down without any real reason: the only thing that happened was sleeping.

Did this occur to any of you? I have trouble even thinking it makes sense: the days with no sleep or where I sleep a few hours I manage to be a lot happier than this.

"Last year my diagnosis was switched from major depression/anxiety to bipolar 2, and my meds went from Effexor and epilim to just effexor, and then replacing that with Lamotrigine. Coming off the last of the Effexor was hell on wheels, and Iâ€™ve had a couple of periods where something mild has sent my anger through the roof - Iâ€™ve been blaming it on Effexor withdrawal, but I suppose it could be the lamotrigine?

My psychiatrist has now got me trialling lithium on top of the lamotrigine. Itâ€™s been almost a week, and Iâ€™m about to go for my first blood tests, so Iâ€™m not sure what my levels are. 
Having said that, this last week has been something of a nightmare. The day of my appointment I was having a really down day, but still made it through most of a day at work, made it to my appointment, managed a lot of other things I generally struggle with, so I knew I just had to get through it. I took the first lithium dose that night and since then it has been downhill, but not depressed. Iâ€™ve never really been manic manic, and even my hypomania episodes are pretty scattered, so this is really unusual. 
Two days after the first dose I was feeling what Iâ€™m guessing was a mixed state, and more â€œI want to end thisâ€ than I have in years, and worse than I remember feeling while totally unmedicated.
I got four hours sleep last night, and feel uncomfortably restless, physically irritable, like Iâ€™m full of bees, almost a panic attack state. The only other time Iâ€™ve been like this was when I spent 3 weeks on prednisone for a bad infection. I do not like this at all. 
My question is, is this part of the process? Is it normal for things to feel worse on lithium initially and then improve? Is it a coincidence Iâ€™m unfairly blaming on the lithium? Is it an indication I need to contact the dr again and maybe lithium isnâ€™t for me?
Iâ€™m not trusting my own judgements around this at the moment, I could do with outside opinions or experiences.",bipolar_disorder
"When I first started high school I was diagnosed as adhd because I couldnâ€™t â€œfocusâ€. This isnâ€™t entirely true and I donâ€™t know why my parents snd doctors were so determined to diagnose me with it. In reality I was exhausted, I skipped school multiple times because I was just so tired. I would sleep through class even if I did go. I was depressed and thatâ€™s why I couldnâ€™t focus. I resisted the stimulants until my senior year of high school and the first time I took them it blew my mind. I remember doing multitudes of homework in a day, not sleeping for more than three hours for like a month, I was absolutely off the walls. My mind was extremely sharp, my grades skyrocketed. To everyone on the outside this seemed like it was working. Now being diagnosed bipolar two years later I question if I was ever even adhd in the first place. Speaking to people who are adhd about their stimulant experience they describe it as their mind being clear for the first time ever. It was the complete opposite for me. Everything was x100 for about a month then they lost effect and I was right back where I started but worse. I would have these periods where I would think â€œwow the meds are working againâ€ then crash a month later. I chased this â€œhighâ€ my entire last year of high school. This cycle went on until I had an awful depressive episode my first year of college followed by a full blown manic episode then a diagnosis with bipolar. I just wonder if I was ever adhd. If I wasnâ€™t then thereâ€™s no doubt that taking stimulants for two years probably made things a lot worse for me. What I experienced sounds more like rapid cycling bipolar episodes due to amphetamines than me being adhd and â€œfixedâ€ by the medication. I just wish my parents and doctor wouldâ€™ve at least considered I was depressed all those years back. Iâ€™m fully convinced â€œadhd inattentiveâ€ is just another manifestation of depression and maybe even a precursor to being bipolar. Who knows.

Now I did it. I cleaned my room. I've kept it clean. Which means I'm in a better place mentally, but getting my room clean was such an endorphins rush. Hell, days where I just made progress was an endorphins rush. Now I'm sitting here and I need to feel accomplished and... Nothing.

"It's the roller-coaster ride that I never asked to be on.

The constant ups and constant downs,

yeah... it's nauseating.



At first, it was fun.

Only because I didn't realize I was on one. 



I've been on this horrible ride for years now.

Just up, down, up, down..

Never ending.



Bipolar automatically throws you on this emotional ride

tormenting you, teasing you.

Making you feel the rush from being up so high

but then making you feel on the verge of death from falling so far down.



There is no in-between.

There will never be an in-between. 



And if there is, it's pretty rare or simply put...

Short lived.



You crash and burn so fast that you never have the time to even prepare for the fall.

What really sucks is that the highs the coaster puts you on is so short lived.



It's not fair.



Another thing that sucks is that you're crashing and burning longer

never knowing when that devilish ride will bring you back up.



Bipolar will forever keep you on this ride from Hell until that biological clock runs out.

So you should probably get used to it. 



Harsh, I know...

But that's just our reality.

Our Bipolar reality.



While you're on this high from the ride,

you feel unstoppable. 

You feel confident, more than usual that is.

You're in a heightened mood.



Whether that mood is filled with being happy 

OR

that mood causes you to be overly and easily irritated.



Sadly, that's the mood I  experience.

Extreme irritability.

But mix it with a little bit of confidence, some extreme energy

and BAM! 

You tell yourself that you never want to get off this ride.



Until it crashes into the darkness of God only knows what.



Then you start saying to yourself, 

""What the Hell?""

""I was feeling so great these last few days or week(s), why is this happening to me?!""



""Oh wait...""



Yeah, I'm sure you've had these exact thoughts, if not similar.



Not to mention that once you leave that high, which we call (Hypo)mania,

you start to drown in an intense amount of guilt.

Not even realizing that during that time of being in the highs of the ride,

that you've actually hurt some people while in your own ""world"".



You start wondering what the hell you did during this time.

""Why is everyone mad at me?""

""Why can't I always remember?""



Now you spend the next few days, weeks or even months

going through the mess you've made,

trying to pick up the pieces you lost along the way and try to repair relationships.



Oh how lovely... 

Not.



It is a never ending cycle.

A pretty vicious one might I add.



Which is why Bipolar has one of the most horrible rides a person could ever be on.



And what's funny is...



We didn't ask to be on this ride,

but here we are...",bipolar_disorder

I'm currently not smoking weed and was wondering if some full spectrum CBD or CBG might be helpful in bringing me down from acute mania. I'm on lithium and risperidone, and both have pretty uncomfortable side effects. Thinking I could speed the process up. 

I know your psychiatrist will tell you not to use any cannabis. They can't legally reccomend it for fear of lawsuits and malpractice.

"This is really annoying. I find that this is my go-to coping mechanism when I am stressed. It's also one of my biggest symptoms when my bipolar is activating - ie manic symptoms or even euthymic psychotic symptoms / mixed state episodes. It's also very easily triggered by some less sedating anti psychotics like Abilify, or any medication that can induce akathisia.

At one stage I had this so bad I had the whole ""taking off clothes and putting them back on"" symptom like an old school psych patient. I was in a mixed state psychosis from benzo withdrawal but at the time I was convinced it was actually an ABI.

At the moment I'm a bit stressed about a new job coming up. My finances aren't great because my disability has been cut off as a result of intending to work full time, and I have to wait a few weeks for my first pay cheque, so I'm pacing again. New job anxiety is quite normal, as is imposter syndrome that comes with it. I know it will pass largely after I'm settled in.

So far the only things that really help with these symptoms are sedating antipsychotics like Zyprexa which I can't take with my new job cos of oversleeping. Also exercise, which I could be doing more of. Meditation too would be useful.

It would be good to get some tips and support from some fellow bipolar bears with this. It's quite annoying and is a trigger to return to substance use that I've been doing really well with for some time.

I still feel confused, remembering bits and pieces. Unable to understand some of it. Feeling very cringe. Feel like it wouldn't take much to drop right back into it.

"I've struggled with mental health since early childhood; sustained periods of immense boredom, irritability/anger mood swings, anxiety related sleep issues. 

I was diagnosed with depression and offered a prescription by psychiatrists (SSRI) a few times since age 12 which I never tried. I always felt like it was depression with a physiological/chemical cause that I couldn't control with any method of therapy. During depressive periods I always feel what I best describe as hollow tension in my head and feeling generally bad even when meditating. It seeps into my thought process no matter what I think about. I can still socialize normally, I just feel fake and don't genuinely connect.

People always told me I was smart, good looking, funny. This never inflated my ego or really rang  true to me, even if I understood what they were talking about or that they were saying those things genuinely. There were a few times in my life where I felt like everything was on track, I felt like I was socializing normally, etc. but I never really ""felt like the life of the party"" or had any passion controlling or motivating me. I don't think I ever experienced mania or hypomania. From my perspective my best periods would be described as low-average mood and energy compared to general population, and family/friends that I've asked agree with that.

I managed to put together a pretty good life for myself before COVID started. COVID made my job very stressful and I suffered my first panic attack as a result in April or May of 2020. Since then I experienced increased anxiety that mostly presented as problematic when I tried to sleep. Otherwise I think I was doing okay. I got my life back on track and was feeling normal, though the anxiety was still present and not tied to any specific thoughts as far as I could tell. I achieved a work milestone and started a serious relationship around the same time in the first half of 2021 and all of a sudden felt the start of a severe depressive episode, which eventually led to my relationship ending and losing my job in August 2021.

I started an SSRI for the first time in my life at age 26 and within about a week I had a lot of side effects, felt very strange, and started compulsively smoking cannabis (which I wasn't using at the time) to try to counteract what I was feeling. Was completely unlike the person I've been for the entirety of my life. Within 2 weeks I experienced my second and third panic attacks in my life, on back to back days, both resulting in my emergency services physician directing me to the ER to get a benzodiazepine. My physician and psychiatrist both provided me with benzodiazepines (on separate dates) and from there my journey is kind of difficult to remember. However I added an atypical antidepressant (bupropion) to the other 2. It seemed to help with mood and motivation, though I still felt depressed and not like myself. My psychiatrist agreed to me tapering off the SSRI and suggested adding another atypical antidepressant (Mirtazapine) at the same time. Within a week or two I had a severe acute manic episode which was short lived because I was hospitalized and medicated for it. They took me off all of my medication except the benzos.

They switched me to Olanzepine and Lithium. The Olanzepine made me tired, but if I wasn't sleepy it made me feel delirious until I slept it off. My physician did a blood test for Lithium content and found that I was sub-therapeutic. Repeated the test and found out my liver enzymes were VERY high from the Olanzepine and my lithium levels were at a therapeutic level. I was feeling depressed throughout but functional and still able to socialize though I wasn't able to look for another job, which I still haven't been able to do yet. I was taken off the Olanzepine and told to compensate with more benzodiazepines. I had increasing bad feelings which I tried to compensate with increasing benzodiazipine dosage. I had an anxiety attack where I didn't know what to do to feel safe and it led to  an episode of uncontrolled rage where I damaged my own property and was re-admitted to hospital for depressive-mania. I was taken off the Lithium and given high dose Quetiapine which caused me to sleep all day for 2 days. Once I couldn't sleep it off it made me feel delirious and I requested to stop taking it. Drug withdrawal was absolutely brutal in many ways, and I felt like I went crazy. For the next week or two I felt very balanced (which everyone around me agreed with) and like a beacon of mental stability. However, I would get overwhelmed very easily, was extremely sensitive to noises (could hear static from electric wires), and needed to process my anxiety in silence where it like I was going to drive myself into a state of permanent psychosis. A few weeks later and I feel like my old self again except i'm getting lots of headaches. I'm depressed, a bit anti-social even though I'm lonely, unmotivated to do anything, barely feel like eating though I'll bing eat junk food. I don't feel like I have any risk of going manic again. My psychiatrist wants me on Lamotrigine but I just want a little break from the meds and really don't like the sound of that one or feel hopeful about it. I still want to take a lower dose of antidepressants and have read a couple papers supporting the use of antidepressants in bipolar. I know i'm not the best judge of my own treatment, I just don't want to feel like life is pointless and hard while also feeling hopeless for anything more than brief intermissions of feeling OK.

So my questions are: 
Does a single acute manic episode on a variety of medications (amongst rec. drug use and other factors) guarantee a bipolar 1 diagnosis is correct? Should I give up on the possibility of retrying the antidepressants that made me feel good because of this manic episode?

Is an episode of rage behavior while on Lithium and high dose benzodiazipines indicative of bipolar 1?

"I got a new doc via county services about six months ago. I've seen her three times, each worse than the one before it.

My lithium go to high so it was reduced. Aside from bipolar I also have generalized anxiety disorder. She refuses to treat the latter as ""your meds should take care of that. Go to therapy."". When I told her I was in therapy she had no response.

She got upset when discussing propanol. If I take it scheduled I have no way to treat panic attacks. I took it religiously for years and it was used as a back up if I had breakthrough symptoms such as a panic attack.

I've been diagnosed twenty years. As said I've seen her three times and she thinks she understands more than I do about my emotional state.

To further this I have to get doctor approval to sign my DPS forms so I can drive legally. She will not sign it for any reason. When asked it's clear she doesn't want to be liable, but it only causes more issues for me.

My last appointment was 4 minutes long. I timed it. After a year using county services I just got a case worker. I told the case worker to what was up and she offered a new doc. Part of my issue is my current doc (she's really a psych nurse) has a heavy accent and I barely understand her. I was told any other clinician would have the same issue.

I had a similar issue a couple years back. I changed docs and it was night and day.

As I write this I understand the path. I have to get a doc interested in me, and is willing to talk. How could I possibly relay the last two months in four minutes? Despite me providing 5 years of notes from other docs she has never read mine. Why? She doesn't have it. Despite sending it, having the last doc send it, and it being dropped off personally they don't have it.

I'm being treated as if this was my first psych doc. Not even close. This means my thoughts and concerns aren't founded in reality, but instead delusions. That's fucked.

She also drug tested me without telling me. I use CBD to help with a number of things. Drug use didn't come up despite knowing it will be there because she is focused on keeping interaction to a minimum.

I needed to vent. Anyone else despise their clinician? Having issues?

My current cycle is one major episode every couple of years which is coming up shortly. I'm self aware, know when I need help, but the idea of managing psychosis outpatient won't work so if anything happens the dance of getting hospitalized starts and will leave my life in ruin.

I have the urge to go somewhere with just him and I for our five year anniversary in October.  It sounds like he doesnâ€™t want to.  He always brings up money.  I donâ€™t have access to our bank account anymore.  Meaning the online banking.  The password changed and I canâ€™t reset it. So I am not sure how much we have in our account. 

I have had the urge to travel or try something new and it never happens.   Our sex life sucks.  In my depressive stage and after having my babies I had a low libido.  But as of lately I am interested in sex again .  Heâ€™s turned me down a few times.

Before I was on medication I spent money on unnecessary items when shopping.  This stuck out to my psychiatrist as well as the depressive mood.

"Iâ€™ve been manic for 3 weeks. In the meantime I moved in with a random girl who was looking for a flatmate. Sheâ€™s partying 3-4 times a week, she always has a random guy over and sheâ€™s really cheerful. Because of me being manic we instantly hit it off: we joked about our flat turning into a sex dungeon, we drank a lot and bonded over our hookup stories. But the truth is, Iâ€™m never like this. I barely drink, I am quite shy and looooove being at home and doing nothing. I hate parties, I prefer reading alone and I donâ€™t like having sex with random people. Now I am scared that when mania passes, she will see the real me she will be disappointed.

I also met a guy who is really nice, we worked great together and I am having feelings for him. But heâ€™s also a really happy, warm person, he is constantly doing something, loves adventures. Yesterday I felt my mania beginning to calm down. I was laying in bed next to him and got lost in thought: for the first time in weeks I stopped talking and got real quiet, which is actually my usual state. He instantly noticed the change and started asking me if Iâ€™m ok and what am I thinking about and he seemed worried, when in reality, I was finally myself again.

"(Trigger warning: mention of SH thoughts) 
(Sorry for formatting Iâ€™m on mobile).                     
My dad developed bipolar around 22-24 years old I believe, not exactly sure the exact age, but it was his early 20s. My sister and I, while having many mental issues were relieved that bipolar wasnâ€™t one that we inherited, but I am 18 now and things are different. I was diagnosed with MDD a few years ago and I take medication for it, still trying to find out what works but overall doing okay on that front. I recently got a new therapist as my depression has spiraled and itâ€™s worse than it ever has been and itâ€™s much different this time too.                   
There are some things that stand out as new, like explosive anger. Iâ€™ve never gotten so angry in my life, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m going to melt or explode because I canâ€™t contain it. I throw things and breakdown and no matter what I do to try and calm myself I just canâ€™t, it doesnâ€™t go away until it wants to. The things that I get angry over are trivial and stupid, but no matter how many times I tell myself I shouldnâ€™t be this mad over it I canâ€™t get rid of the rage. I get so mad that I start laughing and then crying and itâ€™s a mess. This depression also just feels different, itâ€™s so heavy and destroys my life. I canâ€™t do anything I canâ€™t think straight I have SH urges for the first time in a very long time and something about this sadness is different. Iâ€™m not sure how to explain it, but I know itâ€™s different.                                                
Well as I explained these things to my therapist and other things in my life she told me that she thinks I could possibly be developing bipolar like my dad. The thought terrifies me because I canâ€™t handle anymore problems, and his bipolar destroyed our family. I donâ€™t want this, but my therapist said that if itâ€™s genetic and I have the gene then I canâ€™t stop it, only find ways to manage it. I told my therapist that I havenâ€™t had any mania symptoms, so Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s what it is, but she said that mania presents itself in different ways and if o have it Iâ€™m probably just barely starting to develop it. The only â€œmania symptomsâ€ I have had are extreme anger and a random extreme spike in libido, but those arenâ€™t necessarily mania I thought.                              
There are many parallels between my dads depression and mine, and he and I actually respond positively to two medications, the same two (Lexapro and Wellbutrin), but Iâ€™m still trying out different meds so that could change.

"So, disclaimer. I am not in any immediate danger. I am medicated and in an okay place. I just wanted to know if anyone else did this.

About 10 years ago (right before I met my wife) I pre wrote some going away notes. Basically last wishes stuff and some things to get off my chest that I couldn't say out loud. They were addressed to family members and my now ex girlfriend. Written in a mixed episode, during psychosis, I sewed them into the liner of a leather jacket I never wear. 

Cue the day before yesterday. My daughter wants the old leather jacket. Cool, put patches on it. Punk Rock af. Take it. My wife goes and grabs it and feels the packet in the liner. She fortunately took them out and away, out of my daughters sight. But.... they were never sealed and she was confused as to why I had a letter to my ex. 

She read them. All of them. Stuff that I've never told anyone about my childhood, my drug use back then. All kinds of manic rants on page after page of legal pad paper, front and back. To people I no longer speak to (my family is incredibly toxic).

 My wife, has seen me in brief spurts of non medication. Never where I was then, with no meds and no insurance. Self medicating was all I had. She's been really quiet the last couple of days. Still communicating, but I can tell she's worried and stressed. I want to hug her and tell her I'm not that person anymore. But I know it's still in there. Just controlled.

We haven't really talked about it other than her saying I should've thrown them away, and asking me when I wrote them.

I don't know what to do. Has anyone else had something from a bad episode crop up like this? What do I say to her? Because there's no guarantee it couldn't happen again. I'm not going to lie to her. I don't think I'll let it get that bad again, but who knows? What if it's out of my control? I just don't know what to do besides give her space.",bipolar_disorder

While my episodes are less frequent than they used to be, they are more intense. FWIW, I was diagnosed with BP1 at 19, I am now 35, with multiple hospitalizations. I know that my current Hx of trauma and homelessness are exacerbating everything, but it must hit me today that the huge increase in intensity of symptoms came about mostly since I was pregnant in 2019. I went off my meds as soon as I found out I was pregnant because I didn't trust they could be safe enough for my son, and the effects on me were devastating. For the record, I have decided that for any future pregnancies, it would be healthier for me and my baby to stay on a couple of my meds. But as a result of going off my mess while pregnant, raging hormones, and ongoing trauma, I had about 3 psychiatric hospitalizations during my pregnancy. And since giving birth, I was fairly stable for a while, but the episodes I have had since then have been completely out of control, more severe, and unpredictable than ever before.

Itâ€™s taken a LONG time to get here. From misdiagnoses to his general reluctance to following through with appointments, Iâ€™m exhausted, and I can only imagine what that means for him. 

Heâ€™s been on 20mg Lexapro for maybe a year now (for maybe-sort-of letâ€™s-see-if-this-works depression/anxiety) with hardly any change. My limited understanding is that SSRIs do very little to help people diagnosed bipolar and can sometimes make the oscillation between highs and lows worse. 

Heâ€™ll be tapering off that and also starting Trileptal (unsure of the dosage, but I think itâ€™s 2x a day) and a small dose of Seroquel to help with sleep. I imagine heâ€™s gonna feel like shit for awhile; he was super nauseous when starting the Lexapro.

"I am 34. Diagnosed at 15. Iâ€™ve had several jobs every one of which made me worse and I have evidence of that. I plan to have all my medical records, prescription records to prove I stayed on meds for years and had follow ups regularly, personnel records from all my jobs showing the issues I had (including retail, food service, call center, WFH health insurance customer service, medical records clerk, and medical administrative assistant). I also went to college and didnâ€™t finish due to my issues but donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s worth submitting any records because I did work full time at one point and ace my classes only dropping the math related ones because I have a learning disability related to math that was not yet diagnosed and those classes caused me to break down. This was at a community college. I also have two bankruptcies owed to excessive spending in mania which was exacerbated at work. I have bipolar 1, borderline personality disorder, â€œsevereâ€ ADHD, and the learning disorder with math which the psychiatrist said is related to ADHD. Oh. And my IQ is apparently 68 which is apparently just under what the SSA deems the minimum IQ to not be, please forgive this terminology because I believe it is theirs, â€œmildly retardedâ€. Feel free to correct that. I really mean no offense and I do NOT use that word. I also plan to submit letters from two family members and a friend who both worked with me for several years and has maintained a personal friendship with me as well as making sure I have support from all my doctors. My mom is helping me get all this together because, letâ€™s face it, Iâ€™m not totally capable of that which is why Iâ€™m applying to begin with. Family has been encouraging me to apply for years but it just felt like giving up to me and I am having a hard time dealing with that. But itâ€™s time. I know it will likely still get denied and be a fight but I have to face this. I need it. 

When we have everything together, I am going with my mom down to the office to apply with all this info in hand. 

So anyway, my questions. 

Is there any sample letters or anything I can give to the family and friends writing the letters to know the kind of info that will be relevant? Not in any way telling them what to say.

"Went through a brief hypmanic episode about a month ago and ended up scaring my partner. They're a bit new to me, at least realizing them for what they are. This one only lasted a couple of days.

I was in a really amazing, euphoric mood with a ton of plans for these grand acts I would do for my partner and myself. My partner described me as childlike and unable to understand reality. I started painting painting painting, planning trips around the world, applying to jobs I am completely unqualified for, spending more money than I usually do on silly fun objects, texting friends and people I hadn't spoken to in months to years, etc. My partner was trying to calm me down, get me to go to bed because it was nearing 1 AM and they were exhausted. 

I came up with the grand idea to bike downtown and paint them a mural of something they love. While they thanked me for the gesture, they said that was incredibly dangerous and there's no way I'd be going. And they're 100% right, in my right mind I'd never do that at 1 in the morning, bike to the city which is at least an hour or two bike away. 

Well, I started to get my helmet on and the tires pumped and was ready to head out. My partner was so extremely stressed that they burst out screaming at me, in my face, and ran and slammed the bedroom door shut. They broke down crying on our bed. 

At the time, I remember struggling to wrap my head around this. Were they mad because I was going without them? Did they want to come too? Did I not pump the tires enough? Maybe I should use a different helmet! All very irrational things that at the time seemed completely rational. I even went in to apologize. They were eventually able to talk me out of the bike ride (I still went for a long walk headed towards downtown, then got distracted with something else and realized I needed supplies at home). 

I felt my mood lowering though over the course of the rest of the night (morning?). Their yelling really scared me, for them. I don't want to be stressing them out this much. I was recently diagnosed bipolar, but haven't experienced something like this with another person around me for this long of a time. I've been trying to see a therapist and psychiatrist (my insurance changed and I've been stuck on waitlists), but I don't know what to do in the meantime. And I can't get over how upset and angry they were in that moment. It keeps playing on repeat in my head, especially now that I'm fully aware why they were so rightfully angry. 

We've talked. I've told them it's okay if they want to leave/break-up, particularly when I've been depressed. I am so heartbroken with myself for causing this stress on them. I really want our relationship to work, but it's like they're in a relationship with my mental illness, not me. I can't wait to see these new professionals, dammit.

I have not found a decent medication for me, but I am functional enough to work or go to school now. I wasnâ€™t for the last couple years and just started getting better even though Iâ€™m not on meds. Of course Iâ€™m still no where near the norm. I have 3 bad days then 3 good or okay days. I also, have to go back to school and before my mental break down and diagnosis I was almost finished I only have 4 classes left. The thing is I was just functional enough back then and barely making it through a casual job and classes. I really miss those days though I was happy even though chemically I wasnâ€™t because I was productive and just took a sleep aid. Iâ€™m just scared of crashing and burning jumping into all this and still not being 100%. I am now 24, and hoping to get back to my 20 year old productiveness level. Any advice would be much appreciated if someone has been in this kinda situation.",bipolar_disorder
"Hi guys. I'm on Lithium and Desvenlafaxine so I can't drink alcohol and caffeine. For health reasons I also quit smoking and cut out social media. Long story short, my life was already pretty slow before going on medicatiom: I focused solely on not going too cuckoo bananas with bipolar on a daily basis, worked, dealt with family issues and that was it. I haven't had hobbies or anything since my childhood because I simply don't have energy for them.
But now that my life is calmer and I don't have too many mental health/family crisis, my days go by in unenjoyable stillness. I work from home as a secretary for less than a minimum wage so that's self-explanatory, I'm on break from college and the extra reading isn't all that exciting... so I just watch TV and clean all day but this routine is eating me up from the inside. I feel lazy and awful and just overall hopeless as to where I'm going with my life. I feel like an old lady. I can't even go out with people and have fun.
I do have dreams but I don't have goals so I don't know what steps to take. But then again, as soon as I try to sit down and study anything I immediately get uninterested and frustrated and give up.",bipolar_disorder
"Before being diagnosed with bipolar 2, I would have emotional swings and think nothing really of it. Until they were really bad. Now that I look at my actions and emotions through the lens of having bipolar, I feel like every time I show major emotion itâ€™s just me â€œbeing bipolarâ€.

For example, the other day I got very upset (both angry and sad/betrayed) by a friendâ€™s comment. He continued to talk about it even after he could tell I was getting upset. I yelled at him, and tried to tell him to stop talking about the subject. He continued for a bit until he finally dropped it. After that, I had to ask his girlfriend who was there if I was just out of line. She said I wasnâ€™t, but the whole interaction still caused me to spiral for the next few days. 

I feel like Iâ€™ve developed a fear of acting on any intense emotion because Iâ€™ll just be the person that either flies off the handle or canâ€™t just toughen up and stop being sad. Does anyone else feel this way? And do you chalk it up to anxiety or do you think itâ€™s a justified thing to think or worry about?",bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™ve been in a mixed state now for a month or so. I thought I was depressed but actually had some mania symptoms alongside it all. Iâ€™m averaging 3 hours sleep a night and even that is broken for the past 4 weeks. I have just laid in bed for 2.5 hours listening to sleep meditations and even had a sleeping pill but I just canâ€™t switch off. I donâ€™t know whether I should call someone from my mental health team, I was in hospital in Feb this year and so scared to go back there. Usually, prescription sleeping pills will make me sleep but this time they arenâ€™t. Iâ€™m so frustrated because Iâ€™m doing all the right things to sleep and yet my brain wonâ€™t shut off. Does anyone have any tips for this please? Also I donâ€™t know whether to call the team or not because I donâ€™t know what else really they can do? Thanks for listening, Iâ€™m just feeling really lonely and canâ€™t speak to people around me about this as I donâ€™t want to be a burden.",bipolar_disorder
"hi!

i was wondering if any of yall - like me - are both bipolar &amp; adhd, and if you could provide any insight on your experience with ADHD meds.

im excited cuz im finally getting in to see someone for ADHD meds, but my previous psychs have said that it can be hard to find one that works without triggering mania or depression.

i know that everyones different, and that i can work thru these q's w my psych in a month, but in the meantime \~ 

have any of you found a adhd med + bipolar med balance that works for you? if so, how long did it take for you to find a reliable med? if not, what was your experience? would you recommend the med route? any other insights &amp; info is appreciated! i also love resources :)",bipolar_disorder
"I am f29, just got my bp2 diagnosis. Itâ€™s been really hard for me to wrap my head around, I also just found out this week that one of my best friends growing up suddenly passed away. I have a lot of things to work out with my new diagnosis and process this loss. I have been on only antidepressants for the last decade not knowing I was bipolar. 

My doctor is having me try out new medications for my bipolar. So far abilify is a no, it makes me manic. Iâ€™m having a really hard time with my emotions. 

Iâ€™m thinking of taking a leave of absence from work, but the job I have because itâ€™s part time doesnâ€™t qualify me for any paid leave. Me and my husband are struggling already financially. We really canâ€™t afford me not to work. We live with my parents because our rent went up too high. Thereâ€™s a lot going on in my life thatâ€™s causing me anxiety depression and making my illness worse. 

I want to take time off to focus on my mental health, and to try to find the right medication. But I donâ€™t know how long that will take. Has anyone been in this kind of situation before? Iâ€™m at a loss of what to do.",bipolar_disorder

"Not looking for a diagnosis or anything, just want to see if anyone has gone through something similar. Basically about a month and a half ago I was diagnosed as type 2 bipolar or maybe cyclothymia and was put on Gabapentin as an off label mood stabilizer, a month went by and the meds didnâ€™t work for me at all and not to get too into it but my psychiatrist I just felt was being generally very mean to me for no reason and I was impatient with continuing Gabapentin, definitely a fault on my part as I should have just stuck with her and keep upping the dose but I made the mistake and am in the process of finding a new psychiatrist. I then saw a psychiatrist through my university who is supposed to only be short term until I find a permanent one outside of the university but basically at that appointment she didnâ€™t say I was or was not bipolar but that meds can have horrible side effects and she wasnâ€™t going to prescribe me anything. She definitely was sort of dropping hints that all of my problems sound like things I should just work through in therapy and I feel like my therapist is also thinking that I might not actually be bipolar (weâ€™ve only had like 3 sessions or so so far) Iâ€™ve contacted another psychiatrist but havenâ€™t met with them yet. I guess Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone has been misdiagnosed as bipolar but then later found out that they donâ€™t have any mental illness diagnosis at all? If Iâ€™m being honest maybe I was just happy for a diagnosis to explain why I am the way I am or maybe just wanted something quick like medicine to help fix my problems. I know it probably sounds dumb iâ€™m just so tired of intake appointments and not understanding how I feel or why I feel the way that I do. Thx for reading me vent",bipolar_disorder

I've been on lithium for a couple months now. Really ever since I got out of the psych ward I've been taking it consistently. But fuck the side effects are starting to become overwhelming. My body won't stop tingling and I'm really nauseous. Plus lithium hasn't really helped my depression. To be honest it may have made it worse. I just feel a dark cloud engulf me and the only thing I want to do is sleep. I have no motivation to play video games or read or really do anything other than go to work and barely survive... fuck why do I have to have this disorder.

"I've had undiagnosed, untreated bipolar for most of my life. I'm now on medication for BP2 (a diagnosis I completely agree with) and it's really helping me. My concentration, my motivation is back (this was the huge one for me), my good (but not over-the-top) mood is back, my normal sleep cycle is back. But one thing that hasn't come back from the last really bad depression I was in prior to seeking treatment is (sorry for the TMI) my sex drive.  I'm really bummed about this because I now seem to be unable to sexually function. When I  try to get in the zone with my partner, I just zone out and think about stuff I have to do, or I think about how weird sex is. Sometimes I don't know how to ask for what I want; other times *I* don't even know what I want. I now *want* to want sex, which is different from the depressed me; I just seem to have lost the ability to do it. Everything around sex feels very awkward and alien to me suddenly. 

The other day I had a realization: *I have no idea how to have sex as a healthy person.* Most of my life I've had higher-than-average libido, and I think this is because hypersexuality can be a symptom of hypomania. Most of my memories of sex are associated with that ""glowing and euphoric"" feeling I now realize is a hallmark of hypomania. I used to be really confident in bed and fairly uninhibited. In my untreated days, I had tons of sexual partners, lots of casual sex and group sex. I craved sex a lot of the time and always sought new sexual experiences. I'm ready to calm down a bit with that, and I appreciate that some of this shift might just be getting older and more mature. I no longer need sex to be a huge part of my identity. 

But it sucks that without that ""glowing, godlike"" feeling going along with it that I used to get when I was hypomanic, sex has become boring to me. I really hate feeling like there's this big part of the human experience I'm cut off from. Plus I really love my partner, and I crave the intimacy we shared when we were having sex regularly. 

I guess these are pretty personal questions, but I don't know where else to find the answers, so:

1. Does this check out as a thing that can happen? Has anyone else experienced this?
2. How did you deal with it? Did you just accept it, or did anything help you learn how to enjoy sex as a non-(hypo)manic person? 
3. How do you recalibrate your enjoyment of, and appetite for, sex to what's normal? 
4. How long did it take?",bipolar_disorder

[""The recent advent of interest in pharmacoepigenetics of psychiatric disorders is an alternative research avenue. The epigenetic modification known as DNA methylation (DNAm), one of major epigenetic modifications, is the product of the interaction between genetic variants and environmental influence, and for this reason might be a better predictor of treatment outcomes (Kubota et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2013). Measurable in peripheral blood, alterations of DNAm have been reported to be involved in both the pathology and drug treatment of SCZ, BD, and MDD (Schroeder et al., 2012; Vialou et al., 2013; Jaffe et al., 2016). Drugs may exert their effects by reversing these DNAm deregulations. Moreover, some FDA-approved drugs, like clozapine and sulpiride, have demonstrated the ability to activate brain DNA demethylation (Dong et al., 2008). Therefore, DNAm is a promising molecular approach to study mechanisms and prediction of drug response in psychiatric disorders (Goud Alladi et al., 2018; Lisoway et al., 2018). However, the reproducibility of those results, crucial for their clinical application, has not been thoroughly evaluated.""](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.674273/full)",bipolar_disorder

"Previously saw doctor person and was diagnosed bipolar 2, adhd and social anxiety. Which all makes sense considering well me. Now trying to make progress on getting things under control bc management by force of will is exhausting. So finally made appt and saw a people to get started.

Was told that adhd is only a childhood thing then your brain fixes itself when you go through puberty, that he doesn't think I need any medication just talk therapy and that I don't fit the bipolar 2 but bipolar unspecified. But prescribed risprodol to stabilize my mood while I get started on the therapy and settled in.

Other than the adhd thing he seems to be good at his job. So not sure if I should stick it out for a while and try to see if itll work out well (I suppose it's possible that I'm not adhd just bipolar that looks like it?) or should find another psychiatrist that at least believes adults can have adhd.

"Okay so basically I applied at a company and we're going to call it PB&amp;j and after the interview, I filled all my personal information forms and I never got a call back. My training was supposed to start on Aug. 14th so I was like okay cool I'm supposed to receive an email to tell me how to set up the system on my personal computer, work from home job easy enough.

The 14th comes and goes but on the 14th, I called and emailed multiple different people and left a voicemail. Today the 17th, I decided to call corporate because I'm kind of feeling like I got scammed maybe they wanted my ID and social information and that's why it seemed like it was like a ruse to you know scam me. 

The lady gets on the phone from PB&amp;j corporate office and she tells me that apparently they had called me multiple times on the 14th and prior to that to set up my computer for the new job and they had also sent me an email to set up my computer. The PB&amp;j corporate lady even goes as far as to tell me someone answered MY phone and said ""these hoes"" and hung up. Immediately, I'm concerned because I live alone and I received none of these phone calls or email, she's saying I received. I thank her for her time after she tells me I have to reapply for the position due to me declining the position by not responding to them and I get off the phone.

I had asked her four questions, what number did they call to contact me? what email did they use to contact me? what email address did they email me from? And what number did they call me from? Based on all the information she provided me, my call log showed no calls from pbj or any other unknown number for that matter for the 14th or before. Then for the maybe the 10th time I check my emails/Spam again for the said 'email that I received"" there was none.

So I proceeded to send a long email explaining all of this and the screenshots asking where or how did this happen that I ""declined employment by ceasing communication with the company"" to corporate pbj but all they have to say is just reapply. Hell I might not even get hired now because I sat here and went off on y'all because y'all got some sketchy s*** going on, or someone not doing their job. But I really want an explanation on how this happened cause the facts I have versus the story they telling me ain't adding up and I don't fair well with wrong doing against me for no reason, or things just not adding up when it affects me.

" I know how it sounds just hear me out.

 I've noticed a phenomenon where people with neurodivergencies tend to be more intuitive and sensitive to their realities. Whether it's autism, brain damage or mental illness the person affected is usually in tuned to the world around them. 

  Many times in my life, I have predicted things that would happen. Usually it comes to me in visions or feelings. It's been happening a lot more recently than it did when I was younger. 

  Exactly a year ago, I was driving with my fiance (now husband) and this feeling of pure dread and terror came over me. I imagined a threat to my physical safety, made by another human being. In this flash moment of anxiety I had the thought of someone threatening me with a gun or a knife. Like I would be penetrated by either a bullet or a blade and they would make me bleed. I chalked it up to an irrational random panic attack. Days later my husband was shot in the back by robbers and almost bled to death, but was resuscitated on the operating table. I almost lost him and it was the worst experience of my life.

 The most recent example was from only a month ago. I was drinking with my younger sister and then my imagination was showing me pictures again. This time I saw my sister driving her Jeep on the gravel road to her house, before losing traction and sliding off the road into the ditch sideways and rolling. This scared me and she noticed so she asked me what was wrong. I told her not to drive when the roads are icy and explained what I saw. She laughed it off and said she's sure she'll be fine. A week later she sends me a video she recorded of her and her dog in the Jeep. The SUV was lying on its side, and her dog was standing inside on the passenger window. She'd sent me a video of the aftermath of her crash, luckily she and her dog were unharmed. 

 I know these aren't delusions because my family members remembered my predictions and know now to heed my warnings. Does anyone else have anything similar happen to them? Do you think there's a connection between mental illness and psychic abilities?",bipolar_disorder

"I wanna preface by saying that I understand the need for covid restrictions and guidelines, I care greatly about the needs of the vulnerable in my community and would hate to contribute to the spread of covid. In writing this rant, I am painfully aware that many have lost loved ones or gotten sick themselves and my heart goes out to them. 

That said, the restrictions are forcing me back into habits that scare me. I live in Montreal, QC where gyms are closed, all gatherings are prohibited other than those you live with, and you are not allowed outside your property after 10pm. This past year I have finally started making a conscious and dedicated effort to treat my bipolar after being involuntarily committed following my most recent suicide attempt. I am still early in my recover efforts and only three things have helped me get by. 

From September - December I have followed a rigid, unwavering daily schedule. I did the exact same thing every day for four months and it helped me manage my diet and sleep schedule. Gone were the weeks of skipping meals and sleeping too much or too little. With these new restrictions I am forced to attend my lectures online. In a studio apartment, my space for sleeping and eating has now become my workspace.My schedule is impossible to follow and I am losing track of time. 

during this same period I went to the gym every weekday; 5 days a week first thing in the morning. Since losing this aspect of my recovery plan, the symptoms of psychomotor agitation have become all consuming. I am covered in bruises from punching myself and bumping into things as the physical symptoms of my anxiety drive me into a visceral panic. I am unable to go on runs due to previous injury, it is hard to find an adequate replacement to weight lifting. 

Finally, I am 113 days sober from drugs and alcohol. My AA meetings have been cancelled and I donâ€™t feel confident about finding a new online meeting that will provide me the support I need. I am struggling to stay sober more now than ever. 

I am posting this because it is difficult to discuss this with my peers. I fear coming across as someone who doesnâ€™t care or believe in Covid. I understand why these measures are in place, but I am scared for myself. I donâ€™t want to fall back in my recovery to the point that I do something I regret.",bipolar_disorder
"I find it hard to justify to myself that the delusions and hallucinations I've felt and seen during episodes are 100% false/ not real. I tend to think they are tied in to some greater meaning I'll find some day. I have 3 main categories of weird:

1: I ""hallucinate"" real things happening - real conversations that people forget after we've talked, real actions people take that they don't remember, real songs that I listen to and can never find again. Live TV starts glitching out like basketball games and such. It looks like the players are on roller skates (not literal skates on their feet) and they have difficulty holding on to the ball. Star wars played the same scene on repeat on TV with commerical inbetween.

2: I ""caused"" real things to happen: me and another patient said ""I think X will happen"" for an entire day, and those exact things happened over and over. Too many times to be coincidence. The key was we had to both agree + think it at the same time.
A. *checks fridge, no apple juice, closes door* ""I think there is apple juice in the fridge"" ""i think so too"" *reaches in eyes closed to the very back, grabs - it is an apple juice. Then I drank it.*
B. ""I think this person will walk forwards, stop, turn left, sit down, write one word, look left, then stand up"" ""i think so too"" *exactly what we said happened*
C. *2pm* ""I think it's dinner time"" ""I think so too"" *I get up for no reason, as if under a spell, and do 3 fast laps around the complex. At the end of the third lap, the dinner cart appeared and it was 5pm*

3: Then there's the category of things I've hallucinated that are obviously hallucinations but still support my beliefs that something weird is happening in the world that doesn't make it real. That we're all under some form of control/being brainwashed. People get taken over with spinning blue eyes like they're under hypnosis. Propaganda/ historical images/animated cartoons flashing in my eyes when I close them - this happened for several hours one night I was having an episode and wasn't sleeping. Voices themselves getting taken over and having a devilish tone - same tone different people. Parents temporarily turning into animated cartoon animals. Hitler mustaches appearing on people.

What the heck am I supposed to do? It's especially hard to let go of the real world glitches I've seen - categories 1 and 2. Do you hold on to anything you've hallucinated as real? How do I either prove or disprove that I'm being controlled/brainwashed when I just get heavily drugged every time I see this stuff?",bipolar_disorder

We met 3 years ago and dated for almost one year until he breakup with me last month. He said that he cannot sustain a relationship if in one month he is bad and on other he is good, that he can't bring security to the relationship and that this is doing harm to him and to me, he said it's not about me, but about him. I understand his reasons, and know how he suffer. I just want to make he feel good, just want to be with him, take care of him, love him. I don't know if I wait some months (his psychiatrist changed his medication shortly before the breakup and he was searching for psychological help at the time) for him to get better and adjust to the medications and therapy and try talk to him, to be together with him again or if I let him go. I don't want to hurt him, make he feel bad or make his situation worse. I want to do the best for him. Help me.",bipolar_disorder
"I feel like there are a few different categories of people when it comes to Bipolar Medications.  Which one (or two) are you (and feel free to make up your own category!)?

&amp;#x200B;

**TGFM (Thank God for Meds!):**  They might not be perfect, but medications have allowed you to live your life fairly normally.

&amp;#x200B;

**Love/Hate Relationship:**  You hate that you rely on medications, but you accept that they are the only reason you are functional.  You know you will have to take them indefinitely, but that doesn't mean you have to like it!

&amp;#x200B;

**Show and Share:**  You have given up being embarrassed by your medications and instead you post about what you take or show off pictures of all of your pills in your hand or maybe in your pill organizers.  If you have to take 'em, might as well eliminate the stigma by sharing all about it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Resigned, At Best**:  You hate medications, but you haven't been able to live without them.  You are always pushing for lower doses, or for trials without them, but as of yet you still need to rely on them to get through the day.

&amp;#x200B;

**All Natural:**  You hate medications, and if you take them, it is only because you have to temporarily.  Optimally, you will only take things that you consider natural.  Screw lithium, but you welcome lithium orotate.  Damn anti-psychotics, but you welcome marijuana in all its forms.",bipolar_disorder
"Hi there, I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a year and a half and she was diagnosed with bipolar when she was a teen. It hasnâ€™t been easy but we come along way. She broke up with me two days ago after a series of two heavy arguments and said she is tired of me and my attitude (I sadly spazzed out on her as she was yelling at me and insulting me because I told her to stay home as she was exposed by covid and I snapped and lost my temper) and is saying she is truly done with me and means it. She has done something similar before where she blocks me on everything and says she is done but normally by next day we resolved it. This time she has deleted pictures of us on her social medias and just says she is done and itâ€™s too late and itâ€™s been two days now. I am texting her off a texting app since she blocked me. What is confusing is she texted my mom yesterday saying she tested positive and wrote her very sweetly like she always does and I went to her house after and she just said same thing she is done with me and Iâ€™m not worth it and wouldnâ€™t talk to me. Her family is telling me to give her some days but I just canâ€™t tell if she truly means it right now or if itâ€™s an episode. She has been stressed and yesterday tested positive so it seems she was angry as well according to her mother.

"I (21F) am currently living in my family home, after a rough 2021. Iâ€™ve seen 4 psychiatrists now, and have confirmed bipolar II. Even so, my parents are convinced that I just have â€™a bit of depression and anxiety, like everyone elseâ€™. Theyâ€™re very against medication, and were pleased when I came off abilify cold turkey. They donâ€™t agree with antidepressants either. So now Iâ€™m unmedicated.

I know that part of the problem is that they donâ€™t know the full extent of my symptoms. They know most of them but Iâ€™m unsure about telling them about behaviours such as SH and drug abuse. I donâ€™t want to destroy my relationship with them. I also have the feeling theyâ€™d chalk that up to some other reason anyway. 

I have a self-help book that was recommended to me by one of the psychiatrists which I showed my mother. However, much of it talked about symptoms I either donâ€™t get at all (like psychosis) or donâ€™t get to that severity. I think it convinced her more that I donâ€™t have it.

Do I try and convince them or do I just let it go? Weâ€™ve had plenty of conversations but the last time we agreed just not to talk about it because it ends up being tense. 

Iâ€™m currently at the beginning of a severe episode of depression after a 2-month long mixed episode. Iâ€™m just so mentally exhausted but they donâ€™t understand. Somehow, theyâ€™re more convinced that itâ€™s long covid than anything else. I donâ€™t have long covid. I just want their support and understanding.

"Hey guys

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently 18 years old, back home visiting from college after my first semester. I love it there, my life overall is good but obviously, my mood does swing here and there as we know, we are bipolar. I broke up with my ex-girlfriend during my first week of college around September. She was the typical fucked up girlfriend you could imagine, a shit load of trauma, full of manipulative tactics, gaslighter, emotionally draining and avoidant-attachment style of love, whilst I was anxiously attached. Don't get me wrong i went through a lot in this relationship, but more so after than during, because when you are manipulated that harshly you only start to learn and realize once you detach from that person, that for me was breaking up with her. I am grateful I went through that because I learned a lot about myself, life and relationships. However, after we broke up a couple of months she fucked her only friend left, who was my close friend. She literally used to call him ugly, make fun of how he was probably closeted, and all this kind of shit. But then she fucks him?! There is nothing to love about either of the people and i DONT UNDERSTAND WHY SHE IS TRYING THIS HARD TO GET TO ME I KNOW SHE ISNT OVER ME BUT THIS SHIT JUST LIVES IN MY HEAD, IM SO FUCKING ANGRY, MY EGO IS HURT, I AM HURT AND I FEEL DISRESPECTED. I am such an accomplished person and Ive done loads for myself yet its always the stupid shit like this that interrupts the momentum of my day. I dont know what to do or think sometimes, all I feel is anger and embarrassment, I truly dont know how to move forward because i have so many healthy thoughts about as well as dangerous temptations to seek revenge. I just really want to move on from the things she did to me and is trying to still, I don't love her anymore, I don't have respect for her anymore, I don't give a fuck if she hangs herself, I don't care, all i want is my own peace because ultimately the only person who will always be in my life is me. Part of me is just shocked she did that because she didnt seem that petty, yes of course she can fuck whoever she wants, she is single, but I know her well, she did that cause he just gave her the slightest bit of attention and she fell for it and on top that she wanted to send me a message. On top all this, he snap chatted me and started telling me how good it was, guys im so fucking angry please help me im so scared of myself. I just cant live with these unhealthy thoughts, I am already working on myself but this is the one thing that stills bothers me. Am I making progress in my life? Of course. But could i do better and move on from this? Of course, I dont know who though.",bipolar_disorder

Can anyone relate?


Ok so, I was just diagnosed with BP1 and PTSD in May 2021 at the age of 25.    (Not the purpose of this post, buuuut it took me getting really sick until I was finally taken seriously).. anyways;

Growing up, I was always so high achieving and hardworking in academics and athletics, and in the back of my head I always thought I was destined for something greater (I think this was the first sign of my predisposition to BP). I didnâ€™t have much of a social life really because I mostly only found self-confidence in my achievements. I wasnâ€™t around many people as a kid and as a teenager who I thought could relate to me. What I committed myself to I was obsessed with, and saw all of my actions as part of this big picture I had in mind for myself. There were other signs of mental illness emerging during this time as well, and in retrospect, def pointed towards BP.   

My parents always were impressed/concerned with how big my hopes and dreams were, but I was reaching these goals and doing incredible things. Buuuut after experiencing so much terrible trauma in university and completely crashing and burning, I became stuck, almost like my mind was in knots. Like a shell of myself. And more symptoms were coming up.

Anyways, now that I am finally on the right meds, I feel like I can move forward, stable but still a bit fragile. That mourning process of lost years is gruelling thoâ€¦ 
Also tons of weed and then dabbling w shrooms (but in a big way)to try and self medicate my gruelling symptoms after just never getting a proper diagnosis, along with my doc tripling my Prozacâ€¦ made me deliriously manic, then hospitalized, now on proper meds. I believe substances got me to that #1 BP diagnostic spotðŸ¤© itâ€™s been a journey, but putting the pieces together is fascinating to me",bipolar_disorder

"Got diagnosed with bipolar disorder recently. After thinking of my anamnesis, I've remembered quite strange thing: after drinking alcohol, waking up and having hangover and then moving to study, I've got something (probably) strange going on: I was extra talkative and happy, some people told me it was strange but I didn't take it seriously, didn't really believe that I can be mentally ill or something like that.   


Even though hungover should be painful, I was feeling extra good. Not without usual physical alcohol hungover effects, of course. Mentally it felt like I was in the middle of carousel of emotions. Recently I've read that some bipolar people got the same... dunno, problem or side-effect?

"Hi y'all, I have a friend whos been having a bit of a rough time lately, and I figured maybe someone here might know how I can better help him. any advice is greatly appreciated.  He's not on Reddit but he gave me permission to post here asking for some advice. I'm not sure whether this breaks rule 7, but if it does I apologize and I will remove it. 

I already wrote a super long post here about a month back, but right as I was finishing my computer crashed and I lost it all. I'll try to be more brief this time, but the situation has changed a little bit since then so I have a few more details to include. 

My friend was initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years back (think late 2019 - early 2020) after he was hospitalized for suicidal ideations and self harm. As far as I know, he doesn't know whether he has bipolar I or II, and he was never really told much about his diagnosis or what it meant. Now he remembers his hospital stay as one of the best times of his life. he was put on medication which he had a great response to. he said he felt happy. Unfortunately, that didn't last long. Soon after he was discharged, his mom got rid of the medication and lied to him. she claimed there was a ""problem"" with their insurance. his mom is very against mental health treatment and honestly she's whats making the situation so much worse. she's controlling, manipulating, and emotionally abusive. everything revolves around her, and she'll do anything to get what she wants. he does have a great relationship with his dad, and he would be supportive of his son getting the help he needs, but his wife absolutely will not allow it. he's also pretty scared to talk to his dad about some of his symptoms because he doesn't want to worry him even more than he already is. 

With that being said, his symptoms are a little bit concerning. especially how quickly they've been getting worse. he has most of the symptoms you'd expect, the depressive episodes and the manic/hypomanic ones (I'm not a doctor so I'm not going to try and speculate which one they are) and all that stuff. what scares both of us the most though I think is the hallucinations. it started with smaller things and it still mostly is, dots in his vision or seeing people or things out of the corner of his eye. he's also heard things as well. I don't know whether these are happening during or outside of manic episodes, and he doesn't either because he doesn't know how to recognize them. however they do seem to be more common when he hasnt gotten as much sleep as he probably should or as he's about to fall asleep, but not always. recently he was also scared someone was watching him. this has happened a few times but this time he was really scared. he said it was a big man behind him, and every way he turned the man would always be behind him. He said the man was trying to kill him and if he put down his phone he would. I've  been trying my best to help him, but it's very difficult especially with the distance, because all I can see are the things he types and if he doesn't type anything I have no way of knowing whats going on. as hard as I can try, there's only so much google can tell me. I'm still a kid, both of us are. at the same time I'm barely holding myself together, and I want to help him but I don't know how. I just wish I could take his pain away.

As for our options, I'm not very hopeful unfortunately. There is absolutely no way he will be able to talk to his mom, and his dad couldn't either. She controls everything, and my friend and his siblings are all on her insurance. His dad has to take anti-anxiety medication, but it's all behind her back because if she knew all hell would break loose. there is one thing that might be able to help though, but we're not really sure how it'd work. earlier this year, our state passed a [new law](https://www.marylandmatters.org/2021/06/14/new-maryland-law-will-expand-adolescents-access-to-mental-health-care/) that allows kids over 12 to get mental health treatment without their parents consent. However, its not really explained anywhere how kids are supposed to find a provider, and providers can legally still tell parents that they are treating their child. since he is also on his mom's insurance, if she happens to check the statement she'll see that there's charges being made there. payment would also be a problem, because of copay. He's trying to get a job but as of right now he has no income. depending on where he could get treatment transportation could be a problem as well. 

Obviously trying to wait it out and getting help when he's 18 is an option, but that could also end very badly. three years is a long time. granted, it's almost two at this point but with the way things are changing who knows what could happen. I just want him to be safe and happy, he's genuinely one of the kindest, smartest, and most hardworking people I've ever met. if anyone's actually made it this far, I can't even begin to thank you. I know this is a really long post, but I tried to include what I thought was important so let me know if you have any questions. I will do whatever it takes to help him. even if it's just something small I can do to make sure he knows that I care about him when he's worried, I greatly appreciate any advice at all. Thank you all :)",bipolar_disorder

"Routine is exceptionally helpful in achieving stability with bipolar disorder. Especially sleep/wake times! I used to have a very strict morning and night routine, and it was one of the few times since diagnosis (and before!) that I was actually balanced and functional. Each time mine breaks (because they do, eventually, break- even for neurotypical people), I try to find the reason why and build my new one with that in mind. Similar, but hopefully better. Sometimes the reason was outside of my control, though.

The struggle is that *building* a routine when youâ€™re depressed, manic, or unorganized can be very difficult, but without that routine itâ€™s hard to come out of an episode. Sort of a catch-22: routine is needed for stability, stability is needed for routine.

Unfortunately i still lack the motivation and ambition required to really make my dreams a reality, and its hard to see that change. i just wish that i had pursued my artistic ambitions before my depression fully took over back when i was younger from around 18 to 21. im more than halfway thru my 20s and my depression gets worse every year, i dont know how to break out of it.",bipolar_disorder

its only day 1 but I don't know how much more I can take. life in general these past two months have been so traumatic and painful, wellbutrin put me in my first psychosis which led to two more psychotic episodes within that week. few weeks later had a thc induced psychosis and since then never stopped hallucinating if I'm not on an AP. The hospital traumatized me this week and put me in so much fucking pain and didn't help me for so long.

"I was going down rabbit holes this weekend about my meds(Prozac, Wellbutrin, Risperidone).  I have had type 2 diabetes since the early 00s, as well as fatty liver.  Never did I put 2 and 2 together to connect fatty liver and my meds.  I knew some of the meds I am/have been on affect blood sugar. But  I assumed it was all just genetics plus my diet for the liver.  But when I found a connection when looking things up and now I'm worried.  My psychiatrist doesn't seem concerned, but my regular doctor has been pushing me for better management of the diabetes.  I just started Trulicity in January and it helps a lot.  

However, all I can think of is statistics for fatty liver and how I'm basically setting myself up for cirrhosis in the future.  Is this a legitimate concern?  Should I really worry that much about this?  I see my gp for a regular check up in May, so I'm definitely going to get his input.  I guess I'm more worried about the Risperidone, as I just started taking it last summer.  It's done wonders for stabilizing my mood, so I don't want to stop it.  But if the risk is worse than the benefit....?  

I guess I just need someone to tell me to stop worrying so much.  I'm at the point where my dr. just keeps an eye on things to make sure it doesn't get worse.  But I feel like you should always think ahead and plan for the worst.",bipolar_disorder

"hey yâ€™all, 
first time posting here but Iâ€™m not sure what to do so hereâ€™s to firsts I guess. Iâ€™m struggling so hard, Iâ€™m pretty sure my BP has progressed into rapid-cycling (went from manic to depressive in the span of a week) and the depressive episodes are getting worse and worse. I havenâ€™t been on meds in a few years bc for about 2.5 I was doing alright but then lifeâ€™s been a rollercoaster the past 6-7 months and itâ€™s âœ¨startedâœ¨ again. I used to take seroquel and lamictal but the seroquel was causing me to pass out and faintâ€”I actually got a concussion one of the times I fainted. I tried to talk to my old dr abt it but I never got referred out, and then I tried Cerebral but they fucked me and never perscribed me anything after spending money on the service so I feel like whenever I do ask for help/try to get help itâ€™s for Jack shit. I have a new doctor now but idk if heâ€™s going to be able to perscribe me anything for my BP and heâ€™s had to refer me out twice for my sprained ankle and he never did (itâ€™s been 3 weeks now) so if he canâ€™t perscribe anything for my BP and I need to see a psychiatrist, Iâ€™m scared for myself that I wonâ€™t be able to wait that long and have to potentially wait even longer if he never sends out the referral. Idk what Iâ€™m asking for really, I guess tips on what to do? And do meds actually help? I feel like I canâ€™t remember what it was like to be on them, do you finally feel normal again? My soul is so exhausted I canâ€™t do this shit anymore, the BP has drained everything out of me. I obviously wonâ€™t be able to call the office til Monday and give or take a few days for the actual appointment so do you know what I can do for myself until then? I feel like whenever I try to soothe myself during depressive episodes it doesnâ€™t help. Ie I went to take my dogs to sit outside and I ended up tripping in the street and losing the last money I had to my name Iâ€™ve been trying to think of things that give me relief but nothing does. I love my pets but theyâ€™ve been a huge stress for me lately so I just get irritated thinking about it. Thereâ€™s not a thing about my apartment I enjoy it feels like a prison in a layer of hell designed for me; it is the main source of my anxiety and depression tbh. Would love to go out and go somewhere but that takes gas and Iâ€™m too depressed to go into the club and talk to men to make money. Donâ€™t have anything saved because Iâ€™ve been out on a sprained ankle. Canâ€™t even treat myself to a coffee to get a slight buzz of dopamine. Plus when Iâ€™m in an episode I borderline get agoraphobia so going outside and walking downtown where there a shit ton of people is super hard for me. Iâ€™m so ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜© rn

*and a bit of background below, if you'd like:*

i am mostly asking since i will be discussing with my psychiatrist next week if i fit the bill for bipolar 2 or not. i wanted to discuss this with her since i'm pretty sure trying wellbutrin for my ADHD and depression made me hypomanic, and i had to go off it completely after about 18 days. somehow i started learning more about what antidepressants can do to people with bipolar disorder, and i resonated with experiencing hypomania and the crashes of depression right after. this made me research even more about bipolar disorder, and now i'm beginning to question if i have it, since i noticed that i frequently experience this mood cycles.

iâ€™m an 18 year old med student. i was diagnosed 2 years ago. iâ€™ve lived in 2 countries during these years and doctors from both countries have diagnosed me as bipolar. i used antipsychotics like aripiprazole and seroquel, antidepressants, trileptal, lamotrogineâ€¦ but iâ€™m not getting any results.
iâ€™m not the kind of person who expects meds to work magically, so i completely changed my lifestyle: i have a routine, i wake up early, study, work out, try to maintain a social life despite my heavy work loadâ€¦ but iâ€™m still not stable. the highs are very high but the lows are very low. itâ€™s so frustrating and exhausting. 
the side effects of these medications are ruining my life and my body. i had countless health issues caused by my meds. if they worked and made me stable i wouldnâ€™t complain, but iâ€™m honestly just exhausted at this point.

"So I recently started seeing a new doctor. She is probably the best I've seen since being diagnosed with BPD. She spends a hour with me each visit (and I still see my therapist once a week too) ans we talk about my stress factors, how I feel on my meds, what my goals are and she actually cares and explains options to me and gives me a choice with her ideas. It's honestly been an amazing experience because I have never felt like a real person since seeing a psych. 

Recently we did some testing and found out I am ADHD, she informed me there is a high comorbility rate between BPD and ADHD. She started me on Vyvanse and it has worked great in combo with my Trileptal.  I feel like I can focus again, I don't find myself word finding alot and just in general I feel calmer with it (and have some increased energy too). Overall I feel like I'm starting to make some progress on being stable and feel like I have a support system between my doctor, therapist, husband, brother and sister.

I donâ€™t have any friends. I donâ€™t like spending time with people. Thereâ€™s this guy that I really like and he likes me too, but he deserves better. I know he doesnâ€™t think badly of me, but we work together (at our on campus university restaurant), and even though he thinks Iâ€™m pretty, he probably thinks Iâ€™m a ditz.

"Hello! I(24F) want to have a conversation with my friends (one guy, one girl) about my behaviour in a way that is constructive without sounding like ""pity me"" or an excuse. 

Amongst my two friends, I am known as the ""flaky"" one. I only found this out recently when they got mad at me for not going with them to an overnight LAN party. (Really it was only my guy friend that openly was irritated with me but I think my girl friend was too since they seemed to have a talk about me before telling me I was flaky.) It really hurt my feelings because they know I have bipolar disorder and they also know I'm financially fucked right now and desperately looking for a job.  I didn't want to go to the overnight thing because I knew I didn't have the money and I didn't want to screw my sleep schedule over (I just got it kinda fixed). They (again only rlly the guy openly but my girl friend doesn't stand up for me) also made snide jokes about me not being ready to move out of my mom's house and in with them. 

I have this little habit that I'm sure some of you also have where I make a lot of unrealistic plans when I'm in a manic state. So I tend to be the one in our friend group who plans out events and things but I'm also the one who usually can't attend these events due to money issues or depression. I was the one who brought up moving in together before the pandemic while I was in a manic state. Then the pandemic hit and I lost my job (my only source of income) and fell into a deep depression. In the last two years, ive fallen heavily into debt and behind pay for rent and utilities. I've been surviving mostly with the support of my mom :) but my friends made comments about it like ""oh of course she won't move out ðŸ™„. She rather live with her mom."" or stuff similar to this. It's very condescending imo.... They act like I'm some sort of mess (even though I'm the only one able to hold a job for longer than 2 years and I'm the only one that can easily make friends... Ok that was bitchy of me ðŸ‘€ I apologize but I hate the way they're making me feel recently.)

I know it's not right of me to make plans I can't follow thru with which is why when I make plans I try to make them as broad as possible... for example when I made plans for us to do an art class together I said specifically ""in the future, when we are all ready"", but I just found out today they took that as literally next week so they booked class places without me and when I asked them why they did that they said ""well we knew you'd flake so we didn't bother."" It really hurt. They knew I wanted to do it together, it was literally the only reason I made the plans... They also know I don't have the money and I'm looking for a job but it feels like they low-key don't even consider any of my issues when they're mad at me. 

I like my friends. I think they're very fun about 90% of the time, which is why when they do fucked up things or piss me off I always try to understand why they did it and come to an understanding. But this? Idk it seems like time and time again they're unwilling to understand me. I understand what I do is probably annoying which is why I've been actively changing it and I might even be the in the wrong in this whole situation but I want to be able to explain myself without them feeling defensive or like I'm being defensive. I don't want it to sound like I'm using my bipolar disorder as a defense but I want them to know that it LITERALLY is because of my disorder and im trying to get better. I've stopped making definite plans and instead I make very broad open future ambitions I want to share with them but its them who takes it as a very literal ""RIGHT now we have to do that""... and it's always me who gets left out then told off for not being there.

Sorry if this was confusing! I can clear up any confusion in the replies. 

TLDR: my friends call me flaky for my manic planning then depression fall out. I want to explain to them that they're hurting my feelings without it being an attack on them. (Ie: how to have constructive conversations for dummies)

Ps: don't know if this is really relevant but I'm also autistic and sometimes I feel like that puts a wall between my friends and me. Again, they know I'm bipolar and autistic.",bipolar_disorder

"Things are going too well &amp; it kind of scares me. I'm very stable right now on my current regimen (Lithium, Lamictal, Prozac). I haven't had a hospital stay in over 2 years. I'm thriving at work. I haven't had anything worse than a mild dip in my mood in months. I don't remember the last time I had a morning where I couldn't get out of bed. My last hypomanic episode was when I first started Prozac, which was over a year ago.

I should be so happy about that &amp; I *am* happy about it, I'm not complaining, but it also gives me a degree of anxiety. I just feel like I'm always a little bit on edge just waiting for shit to hit the fan like it usually has in the past. I was cranky yesterday because a close friend of mine is in the hospital after a bad injury (she's going to be okay I think, don't worry). I started freaking out ""omg why am I cranky? Am I becoming depressed? Should I be worried? What do I do? What if I destabilize &amp; end up in the hospital? It definitely puts a damper on my peace.

I know it sounds stupid &amp; I should just be happy I'm doing well but I'm doing so well that I'm terrified of losing that. Anyone relate?

"Iâ€™m having a rough time, and Iâ€™m just struggling to see how it gets better.

My birthday is tomorrow, and as I reflect on the last several years, I canâ€™t help but to ask â€œwhat the fuck am I doing with my life?â€

I was hospitalized in 2017.  I was 32 at the time, completely broke, $10k+ in credit card debt, student loans, and I quit my job prior to going into the hospital.  I had to move back home to live with my sister because I had no other option.  Certainly grateful I had a place to go, but it was one of the last things I ever wanted to do.

I managed to get a job about 3 months after moving back in with my sister.  Was determined to get out of debt and was working my ass off.   Through determination and hard work, I managed to make almost $100k, paid off all my credit cards, was making progress on my student loans, living by myself, and bought a car for the first time in my life.

In June of 2020 I get the great idea to go out on my own.  I leave the company Iâ€™m working with, and in a matter of a few months I blow throw the couple thousand dollars I had saved and max all my credit cards paying my rent and living expenses.

Now itâ€™s 2022, Iâ€™m in more debt than I was in 2017, owe money to the IRS, have lost basically all my friends, and havenâ€™t been in a relationship for 7 years.  Depending on how things go the next month or two, Iâ€™m potentially looking at moving back in with my parents or my sister.  

I just donâ€™t know what to do at this point.  If I didnâ€™t have a supportive family I probably wouldnâ€™t be here right now.  I know I have it in me to get back on my feet, but I canâ€™t help but wonder if itâ€™s even worth it.  Is my life bound to be a cycle of recovery and complete destruction?  The sad thing is I have no one to blame but myself.  My own decisions have put me here. 

Iâ€™m just at a loss.  I know I should try, and I know I should care; but to be honest it doesnâ€™t even feel worth it.  It feels like anything I get Iâ€™m destined to lose.",bipolar_disorder

"For 6 weeks running I've been bad-tempered, hair triggered, and mean spirited to my S.O. I've been oversensitive, reactive, and nasty. Having difficulty empathizing. Emotional in general - getting watery eyed easily. It just sneaks up on me out of nowhere.

It didn't even occur to me that maybe my recent bad attitude was not, in fact, a reasonable/valid reaction to what's been going on between us and in our life. But maybe actually just the result of an episode. Didn't occur until he said last night ""I don't know whats going on with you right now but you are not yourself. Something is up."" This after I blew completely up over a small shitty thoughtless comment he had made. Like, ALL the way up.

First I immediately accused him of trying to gaslight me. But I spent a night and a day thinking about it and he may well be right.

hi. so iâ€™m diagnosed with bipolar II, but i feel i might have been misdiagnosed and be borderline instead. a therapist suggested it and said i should look into it, and it aligns much more with me than bipolar. i havenâ€™t gotten re-evaluated so i donâ€™t want to self diagnose, which is why iâ€™m posting this on r/bipolar!

anyway, for 6 years in my teens, i only knew intense and abusive relationships. i never had a healthy relationship, and i never got to see one. my mom is bipolar as well, and long story short, she wasnâ€™t exactly the greatest role model for relationships. so iâ€™m pretty much lost.

iâ€™ve been with my current s/o for nearly a year, and the beginning was great! heâ€™s kind, considerate, patient, and understanding. heâ€™s perfect for me. but iâ€™m not sure if iâ€™m perfect for him. i feel like damaged goods, and i feel like iâ€™ve been conditioned by my past groomers/abusers to be used to volatile relationships. now that iâ€™m in the steadiest relationship of my life, i feel like self sabotaging. i keep getting urges to do or say things to him that i obviously shouldnâ€™t. i guess iâ€™m feeling underwhelmed now that iâ€™m in a relationship without fights and abuse. iâ€™m getting annoyed more easily, and i donâ€™t want to. i was so used to constant fighting. the lows were insanely low but the highs were high enough to keep me in bad relationships. but heâ€™s the sweetest guy iâ€™ve ever met, and i genuinely love him. heâ€™s my best friend.

i donâ€™t know what to do. i donâ€™t want to tell him about my feelings because i donâ€™t want to hurt him. the last thing i want to do i make him feel how others have made me feel.

How many years after your first Bipolar Dx did a psychiatrist refer to your Bipolar as ""Treatment Resistant""?

Do you feel like your mania is more resistant to treatment, your depression, or both?


Which of these treatments have you tried for your Bipolar (and feel free to discuss your experiences)?

*Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
*Lithium

I first met her after she got out of the hospital for a suicide attempt, just prior to being diagnosed with bipolar.  We became very close but never romantic, more best friends.  I had feelings for her but she was always romantically involved with someone, so I never said anything.  None of her romantic relationships ever worked out due to her bipolar btw.

Anyways, fast forward 16 years and she recently became single and since I was also single, I decided to finally tell her how I had always felt about her.  It was a dream come true for about two weeks after.  She was hypersexual so that was quite the experience.  Then, out of the blue, she completely cut me out of her life.  No calls, no texts, no emails.  I haven't heard from her in going on two months.

I doubt there is anything I can do.  I feel that by having that two week fling with her, I've completely ruined our 16 year friendship.  I know this is her bipolar.  I'm really depressed and hope I see best friend again one day.

My problem is that I tend to invalidate my experiences a lot because I don't really have visible reactions. I believe that I have strong self control in most situations, and I constantly refrain myself from acting on my urges in all my romantic/friend relationships.


I cycle through emotions of anxiety, jealousy, possessiveness; and at the same time, I feel like I have so much love and joy to give â€“ more than what anyone can give me. Yet, I am able to rationalize the extremity of my emotions very well and find a balance in the way I act toward people without ever showing anyone what I am truly feeling. 


This makes my ""episodes"" almost unnoticeable to others, until I eventually reach my tipping point and burst, which happens quite rarely. I've been told ""this is not like you"" far too often to the point that it's become a catchphrase for others to use on me. I walk away from conflict as much as possible because I am afraid of losing control and saying things I don't want to say. So I understand why people get surprised when I speak my mind for once.

"Hello! :) from your neighbor ASD communities. So, I don't have a bipolar diagnosis (though for a while my shrinks were considering it, perhaps cyclothymia, never diagnosed though) I don't think I have bipolar disorder itself, as I don't see any of the typical patterns in me except for when I take meds like SSRI (in which case I start hallucinating, talking fast, high libido etc.) . But SSRIs malfunctioning isn't uncommon for ASD people either so IDK. 

However, there is ONE thing I realize - when I am unmedicated, and I feel exhausted due to busy life circumstances, before I know it I start doing a lot of stupid things and getting into fights, etc. My mind seems to be a little more ""all over the place"" than usual too. Particularly when the busy season is over - as if I was running full speed and then there is no road anymore and I crash. I don't know if it's an autism thing (had to get used to the busy routine, and now that it's over it's hard to go back to a normal rhythm) or if anyone with an actual bipolar disorder diagnosis experiences anything like ""hypo/mania due to exhaustion"" . It's very uncomfortable. I am back to taking CBZ so I hope it will go away in a while, but I was wondering if anyone else feels it.

"This post is just mainly sharing to the anonymous cloud, because I need a forum to collect my thoughts. Forgive me for the rambling nature. 

So I imagine many of us here have childhood trauma. Since I think bipolar disorder is both genetic and environmental. I tend to connect strongly with others that have been abused physically or mentally early in life. Sometimes itâ€™s a crazy strong connection and you donâ€™t really know what challenges they are still facing from it. I am trying me hardest not to put the cart before the horse in this new relationship thatâ€™s being formed. Since we have only hung out 5 times. I try remind myself I donâ€™t really know them. But all I want do is be around this person constantly. I feel I could get lost in them. I told them I donâ€™t want to see them for a couple days because of this and they responded they feel the same way. But we have already planned to do a multiple night trip together in a couple of weeks. 

I worry that we are so into each other is because both our last relationships were fairly abusive and in the end so unloving. So the small gestures that we have done for each other already mean way too much, because we havenâ€™t experienced someone bringing us flowers and taking us out to a nice dinner or giving us the ingredients and a the extra steamer to make the Asian dish we have always wanted to try. 

Those small things make me cry, because I have felt so unloved and not accepted for so long. Like I had to constantly be on guard and put what I want aside to avoid upsetting a person for them to be kind to me and not say mean things. 

And all I want to do is be with this person and not screw it up. Because I know my dark side can come out when I feel rejected and I hate that dark side. 

So anyway, how do you keep things in perspective and not just fall for someone instantly? Iâ€™m really trying not to get too attached and try to take it slow as possibly but when we kiss I get lightheaded and dizzy. And everything just feels so good right now. Like the day I got to spend with them was the best day Iâ€™ve had in a long time. I know Iâ€™m probably putting them on a pedestal and Iâ€™m just waiting to see their issues manifest. 

But I already feel I love this person even though I barely know them. I feel so safe with them even though I barely know them.  

So how do I stop this feeling and just take things slow?",bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™ve been doing ALOT of unnecessary research (digging into the history of my family,my religion, the church, racism, our county, social issues etc) and I think itâ€™s finally triggered a manic episode. 
Ive been on meds for about 4 years but went off on Feb because it was giving me heart palpitations. I would be sleep and wake up with my heart racing but the meds would make me sleepy so It would be hard to sleep. This became more frequent and produced anxiety attacks which scared me from sleeping so I REALLY didnâ€™t sleep and ended up just going off my meds..

Lately Iâ€™ve recognized a change in myself and itâ€™s kind of scary (I feel myself becoming more irritable, mean, spiritual, sensitive to others, driving fast, listening to a lot of music, sleeping less, having more ideas etc,) and I KNOW I NEED MEDS but I donâ€™t want to go back on the meds because they made me super unhealthy (gained weight loss 30 pounds since Iâ€™ve been off meds). 

But now.. I canâ€™t sleep. My subconscious runs wild in my sleep and Iâ€™m up every hour. It feels like Iâ€™m awake in my sleep. Iâ€™m having more nightmares. Iâ€™m tired but getting by with little to no sleep.

Mentally Iâ€™m sick. Last time I felt like this I just took some Benadryl for a couple days and told myself I need more rest and to find a therapist.

Does anyone have any holistic ways of getting some good nights rest when your having a manic episode? I donâ€™t want to have to call my psychiatrist because they will just give me another pill and Iâ€™m worried about getting a therapist because financially a good therapist is expensive. I feel bad for my partner who currently having to deal with my up and down mood swings. And physically I feel burnt out and tired.",bipolar_disorder

When someone is mad at me or I do something wrong itâ€™s never easy to forget. I stays in my clouded mind for months on end. My brain replaying ever moment of sadness. Itâ€™s where my mania starts to come into play. The image of everyone in this world hating me makes me want to lash out in anger and self harm.

I used to think a girl/boyfriend would make the pain go away, but when I graduated high school I realized how terrible that idea would be. I will be alone forever.

"Iâ€™m a 39 year old bipolar woman engaged to a wonderful man who loves, cherishes, and adores me as much as I do for him. Things are good there. Iâ€™m very lucky and Iâ€™ve gotten to where I can see that and appreciate it. He knows Iâ€™m bipolar and accepts me for it anyway. Heâ€™s an amazing guy. Iâ€™m currently on a cocktail of medication: lamictal, Rexulti, Propranalol, Wellbutrin XR, and Modafanil. I have Klonipin to take when I need it as well as hydroxine for less extreme circumstances. I only mention these things to give a complete picture. :)

Iâ€™ve been cycling through moods like someone channel surfing. Iâ€™m happy and things are good but then my fiancÃ© says something that I normally wouldnâ€™t take offense to, and Iâ€™m a huge mess in tears and completely overreacting. In the very back of my mind, I know Iâ€™m overreacting but itâ€™s like that knowledge is overridden by the emotions of that moment, if that makes sense? I get angry easily. Itâ€™s not violent anger (very rarely do I get to such a state; you have to know how to set me off). Iâ€™m not throwing things and screaming like a banshee. I just seem to take offense to every freaking thing said to me. Iâ€™m sleeping fine. If anything, sleep is a refuge for me becauseâ€¦..

My narcissistic mother has gotten to the point to where my sister and I are seriously wishing she would go into a nursing home (my mom is 70). Mom is a story in and of herself. Sheâ€™s the only who ever so graciously gave me my emotional issues (which according to her come from my father). She is a rain cloud hanging over my otherwise sunny life, pelting me with raindrops full of misery, dismay, depression, and dislike for anything that displeases her (which is about every other second). She has always been this way but never to this point. I feel like sheâ€™s draining the life from my soul and I donâ€™t know how to make it stop without telling her to F-off. 

I know Iâ€™m not the only one who has thought to themselves about the irony of being the one on medication and in therapy when it seems like someone else needs it more.

Iâ€™m going to see my psychiatrist this coming Friday, and weâ€™re leaving afterwards for a lovely weekend vacation at the beach. That following Monday, I start a great job working from home. There is a lot of good in my life right now. Thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t get where these mood swings are coming from. I canâ€™t sit still without doing something. Weâ€™re completely caught up on laundry (itâ€™s even put away which is pretty huge for me, I admit) because I canâ€™t just lounge around with my fiancÃ© and relax. The only reason Iâ€™m able to lay on our bed right now is because Iâ€™m furiously typing away on my phone.

So hereâ€™s a question that I feel I should be able to answer myself after 22 years of having a bipolar diagnosis: is it possible that the stress my mother has put upon me has induced a slight bit of hypomania? My mania is stress reactive at times so it would make sense. I just donâ€™t have the crazy racing thoughts, insomnia, and euphoria of pure mania. 

I apologize for the venting. I know my fiancÃ© loves me and he does listen to me, but he doesnâ€™t quite understand the fear of mania that other bipolar individuals have. If youâ€™ve read this far, thank you for listening. â¤ï¸",bipolar_disorder

I do have periods of depression that involve past suicide attempts. But I am not sure if these other things are mania.

An example of a previous episode that might have been mania involved me going nights without sleep. I lost my appetite too. I would eat once or twice a week. I did have periods where I was sleeping with up to 10 to 15 partners a week. I became angry and explosive on everyone around me. I suddenly quit my job.

I was like, wow, have my meds finally kicked in? But it didn't last long, fast forward to Wednesday, and that high feeling was nowhere to be found.

I just lie around all day and I really need help with getting up and moving myself around.

I havenâ€™t taken my Invega injection for over a month, with doctor supervision. We will revisit it at the next appointment. I take 10mg Fluoxetine, 15 mg of Adderall which was lowered to 10 mg last week, and smoke medical marijuana.

I was only diagnosed with bipolar after being hospitalized for psychosis. It didnâ€™t specify if it was 1 or 2.",bipolar_disorder
"I've been meaning to ask or share this before but I forgot to do it, anyway, even before I was diagnosed with Bipolar Type 1 I really had a hard time dating. Or maybe it's just because of my poor decision making or me being impulsive. So last year, I met a guy, he was nice at first and I thought maybe he's ""the one"" or I may have convinced myself to just whatever let's take a chance and see where this thing will go. And so I tried dating him, I didn't commit to him yet because I'm still not sure if I really want to.

But he insisted that we commit now to a serious relationship and maybe get married next year (which was supposedly this year) but I got so overwhelmed that he is rushing things, I am also a single mom to a 6 year old boy and he hadn't met my son but he's already trying to make decisions on my behalf. Anyways, in those 11 months that I am talking to him everyday I am triggered to get angry or to go on a rage. I am taking my medicines diligently but the slightest thing can set me on a rage and pick a fight with him. And I started harming myself and be destructive, it first started with punching my laptop, throwing my phone, punching the wall, then destroyed my eyeglasses, pull out a lot of hair, tried to strangle my neck which gave me bruises that I had to hide from my family, then punched my left leg until it turned black and blue from the bruises then the right leg next, I hear voices telling me to harm my sister and my son, or to harm other people which I never experienced in the past and the last one was breaking a glass cup on my head which gave me 2 stitches and 5 stitches on my pinky finger. I was afraid to leave him at first because he's always saying that he'll die if I do, or whenever we're fighting he'll say that he can breathe and when I ask him what does he want he'll say that committing to him will make him better and I felt so guilty that I just go on with it even if I was on a depressive episode every day. But last month, I finally had enough and I finally cut ties with him and so far right now, I haven't had any episode where I would want to harm myself or even think about it. I don't know but I just realized that there are really people that are bad for our mental health and we should have the courage to cut them off. I just have to get this out of my chest.

"Depression is a disease that is inverse to nature. It asks you to plunge into the darkness when you want to see the light. It makes you hate yourself when all you want is peace. It forces you to abandon the pursuit of happiness in trade of self-destruction. It keeps you down when all you want to be is up. And it screams to kill yourself against our inner nature to survive. 

Recognizing the absurdity of depression can be the first step forward in recovering.

Progress starts with small victories. When depression tells you to give up, fight back. Take a shower. Clean your place. See your friends and family. Most importantly, survive. 

Weâ€™re all in this together â€” hereâ€™s to the small victories. â¤ï¸",bipolar_disorder

My mother (BP 2) was really depressive after a covid infection and her psychiatrist prescribed an antidepressant. It fixed her mood for 3 weeks (maybe a little bit caused hipomania too) but now this week she is in depressive mode again.

Now that sheâ€™s gone, I fear for the times I will be home alone not liking anything I watch or listen to. I get panicked and feel abandoned. I realize how sad this is since Iâ€™m an adult and shouldnâ€™t need my mom anymore, but Iâ€™ve said yes to all of her invites and have forgotten how to be alone.

"Hey yâ€™all. 

Not sure where to begin. But, long story short, I met someone three months ago and began a relationship about a month ago. It has been great fun. I enjoy her deeply and see her as the type of person I could fall in love with. 

But. 

She is simply not well. After some time she shared that she is both actively suicidal and battling an eating disorder. She is not in medication nor is she seeing a therapist with any regularity. 

Money is the barrier here, rather than desire, but sheâ€™s also chosen to arrange her life to study abroad in the coming months (meaning she chose that as more important to spend on than seeking help to recover). 

Anyway. 

Much of our time is spent with me nursing her moods. Iâ€™m quite good at it, Iâ€™ve been suicidal myself and am quite empathetic, but I can already tell that long term with someone in her headspace would drain me. 

Iâ€™m in the head space where Iâ€™m ready to find my person settle down and do the marriage thing. Sheâ€™s actively interested in dying. Thatâ€™s no place to start a long lasting relationshipâ€¦ right?

How do you know if the meds are working or if you are just naturally coming out of an episode?

I will also add there was psychosis in this depressive episode as well.  I eventually came out of that episode and was stable for quite some time. 

Since this illness is nuerodigenerative though, my episodes have become a lot longer and still zero response from the medication. My back is now seized up due to Zyprexa and I have Covid as well. Honestly? I hope the Covid takes me out. Back on Trileptal because hey I tolerated it well but never found stability.

"I was diagnosed bipolar about 4 years ago. My aunt on my mothers side is bipolar and my father is also diagnosed with bipolar. Ever since I have been on my medication, trileptal, I had been doing a lot better. Still struggling, but better. 

My fiancÃ© and I (he is an absolutely wonderful man) were trying for our first child. I am 28 and he is 29. I had never been pregnant before. On March 31 I texted positive for being pregnant. I was over the moon. I immediately met with my psychiatrist who told me to stop taking my trileptal cold Turkey and said he â€œhopes nothing has already happened to the babyâ€ since trileptal is not proven safe for pregnancy. 

On April 6 I called my doctor due to some spotting and was directed to the ER. That day, I was diagnosed with a â€œcomplete miscarriageâ€ by the doctor. I was an absolute wreck. Screaming and crying in the parking lot. I thought spotting in early pregnancy was normal. 

3 days later I returned to see my OBGYN. After speaking with me and taking my blood, they concluded they I was only in early pregnancy and thatâ€™s why my HCG levels were so low. I was told I did not have a miscarriage and my levels were rising, and to return in a few days. 

On April 13 I received a call from the OBGYN office. They said if I had any cramping or bleeding whatsoever, to go to the ER. Almost immediately after the call, I began experiencing the worst pain in my right side Iâ€™ve ever had. 

I rushed home from work and my fiancÃ© took me to the ER. The pain was so sharp I began to throw up and cry and scream during the short ride. Once at the ER, I was given the usual tests again along with ultrasounds. 

I was told I was experiencing an ectopic pregnancy and needed to get a methotrexate treatment immediately so that my tube did not burst. The next day, I was sent to another ER to finally terminate my pregnancy. I was reassured this is all completely normal and not my fault and thereâ€™s nothing that I did wrong. 

After the treatment I was pushed into a miscarriage where I was extremely physically ill for weeks. Going to the bathroom was an absolute nightmare. I do not want to go into too much detail here in the physical things I experienced, but I do feel traumatized. Emotionally I was an absolute wreck. I truly believe I probably should I checked myself in to an inpatient which would have been my first time, but I wanted to stay strong. I cried and cried and laid here for days. I couldnâ€™t move. 

I was told by a nurse that my psychiatrist should have weened me off of my trileptal. Mind you, I experienced all of this while not taking my medication. 

After all of this I returned to get back on my trileptal and was also given 20mg Prozac. 

I owe thousands of dollars in medical bills. Each of my copays for the ERâ€™s are 1100$. I donâ€™t even know how much I owe in total and they have been calling me and emailing me since 2 weeks after my treatment. 

I feel like a zombie. I am able to get things done like go to work, clean, eat, normal human things. No sex drive, no feelings, no will to talk to my family or friends. Emotionless. I can typically cry very easy but now I canâ€™t at all. I donâ€™t feel sad or mad or happy. Just nothingness. Itâ€™s like a part of me left when my baby left.

"So, Aside from blowing up a 4 year relationship in my mania, the lows have been what has predominantly stifled my life, (I can even attribute the source of that end of one of my Luvâ€™s to her perceived laziness of me) But the lows are the foundation which has formulated all types of bad habits that turned into coping mechanisms. I call them my endorphin buttons. I am Definitely not lazy, the mania brings out my ambition for sure but the long crash after acts like a reset for it all. I was diagnosed Bi-Polar in my late 20â€™s and Iâ€™m lucky that my career up till now is extremely flexible and I networked myself and put myself in a position to succeed, and yet I havenâ€™t. Financially Iâ€™m pretty far back, my goals havenâ€™t been reached and I just keep procrastinating. even as a write this Iâ€™m procrastinating. Iâ€™ll admit I lost all my ambition for a few years when I was diagnosed. I could at least put a â€œwhyâ€ behind my patterns. So I figured, â€œfuck itâ€ I know my tendencies just let it all go for a while and be ok with existing and figure out how to deal with my being. Fast forward after a few years. Medication took away the constant brain fog till 3pm and I started to feel like I wanted to put more on my plate only this time I knew not to put it all on myself. I got better at â€œmentallyâ€ delegating. 
Basically I knew who I could bring on board to help me out instead of wanting to do everything myself like the perfectionist my head wants. 

So many services exist to streamline process and Iâ€™m all about finding ways to â€œMin-Maxâ€.

2020 was actually a huge gift in time for me that felt squandered. So many ppl I knew were out of work and thirsty for a project and I had it all in my head ready to make my project happenâ€¦

And I didnâ€™t. 

I figured I had way more time and got lost in bad habits instead. I recently looked up different types of procrastination and I do all of them. It sucks. I tell myself Iâ€™m about to do something and I donâ€™t do it. It gets put off to the next day a week later Iâ€™ve lost all time from that week and I go wtf I was doing something that someone on YouTube set up in 5 hours and Iâ€™m not even done, 1 and a half months later. I donâ€™t even have a 9-5 job right now. I literally take work when I want and can actually make a live able wage working half as much as most ppl partly because Iâ€™ve avoided all responsibilities in my life. I could get a normal job but It would only be for a routine and I kind of think itâ€™s a dumb way to go about it when I can just pick up more work in my field. Iâ€™ve left 3 consecutive places because family and friends enabled me to get away from even more responsibilities. Or at least that was my reasoning for a little while. (Side note: seriously I thank my lucky stars and am blessed by the grace of fucking god for these people and I am grateful, Iâ€™d rather pick up a spare bedroom and cover ppls bills then pay some asshole or management company a fucking dime, just clean up after yourself and make dinner for ppl and â€œmostâ€ is forgiven) but Iâ€™ve squandered my time and itâ€™s embarrassing. I donâ€™t know where my life has gone. Granted I have some awesome stories and have lived a life so far that when I am not in this hole is pretty rad and I want to be that person all the time. But like what the fuck man. This procrastination shit is like the bane of my existence. Itâ€™s eaten up so much of my life that the weeks that went by werenâ€™t weeks, they were months that added up into years.  Literally when I sit down anything that agitates me more than 30mins I walk away and donâ€™t pick it up for another 3 hours come back it pisses me off for 10 minutes and I leave it for a day only to find out after someone shows me that I was uploading a file in the wrong spot, or  changed a setting by mistake that fucks with an entire process. Also it takes me longer to do regular tasks even when I am focused. 

Last month I procrastinated so bad that the thing Iâ€™m going to do today I start at 1am and had to pass out at 7am the next day. Itâ€™s like I decided to give up on that day but change time zones in my sleep schedule to be ahead the next day. My sleep schedule was fucked for 3 weeks. 

Sleep is one of if not the most important thing to do. Way to go me. 

Iâ€™ve heard everything too. You need a schedule, remove distractions, eat healthy, work out. I fucking tell ppl this and yet itâ€™s so fucking hard to stay consistent with it. I swear I fucking try and I still am trying. (Enter Yoda telling me there is no try only do or do not. little green Grover motherfucker)  God fucking help me if I have some random idiot hear me vent and say â€œjust take it easyâ€ because thatâ€™s
Alcohol of my addiction, thanks Guy.  Iâ€™m not giving up but fuck me, WHY CANâ€™T I JUST FINISH like so many others I know who can grind till itâ€™s done. I hate these fucking lows. They tap me the fuck out when I get into routines. Now, here I am staring at squandered resources forced to make hard decisions I wouldnâ€™t have to had I just fucking finished 1 or 2 of the projects that would have got me just so much farther. I wouldnâ€™t even be so angry right now if they failed, at least theyâ€™d be done. Hell I know I could even be a fucking millionaire. Although Iâ€™d stop at figuring out the formula for 6 figures doing the bare minimum and continue my lifeâ€™s goal of being my own version of Indiana Jones. Donâ€™t get me wrong. In my mind if I needed to grind 6 years of my life to get there in the 1st place I would or at least would have mentally. But guess what 10 years went by,â€¦well fuck me sideways and those â€œnewâ€ health problems ppl bitch about when they arenâ€™t in their 20â€™s anymore. 

Everyday is a new day, recognize your faults and mitigate the procrastination, avoid my pitfalls. The minimum is good enough compared to putting it off till never because perfection is the enemy progress. And with the bare minimum At least then there is something to come back to. 

Get into â€œthe routineâ€ and when it falls apart. Eat it and do it again. What else?? See someone so they can tell me what I embarrassingly already know. Fuck these lows and the shit habits they helped me cultivate. Iâ€™m actually at a point to where I feel like I need to take extreme measures to break this shit. Oh yeah, donâ€™t berate yourself kids. It doesnâ€™t help. 

Look, I know itâ€™s doable. I wonâ€™t give up. Literally I think I need to hold myself at gunpoint. 

TL/DR

Iâ€™m venting. Lows are a breeding grounds for bad habits, Iâ€™m recognizing how terribly bad they are later on in my life. Find anyway you can to mitigate them.  They keep popping up even when Iâ€™m in good routines and I let them win. Easy Dopamine is one helluva drug. No, I donâ€™t give up and that isnâ€™t supposed to be some inspirational bullshit. It just means Iâ€™m stubborn. 

Also please Donâ€™t feel sorry for my bad habits literally Iâ€™m a grown ass stubborn man just making bad choices of inaction at this point in my life to where Iâ€™m dealing with consequences of my own doing. Iâ€™m literally on a journey at this point to find as many dopamine detox methods as I can and hope that acts as a reset and not a purge to the binge.

"Anyone else here also out of work because of their bipolar and feel *really disproportionately bad about it?*

I don't know how common it is for other bipolar folks to not be able to work, but I'm 22 and have only held a job for 6 months.... 4 years ago. There are other factors, but to be honest, I don't think I'd be able to keep one down even if I had all the tools to do so. Anyone have any advice or wise words for me? I feel like I'm getting better in nearly every other way since being medicated, but this is still something I struggle with and feel really bad about. 

Like... Do I need to get over it? Am I just lazy? Am I ever going to be valued in this society? Will it get better once there's no other obstacles? Would it improve if I worked a job involving a passion, or would it steer me away from enjoying it independently?

"Ive been recently diagnosed with adhd and gad and i am currently on my third day of taking an snri. I suspect that I do indeed have bipolar disorder and my doctor confirmed that what I went through in the summer of 2020 was sebere depression following mania. Currently I feel an elivated mood, I have a loss of appetite and decreased need for sleep, today I slept st 3 am and woke up at 5 and I have a small sense that I want to do something impulsive like spending, sex, drugs or start fights. Is this something to be worried about? Should I contact my doctor? I havent been formally diagnosed but as my doctor said its bery hard to disgnose bipolar in teens, and my adhd and gad diagnosis makes it even harder because the conditions have similar traits. I'm scared of the anti depressants spiriling me into a horrible cycle like the one I had back then.

So are these warning signs of mania? Or am I overreacting and being a bit paranoid?",bipolar_disorder

"So I got invited to stay at a resort as a part of a marketing promotion for a resort. Free two nights, and all I had to do was sit through a sales pitch about vacation ownership shares. Went in thinking I wasnâ€™t going to buy one, but the sales guy was really cool and actually was upfront about everything. They gave me a great deal and the property only costs about 10k, I had to put down a $1400 deposit down on it (I had 11k in my savings no biggie Iâ€™ll have the money back in two months) I am medicated, no worries and my meds work great! I did miss my medication the night before buying this but I actually did have second thoughts while doing the paperwork, the salesman told me Iâ€™m not obligated to join anything he doesnâ€™t want me to do anything I donâ€™t feel comfortable with. I decided to do it. This is my first real estate purchase, so I have an investment, plus I can now take a vacation anywhere in the world for only $259 a week instead of paying over a thousand for a hotel room, the property trading company pays for my hotels. They also give you 20% discounts on flights, restaurants, stores and even rentals. Yes, there is maintenance fees. Itâ€™s only $465 a year right now and it only goes up a few pennies a year at this company. Worse case scenario I can always just sell if it doesnâ€™t work out. I think I made a good decision and I will get to see the world now like Iâ€™ve always dreamed to. I wouldnâ€™t have done this is if it was a crazy amount, my original offer was a $4k deposit on a $28,000 property and I said, Iâ€™m interested but Iâ€™m not financially comfortable with that much and they totally understood! I remember at the table freaking out like â€œoh god is this just another manic impulse buyâ€ but I think I actually just did an adult thing today and bought some property. I already have great credit but Iâ€™m worried the fact Iâ€™ve fallen behind on my therapy bills has caused my credit to drop. The company told me once I start making mortgage payments I can call them every three months to report to the credit bureaus and it will boost my credit! The salesman started in construction and owns property with the company and he said his credit has gone up hundreds since his investment started. Another upside is that I can also rent out vacations to other people for side income. Say I ask someone to give me a couple hundred to a few grand depending on what their trip would cost, and then I book them a trip through my company. Sorry for the long rant but I just wanted to share my story with people who understand what itâ€™s like to question investments. Normally when Iâ€™m manic Iâ€™ll buy dumb pointless shit like sports cars, and subwoofers, but this time doesnâ€™t feel like mania.

"About two years back I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but since Iâ€™ve become independent from my parents and moved out, Iâ€™ve stopped taking meds and kinda forgot about it till I started to reflect on my lifestyle n why I seemed to swing back and forth between a wired party/show goer who sleeps every other night for a week to going back to my normal empty feeling self. 

Long story short I think I have Cyclothymia (shorter phases with less intense lows). It seems really similar but not as severe as full blown manic and depressive episodes. 

Anyway I was thinking. Doctors these days are kinda just salesman for pharmacies and given that Google says bipolar disorder is â€œvery commonâ€ with over 3 mil cases per year, it begs the question of how accurate diagnoses are. I would expect the diagnoses with less severe symptoms to be more common no?

\- Memory very impacted. I keep losing my car keys as an example. I have often bended down to pick up a bag and forgotten I had my car keys in my hand and dropped them in the bag when I pick it up.

\- Sometimes when I speak I use incorrect grammar and only realize after I have said it e.g. 'she think that' instead of 'she thinks \[s added\] that'.

"My first diagnosis is bipolar 2

My previous meds (lithium zeldox) did not work so my doc changed another meds, carbamazepine.

At first week of carbamazepine, I experienced extreme sleepiness, extreme dizziness, trouble walking on flat ground

At second week of carbamazepine, I experienced too much dizzness, and visual hallucination. When I went outta home, I saw things that do not exist for like 2-3 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

I got very very paranoid and scared. I could not get out of my room and I googled sideffect like literally  every hour.

So, I searched several websites: 

first, my country's fda website 

second, med manufacturer pamphlet 

third, emc website

fourth, fda website

These four sources said that hallucination and dizzinesss are rare sideffects.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite of reading them, I was still very nervous and paranoid and scared. So I called my hospital.

Doc said ""just completely cut off carbamazepine and we will see you three weeks after."" 

So I followed exactly what my doc told me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Starting evening of November 3, I just completely stopped this med. Pharmacist said it takes 4 - 6 days for the meds to completely get outta my body. I have been waiting everyday. 

November 3 I experienced visual halluicnation. And the same goes for November 4 and 5 were the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Worried I might hallucinate again, I did not leave  my house at all today. I have been thinking all day whether my diagnosis will change to schizoaffective  / schizophrenia.  

I am still in confusion and the only thing I rely on at the moment is my doc's appointment three weeks later.

"Hey Bipo-Folk.

I'm not sure if this is exactly the right place, but I kinda would like some input from people who also have one or the other diagnosis. To see if you've been in this situation before....and some insight into whether or not I'm just being too sensitive. I have PTSD (due to three major events....but especially one of those - the worst one - would no doubt be a bit too triggering to write out), Bipolar Disorder and ADHD. 

So I recently fell out with a close friend of mine. We first were talking about it via WhatsApp. But eventually, we met up to talk about it in person. This was a week ago and I'm still rather hung up on something she said. 

The issue was that I have difficulty with relationship constancy and as a result, I am often unsure of the relationship between myself and others. I am also hypervigilant when it comes to changes in communication. For example, changes in tone or posture. And that's exactly what she used against me. She said I couldn't notice such things and that I had already said that I sometimes react somewhat paranoid. The issue of paranoia was something I was told last year during a hospital stay. However, I now know that it is not paranoia, but hypervigilance. She didn't (or couldn't) understand that.

The fact that she had even brought the subject of paranoia into the conversation feels to me like she is not only using things I have told her in confidence against me but also my diagnoses and difficulties. 

So....question...am I being paranoid or is that crossing a line. To me, it feels like she crossed a line. But I don't want to go and further fuel the conflict without proper cause.

"Not looking for a diagnosis but explaining what might be the biggest revelation that I just made about my latest falter. 

Note: I also have a history of substance abuse; specifically a three week binge in college I was introduced to Xanax by my roommate and I started popped them like candy. Did Xanax and frequently drank alcohol while on it. During this time had an intervention from my close friends and family where I was able to stop cold Turkey. Graduated college and have been working as a professional for the last 10 years. 

However since that episode Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with GAD and social anxiety and ADD. I currently see a medical provider who oversees my treatment. About 2-3 weeks before this vacation we decide to change my SSRI medication to Vilazodone with a dose increase a week prior to leaving. 


Anyways I met a guy down there off of tinder  who happened to have some Xanax and we went out together that night and offered me some. I said fuck it (which is so stupid to think about it cause we were out already drinking). I remember bits and pieces of literally the entire trip. I was popping Xanax like candy and drinking all day everyday. I usually have no sex drive because of my antidepressant but I think with the recent switch and dose increase of starting a new one; plus all of the damn substances I was on (several different drugs and was drinking constantly). I ended up having an insane amount of sex with multiple different guys who I met through dating apps and/or just while going out to the local bars which were all walking distance from my Airbnb. Now Iâ€™m literally the opposite of this as Iâ€™m very shy and reserved and usually am not one to be so careless but the benzos/alcoho combo is Literally the WORST and Iâ€™m sure everybody could tell I was fucked up. 

Anyways, I overspent money (thankfully I had budget for this trip in the event that emergencies happened so Iâ€™m okay there) had lots of random sex, did a lot of fucking drugs and drank like crazy and posted a lot of embarrassing shit. I missed my flight home, my wallet ended up getting stolen, lost my Apple watch, my AirPods, and my new $200 sunglasses I just bought for this trip. I stopped the drugs once I realized I was legitimately in a dangerous situation walking around Mexico without a fucking clue of where I was going. I got rid of whatever stash or shit I had on me and spent the night in the airport and booked the next flight home. Im embarrassed as fuck and disappointed and worried a lot of people  who constantly tried to FaceTime me and call me to make sure I was at least alive. 


Since being back im now just wondering if this all stemmed from a drug relapse addiction/substance abuse problem where  I was literally out of my fucking mindâ€¦. Or if that SSRI that I had just started and increased the dosage somehow was the catalyst to an episode of mania??? 

TLDR: Not diagnosed with bipolar or even with a hx of depression but I newly switched SSRIs which I take for anxiety. Also have a Hx of substance abuse/addiction. Went on vacation and was offered Xanax. Ended up on a 10 day bender of constant drug use, drinking, sex, I even got invited to sex parties and did more drugs, overspent money which isnâ€™t really new for me, missed my flight home and scared a lot of good people. I donâ€™t really remember much because of the drug combo and I do not know if I just relapsed from my addiction or if this is considered a manic episode. Again not looking for a diagnosis I am already seeing a mental health professional about this this week, but man what the fuck did I just do?!

"I forgot I had Reddit as a tool to get feedback until now and Iâ€™ve been stuck with a question I canâ€™t answer myself. 
So first off, I have the BPD/bipolar womb combo and am almost certain Iâ€™m manic and get irresponsibly stoned most of my day. A little under a year ago I had a whole horrific bpd break up horror show. I tried to kms what ever I failed on purpose and after I did that I realized that I really am not going to do anything and I canâ€™t just live like this all the time so I started taking time to properly work through the thoughts instead of just shoving them away and it all evolved from there. Around this time I started smoking weed as well. Once I moved out of my exâ€™s I gained a hobby of just staring at my walls constantly doing work inside of myself with an open mind. I still spend time on stuff I enjoy but when a thought comes up I take the time of day to think through it. I started learning about psychology Meditation and philosophy (during a manic hyper focus) and Iâ€™ve taken it all in. Iâ€™ve worked through various traumas making peace with my past bringing back repressed memories Iâ€™ve become so much more aware of splitting and catching bpd thoughts out of the â€œrealâ€ ones. Iâ€™m friends with my ex now believe it or not and even though my bpd is still very much attached to him it just feels like a test of strength to me so I can endure less later on. Each time Iâ€™ve had a depressive episode I use it as a time to learn more about my thought patterns and same with mania. These thoughts have the manic glimmer but Iâ€™m not sure if I just canâ€™t recognize hope. The other side to it is I spent a lot of time thinking instead of doing things that I should be spending my renewed life on but also Iâ€™m doing the work rn so I can enjoy life later since Iâ€™m like not cured just because I know a lot. If I say itâ€™s mania then that stuff wouldnâ€™t be true and Iâ€™m just lying to myself but if I canâ€™t say itâ€™s not because thatâ€™s what a manic person would say.

You want to sit and eat crepes all day and sip wine and wonder what it would be like to climb the Eifel Tower. It is your mission now, to move away. To become someone else.....anyone else. Time slows down to a screeching halt. The conversation ends and you feel empty. Everything is quiet. You listen to the trees blow in the wind. They are speaking in soft tones. The house is cold.

I want to say it gets better from here but it doesn't. Somehow the bottle of vodka has made its way next to you, but you don't quite remember grabbing it out of your ""Last resort"" cabinet. How many sips have you had....? Three? Five? It doesn't matter. Just keep going. Keep going until the noise stops. Until everything is quiet. You just want to stop thinking about everything, even things that don't seem relevant to what is going on around you, like why the laptop makes that weird loud humming sound, and why your face turns bright red when you drink, and what was I going to have for dinner tonight? The world turns hazy, like those cheap fog machines that people use on Halloween. Things multiply and your lips have started tingling. There's nothing left to do now except to curl into a ball in the bed and force your eyes shut tight, and pray that tomorrow this will all have been but a dream.",bipolar_disorder
"I've never been diagnosed with ADHD, but prior to my diagnosis, I had every symptom for it under the sun. My bipolar medication alleviates every single one of those symptoms. I feel like a different person. When I was first told I had to take medication every day, I was in terror. I could never remember to take something, even antibiotics. But once I'm on meds, I can stay on them. I haven't missed a single dose. Do you remember to take yours?",bipolar_disorder
"(F, 25, BPII) I always wonder if Iâ€™m on ~too~ many medications and thatâ€™s why I still donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m stable. I take Atenolol, Lexapro, Lamictal, and Rexulti every day, and Ativan as needed (and has been needed more frequently as of late).

I also really donâ€™t think I know what good and stable should be for me. My baseline is typically always â€œmehâ€ butâ€¦ that doesnâ€™t sound like a mentally healthy baseline to me. 

Iâ€™m a licensed mental health professional in a school building working with elementary kids. Itâ€™s tanking my mental health, but these needy friends are crying for help and this is my life passion. Quitting my job is not an option, and something my psychologist says we will continue to discuss over and over because they know I am incredibly stubborn. 

Iâ€™m working very closely with my psych and medication provider (who also work closely together in the same office). Theyâ€™ve mentioned Ketamine treatments if we all feel itâ€™s getting resistant, but canâ€™t help but wonder if Iâ€™m correct and all the meds are making me stunt progress. Either that, or Iâ€™m about to dip down and spiral with my moods because Iâ€™m starting to think Iâ€™m going to â€œfind myselfâ€ by reasoning my way out of meds. 

I donâ€™t really have a question but would love to hear from anyone reading this, and maybe just reassurance in which direction my foggy mind is trying to take me against my will.",bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™ve been on lithium for 2 years now. Iâ€™m currently taking 1200mg at night. It has worked wonders and really helped with my mania. I have the typical side effects, dry mouth, mild tremor, and thirst. The only issue I have with it is the chronic diarrhea! Ever since my dose was increase last year I canâ€™t get through a meal, work day or anything without running for the bathroom multiple times. I also wake up several times a night with diarrhea. I thought something was wrong with my gut and spent a lot of time seeing my PCP this past year until recently when my psychiatrist disclosed she thinks itâ€™s from the lithium. She was aware of my diarrhea btw. Additionally my uric acid has been elevated since the dose increase. Iâ€™m pretty sure the lithium increase has something to do with it. Has anyone had any experiences with elevated uric acid? 
Why am I thinking of adding lamictal one so I can reduce my lithium dose and 2 so Iâ€™m not Tim Burton character depressed. My depression has not improve and Iâ€™m tired of feeling like I filled flesh sack. Also when I was on this medication it was a god send for my depression but not my mania
Would you recommend this combo? How was your depression and mania? Have you notice less diarrhea being on a lower lithium dose. Have a lower lithium dose affected you mania?",bipolar_disorder
"Recently met a fellow bipole over the internet (not here). We instantly clicked in a way I never have with another person. Our senses of humor lined up perfectly and the banter was just fantastic. We came to find out we were also very sexually compatible, as well, which was just the icing on the cake. I knew it was the codependency talking, but I'd finally found ""my person"".

Last night, she told me she'd been having to stop herself from saying she loved me for a while. I hadn't thought it was that way for her, but apparently the feelings were quite mutual. Last night, we decided to become an item, officially, and set down some ground rules. I was very happy. It just felt right.

Then she didn't really talk to me much today. She usually talks to me a lot during the day, but I assumed she was busy and gave her space. Then, a few hours ago, she texted and said someone had made an Instagram account using pictures of her and she was scared and I did my best to comfort her. About an hour ago, I went to check our messages, and all of hers were deleted and I was blocked.

I'm not sure if she suspected I had done it or if it was a story and she just got cold feet. Maybe she'd been manic and came to and realized she wasn't so interested and couldn't think of a way to let me down gently. I don't know, but I'm honestly crushed. Sometimes it really feels like there's a supernatural force conspiring to keep me unhappy.

I don't know why I'm sharing this, but I feel so fucked up and just needed to let this out.",bipolar_disorder

(tbf i think i feel less sleepy and more like i wanna void life as a big reason as to why i sleep) and then iâ€™ll go back to either mania or hypo mania

"Im just at a loss because I want to support her, but I donâ€™t know how to build our relationship up to a place where we can. I went through some things, and was eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders. Iâ€™m obviously not perfect but I can manage myself a lot better now. We are ok good terms, hang out regularly, etc. but I am not close with her, and I donâ€™t think sheâ€™s close with anyone enough to the point where she would open up. 

In May 2020, my dad left my mom. Over the past two years, I came to realize  heâ€™s not a great role model. Heâ€™s one of those guys who has a troubled childhood life and I think something bad happened to him. Itâ€™s obvious he loves my siblings and I, but he definitely has some sociopathic tendencies (in one example, heâ€™s idea of a relationship with us is very surface level. He just buys us things.). Heâ€™s not dangerous or anything, but heâ€™s made it clear that ultimately heâ€™s out for himself. My mom is sort a happy-go-lucky type who, although is the sweetest woman youâ€™ll ever meet, is very childlike and I canâ€™t rely on her to be a proper parent either sadly. 

I took him leaving my mom pretty hard even though I was 21 at the time and had a few manic outbursts.  My youngest sister took it hard too. She was 12 the time he left (and I donâ€™t think sheâ€™s had mania yet but I still really sense she may have the disorder). Heâ€™s never made an effort to be properly present in her life (though I argue with him to no end on how we have different definitions on how a parent should be there for their children). It was a drastic change in her style right away. She was very girly, very attentive to animals, loved Disney, princesses, etc before. A typical girly-girl, a little spoiled, but had a great heart. She started getting into that more dark style. Her hair first went to a cool Joan Jett cut, but she now has a more 80s menâ€™s heartthrob style and wears a lot of menâ€™s clothing. She looks insanely cool, and does it well, but itâ€™s pretty obvious itâ€™s stems from depression. I donâ€™t think sheâ€™s a different gender or identifies a different way too (sheâ€™s been asked and has said thatâ€™s not the case). If anything, I think sheâ€™s hiding from her â€œfemininityâ€ because of what my dad did. I could be wrong but I even asked my psychologist this once and he said that is a possibility. Obviously I would support her in anything. The fact this change came about during a traumatic situation and very suddenly with no signs before is why I am cautious though. I can guarantee I wouldâ€™ve donâ€™t the same thing if I was her age when my dad left. Her and I are super alike, even in looks. People think sheâ€™s my twin sometimes!

I found out she cuts herself. I also notice she looks at dark things on the internet. I did the same thing at her age, but my difference was I was very vocal about wanting help. She hasnâ€™t opened up and has not been receptive to anyones  attempts to help or support her. I was suicidal and sadly attempted quite a few times. Again though, I as vocal and always got help. She scares me. Sheâ€™d be the type to just do something without a word beforehand.  I think she may have bipolar too.  She has the same night terrors I started to have at the same time. I know for myself my mania didnâ€™t present itself until I started abusing my prescription drugs. Sheâ€™s currently not on anything. Obviously I canâ€™t diagnose anyone, but Iâ€™m really worried. Sure I have suffered, but I donâ€™t want that for anyone else, especially my sweet sister. 

What can I do to help? My bf is going to take her to the gym since heâ€™s super into lifting and he can give her routines, and thatâ€™s something sheâ€™s expressed interest in. We all want to get her to a counsellor but sheâ€™s not in that spot right now. Obviously you canâ€™t push someone. Iâ€™ve always been the one needing support, but now I want to step up and carry it forward. What can I do?",bipolar_disorder

"Been this way as long as I can remember. I never knew it was bipolar but eventually got diagnosed. I find it almost impossible to maintain friendships. I struggle to stay working but my wife and daughter need me to. I exist in a waling nightmare out of need to support others when I, myself, desprately what to die. I am trapped.

I work around people and some days Im fine. Ive actually been told Im really witty and funny when Im normal. Often Im depressed and I know everything coming out of my mouth sounds negative but it feels impossible to sound positive.

Then other days I am just either anxious out of my mind, hypomanic or flat. When flat I cannot think of anything funny to say to save my life so just end up responding with logical, rational things that have no real substance but always without a hint of humor. 

The people Im around eventually think Im dismissing them when they make jokes to get me talking and I can not respond in turn. What's worse is on my normal or manic days I have a never ending stream of jokes if I want them so when the depression happens they really think Im just dismissing them. Lol...it seems ironic to me in a morbid way.


 And...yep there goes another friend. And when the depression hits it's hard to talk, hard to think even to the point of slurring my words. Sometimes I cant hear what people are saying even when they are talking right in front of me. I know they are talking but it just sounds like gibberish or muffled. 


The sad thing is Im actually pretty smart. Sorry if that sounds arrogant. I only mention it because I know without a doubt if I didnt have this my life would be so different. No money troubles, friends and just a good life. But the longer I go on the more I realize that's never going to happen. 

I wrote this because Ive never actually felt like I could talk this way with anyone. Ever.

I'm a man drowning with a fake smile on my face so I dont have to hear questions like ""what is wrong"" all the time. To which there is no answer that would ever suffice.

My life has truly changed for the better since Iâ€™ve started medications and Iâ€™m very proud of my personal progress. I donâ€™t plan of ever stopping my meds!

So itâ€™s been about 6 months of dealing with my bipolar diagnosis, and Iâ€™m struggling big time to work through the depression.

It makes me emotional (lol) to look back on myself when I was a little younger, at the start of my 5 year relationship and how happy I was. I feel like at this point I owe it to myself and my very loving and kind partner, whoâ€™s stuck with me through EVERYTHING Iâ€™ve put him through, to be better. 

Iâ€™m starting by not smoking weed anymore - it was a daily before bed habit for me and thatâ€™s step one. My next step is to have a solid, same-time-every-night bed time. What else can I do? I know this is something I live with now, but Iâ€™m so tired of wallowing in my depression. Itâ€™s so hard to get out of and so easy to sit in. I have accepted that depression will be apart of my life as itâ€™s one portion of my mental illness, but the crankiness and bad feelings hanging over my head for days is getting old.

"So I (22m) have been struggling with BPD for two years now (probably longer but thatâ€™s when I was diagnosed). Iâ€™ve been put into a psych ward twice and had severe episodes that have ruined relationships with friends and romantic partners. I became incredibly addicted to alcohol and weed and would often use it as a coping mechanism. 

Long story short, I kept going from medication to medication and from therapy to therapy. They would change my meds, alter the dosage, but nothing seemed to ever be working. In fact, I would feel terrible on a lot of the meds they gave me. I didnâ€™t feel like myself. I felt as though I was trapped in some sort of weird dream state. I started losing enjoyment in a lot of things I liked to do and, worst of all, started losing my ambition. I became complacent in a lot of things. 

Eventually I had enough and stopped taking my medication for two months (a super dangerous and stupid move I know). I just wanted to feel normal again. I wanted to feel like my old self. It worked for a while too until I eventually had a terrible episode, ending with me sobbing in the closet of my workplace, unable to move. 

This was the point where I desperately started searching for solutions. I became paranoid though since my trust in pharmaceutical companies and medication had been tainted. Eventually, I came across an article talking about Lithium pills, a seemingly â€œall naturalâ€ mood stabilizer. After listening to a few podcasts and doing some more readings, I eventually took the plunge and requested lithium. Itâ€™s not a crazy high dosage and itâ€™s not 100% lithium, but itâ€™s the thing that I felt the most comfortable taking. 

So far, itâ€™s been an amazing experience. My mood has genuinely felt stable and I lot of the awful, spontaneous tantrums I would throw have been a thing of the past. I find myself thinking through scenarios a lot more and not just acting on impulse all the time. I feel a lot calmer and a lot more at peace. The best part is, I still feel like myself.

"Hi, I have had bipolar II since I was 14 (for 18 years) and have never taken any medication for it. I have no thoughts of harming myself or others and usually my symptoms are bearable with a good support network, healthy eating, exercise, and a history of good therapists. I am in my first trimester of pregnancy with my third child. 

I have been feeling panic and claustrophobia since I became pregnant and my doctor wants me to see a psychiatrist, but I am afraid of possible medication side effects (suicide thoughts, life threatening rash, loss of sex drive, weight gain, the list goes on and on), and Iâ€™m afraid that medicine will just make me worse in this unstable period that is pregnancy. 

Should I see a psychiatrist or should I cancel my appointment and continue without medication, since Iâ€™ve been pretty alright for 18 years without?",bipolar_disorder

"Hi everyone! I recently decided to lay off alcohol after a three month long period of binge drinking following the death of my grandmother. I'm in school full time, making straight A's, living alone with my dog and paying all of the bills myself. 
I took about 2 months off of work after my grandmother passed (she was almost like a mother) and I blew through my savings and put myself in a situation where I had to work a ton to be able to pay bills, on top of school, and drinking wouldn't allow me to accomplish those things. It wasn't hard to stop but what came after has been a challenge. 
I suspect I'm having an episode. While I have been able to keep up somewhat. My health is seriously suffering from how little sleep I've been getting. More specifically length of time I've gone with the small amounts of sleep that are accumulating. 
I am pushing myself because I had to. To have food, electricity, a house... Lol. 
So I've been making tons of plans to remodel (for cheap) etc and having major shopping urges which I don't usually go through with. Or I buy it and take it back. I'm usually pretty self aware and understand what I SHOULD do when times like this come on. However, my life didn't allow me to. 
The sheer lack of sleep, usually when I haven't slept all night, will cause me to sometimes see things but not like full hallucinations. Just looking at stuff and mistaking it for something else etc. 
As I'm typing I guess I'm realizing I probably am a bit manic. 
I'll just stop typing because I am going to talk in circles when the entire point of this question was to ask if anyon had stopped drinking and had it trigger and episode?

I'm attaching pictures from the day I stopped drinking so you guys can see. What do you guys think? Do you relate?

"Iâ€™m sorry if this reads as rushed, Iâ€™m kind of in a weird spot right now so I apologize. 

So I was only recently diagnosed with bipolar2 last summer during a hypomanic phase. I got on meds and was normal for maybe 3 weeks, then went into a depression. The most ever sever depression I have ever been in my entire existence, it even ended my relationship twice. That lasted for 7 months.

Finally at new year I got out of it and have been perfectly stable since! 

Except this past week, my anxiety is ramping because Iâ€™m afraid of when Iâ€™m going to be depressed again. My mood has always been very easily â€œtriggeredâ€, and I just heard a song that makes me extremely depressed. 

Sorry lol. My question is, how can I fight this?? I canâ€™t find a lot on the internet talking specifically about a bipolar episode. I am so scared right now and I donâ€™t ever want to be as depressed as I was ever again. Does anyone have any tips or personal experience? I just feel like I only have a small window to fight it before it blows up into a full severe episode.

"Hey everyone

I'm on aripiprazole and an anti-depressant. I also recently just came off Quetiapine. The other night I went out with some friends and had maybe 4-5 drinks over the space of 4-5 hours. 

The next day my friends said I was acting strange and doing some unusual things the previous evening when we were out; however I have very little or no recollection of some of the things they said I was doing and they sound quite unlike me. In fact, my memory of that whole evening is quite hazy and unclear. There's no way any of my drinks were spiked as I was vigilant and ensured they were with me the whole time. 

Is there any way that this could be a side effect or reaction from having alcohol with aripripazole? Has anyone else experienced memory distortions of this nature as a result of the interaction between alcohol and this drug?

He is a public figure who has a lot of sway over is fans on a larger scale than any past public figure. His attitude towards the media, his fans, and twitter involves so much more than whether or not he is taking medication.

Approaching the issue through the lens of analysis we are going to have on a sub regarding mental health has been EXTREMELY unproductive, from what I have seen.

"I have so many thoughts about this. Probably more invested than I should. And I can see from other posts that many people will agree with me but I have so many thoughts/feelings I need to share. Both as a therapist, and as someone living with bipolar.

I started showing symptoms as a teenager. I went from being a relatively â€œstableâ€ and â€œgoodâ€ kid to an irritable, hostile, aggressive, labile, manic, teenager. My mania often showed up as extreme grandiosity and due to the energy and lack of ability to do anything about it I became very irritable and just downright mean. Maybe a mixture of my age, stress, hormones, and my budding disorder. But thatâ€™s how I presented. And during my depressive episodes I became extremely apathetic. Hated God, the world, my mom, anyone close to me, myself. In those ups and downs I did and said a lot of â€œcrazyâ€ shit. I posted a ton on social media. As if it were my diary. I picked fights. I said cruel things. I felt like God. I felt like Satan. I felt like I had power and when others didnâ€™t see it boy did I get mad. And I reacted as such. 

Now, I am doing a lot better. A decade later. I have hindsight and insight and coping skills and am generally very stable.  and can see how erratic and toxic I was. I was (*am*) sick. And a lot of what I went through is characteristic Bipolar. Excuse? No. Symptom? Yes. 
And I was so alone and so scared and confused and sick. I had no idea what was happening to me and often lacked the insight to see I was alternating between those poles and acting erratically or in extremes. And I wish someone had shown me grace. And looking back at that person is hard. Itâ€™s hard for even me to show myself some grace. 

Kanye West has pretty severe Bipolar; we know heâ€™s been hospitalized and experienced psychosis. We know heâ€™s recently been diagnosed after being in the spotlight for decades with speculation. We know heâ€™s has a long-standing history of hardship and the trauma of losing his mother. In addition to this, there is the stress of being a celebrity. Of being in the spotlight 24 seven. In addition to this we know that he is often grandiose, and in real life he has access to quite literally unlimited money, power, and fans. This certainly cannot help his grandiosity and most certainly acts as a catalyst which makes it worse. On top of this we know he has recent stressors of the divorce and difficulty seeing his kids. These stressors are insurmountable for a â€œnormalâ€ person let alone somebody with a mental illness like bipolar. We know we have stressful things that trigger us, how can we expect these things to not trigger him. In addition to the stressor of his album coming out soon. Except heâ€™s under a spotlight. And he clearly lacks insight. We cannot be like everyone else and abandon someone with our disorder just because their symptoms right now are not pretty. We cannot give up on people with mental illness the second they show symptoms. We know that sometimes as a result of our symptoms we say and do things that are not true we are and we might look back and wish we had done things differently. Clearly heâ€™s having these moments as he deletes and re-post things and publicly apologizes only to fire off a few moments later. Heâ€™s sick. And just because that sickness isnâ€™t pretty right now doesnâ€™t mean we get to hate him.

I donâ€™t know about you guys but if I was in his shoes I could see how these behaviors would happen IF i were having a severe episode. Like I said- the reinforcer of his fans, the fame, the power, it definitely negatively influence his symptoms and make it worse. Heâ€™s feeling up and has the whole world at his hands. And heâ€™s unfortunately in the spotlight so everything that he does is judged. And 100% percent agree that a lot of what he does is not appropriate and itâ€™s not always good for others or himself. However, the way that people talk about him and our disorder is not OK. Bipolar people should allowed be allowed to be symptomatic without getting shit on and called horrible people and crazy. And the truth is sometimes some manic people do act like him when theyâ€™re manic. And thatâ€™s not fair that heâ€™s on a stadium constantly so heâ€™s being criticized. 

Look at how people are talking about him- thatâ€™s what they would think of all of us if they saw us at our worst moments. His just so happened to be broadcasted. Please look for yourself in him and see some grace for him whether or not youâ€™re able to find any similarities. Whether or not youâ€™ve ever had symptoms just like his and whether or not youâ€™ve ever made any great mistakes like this before which have hurt yourself or other people. I know if my worst moments were broadcasted that I wouldnâ€™t be too proud either, that doesnâ€™t mean we stop showing support for someone Who we know is struggling.

Yes we need to be accountable but we also need to consider the reality. And yes itâ€™s possible that part of this Hass to do with his personality and maybe we donâ€™t all like his personality or his music. But at the end of the day heâ€™s living with the same disorder that we are and we cannot tolerate the negative things being said about him nor can we buy into it that he is â€œcrazyâ€ or â€œbadâ€ because we know this is not his best day and we have seen better from him. We have seen times are very gentle and kind and giving man. We have seen a creative and talented man. We have seen a loving man. We are not our worst days and we are not our symptoms.

If you donâ€™t agree with me after this I understand and weâ€™re all entitled to our own opinions. But I feel very passionately about this. Maybe because I can see parts of my old self in his behavior, and Iâ€™m reacting so strongly because I remember how attacked I always felt. That being said, I just want people to take a moment to show some grace. Not only to him but to themselves as well. None of us are our worst days. None of us are our disorder. None of us are labels. We all deserve grace. And we donâ€™t deserve the things that people are saying about Kanye West or about our disorder.",bipolar_disorder

She believes they love each other, sheâ€™s getting an apartment near him, and they will be together after our divorce.

"Hello everyone! I am a 26 year old woman and I was diagnosed with bipolar two years ago. It makes sense. It immediately did and I got on lamictal. At first it was awful (for a month until the dose was right), then it was fantastic (for 6 months). After the 6 months it seemed to flatten me out almost entirely and wasnâ€™t too much help with depression. I wasnâ€™t falling to the depths of depression that I used to but I was never really happy. Despite doing my hobbies. Eventually I felt no drive to do literally anything. I couldnâ€™t truly feel happiness and I hated it. I wasnâ€™t myself. I wasnâ€™t social. I couldnâ€™t think properly and I was miserable. 

Sadly, my doctor moved and I couldnâ€™t get in with anyone any time soon because of the pandemic. This last September I decided to taper off my meds. It was a little wanky at first, but eventually I flattened out and felt alright. Until a month ago. 

The last month Iâ€™ve been battling depression pretty heavily. I had a week where I felt fine and then a little manic, but it was back to depression again. 

I am feeling really hopeless. I looked in to ketamine treatments because they have a wonderful success rate, but I canâ€™t afford them. I just donâ€™t want to get back in medication because it feels like it stole a year of my life from me. I donâ€™t feel like myself. I donâ€™t feel fun. Iâ€™m spacey. My memory is bad. But being this depressed is also bad. How do you stay positive? I am a very ambitious person but my disorder and the medication keep stealing my life from me. I feel like I will never get to where I want to go because of this terrible demon inside of me that will never let me go. 

I canâ€™t find a good therapist for bipolar. Iâ€™ve been through a few. Most arenâ€™t taking new patients. The wait to get to a good psychiatrist for medication is 3 MONTHS. 

I know I need to get back on but Iâ€™m just horrified. I want to be happy and successful and a good friend/partner but life is just so difficult. It feels incredibly cruel. I donâ€™t want to unalive myself or anything, but I am very sad right now. I just want literally anything to be easy outside of mania. I want even the most basic things to be easy but literally nothing is. People tell me it makes me strong but I donâ€™t wanna be strong anymore. Iâ€™m so tired.

"(This is a repost from my last with an edit.)

I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder in October during a severe manic episode so Iâ€™m curious to hear othersâ€™ stories.

Hereâ€™s my story.

My episode started in August. A guy with the same name as me messaged me (we were both gonna go to the same college). He asked me a bunch of weird questions thatâ€™d typically set off major red flags like â€œyou jerk off often?â€ I considered him bold. We agreed to become roommates/fuckbuddies. The moment I met him I realized I wasnâ€™t attracted to him. Oh well maybe we can be friends? Nope. One day he came into the room screaming at me because he was locked out the room and I didnt let him in (I was dead asleep). Luckily he sent me a threatening voicemail so I was able to switch roommates. Loved my new roommate so much. 

Moving forward, I started calling my parents at 3am almost every night rambling and screaming blaming them for traumatizing me even though theyâ€™re great parents. I went through my whole contact list calling people from my past I resent and told them all how I felt. I would interrupt my teachers and try to teach the classes myself. I smoke a lot of weed and started hitting dabs out of a big glass dab rig right in front of my school surrounded by people and would offer it to everyone that passed by (someone reported this, I was just trying to be nice ): ) I was suspended. While my mother (bless her heart) was packing my room up because I refused to, I was in the hall shirtless taping my dads business products to the wall and writing about how much I hate him in sharpie. The cops came because I was threatening to the roll the rest of my weed into joints and throw them all over the halls and break the vending machines. That night in the apartment I kept trying to figure out how to get prostitutes to come (to the apartment). 

Back home I became obsessed with trying to get a prostitute. I began talking to one who was probably just a dude from Nigeria. Said to bring $150 to some house. When my dad refused to give me the money I absolutely demolished my living room and kitchen, smashing picture frames and seasoning containers etc. My parents called the cops and I bolted out the house, turning to the prostitute for comfort, (s)he wasnâ€™t very comforting. When I started walking back a cop found me and escorted me back. They talked to me a bit very leaving. That night cops came back and took me to a psych ward. In there I became convinced I was gonna be a porn star, musician, photographer, painter, youtuber, twitch streamer all at the same time. I was so confident.

"5 years since my last hospitalization, Iâ€™m 4 years sober, and Iâ€™ve been the most stable ever in my life. I feel like Iâ€™m just taking my meds to keep it going, with the hope of one day being entirely off them. Not now, I have a newborn so not for a while. And my psych was totally for this and said he had success doing this with other patients.

Now Iâ€™m back to square one, and Iâ€™m really hoping I donâ€™t find a psych that wants to tweak things because Iâ€™m new. I just want to be on maintenance mode with this. Iâ€™ve reallllly taken control of my life in a lot of ways.

"Hey all, Iâ€™ll cut to the chase here I got a bp spectrum diagnosis a couple of months ago. Now I moved to a new state and got reassessed and got diagnosed w BPD and not bipolar. Anyway, I believe I have both for sure. Iâ€™m currently in an agitated depression state or mixed episode where anxiety is through the roof, canâ€™t really sleep, feel really restless and canâ€™t sit still etc. I donâ€™t have it rn be I have had paranoia here and there as well as derealization. I have been here 3.5 months and nothing seems to help.

Meds Iâ€™ve tried:
Effexor (37.5 mg) and abilify 2 mg ( these were my usual meds and they made me stable while I was on them but I was impulsive af) after this episode hit I tried to get back on them but they didnâ€™t work anymore which is weird cuz Iâ€™ve been on these meds on and off for like 9 years

Effexor 37.5mg and seroquel 75mg ( last time I tried this combo again it was a similar reaction to the abilify and Effexor where I felt good but also impulsive) this time it worked for a week then stopped working.

I tried seroquel on its own 100mg then 150mg but nothing, I felt slightly depressed and the episode was still there. 

Added lamictal to the seroquel and I felt better for a bit but then the episode came back 

Upped seroquel to 200 mg and had the lamictal at 100mg again felt better for a bit but then the episode returned

Now my new psych said to try vraylar 1.5 mg, and tbh I feel like shit. I feel what I think may be akathesia right after I take it, Iâ€™m taking it w lamictal too 


At this point idk what to do anymore Iâ€™m really worried â€¦ Iâ€™m not suicidal but I feel awful ðŸ˜ž

I'm learning it's ok to push people away to tell them to leave me alone, do they know how much they hurt me? I'm grocery shopping now, I look at people and wonder if they are ok too, if they're hiding it as much as I am, I look at people and wonder who is also bipolar.

I was diagnosed with bipolar about a year ago and Iâ€™ve never had a therapist. The good times feel good and feel like I can deal with my problems myself. Then the bad time feel really bad and I feel like Iâ€™m drowning. Iâ€™m sure everyone can relate lol. I kinda live in the middle of nowhere and the therapist I had for about a week (they had a medical problem and we couldnâ€™t continue) just wasnâ€™t really experienced enough in bipolar clients. I feel like Iâ€™d just have to do video calls with a therapist if I did decide to get one. Iâ€™m just a little hesitant because I know that can feel like itâ€™s not personal enough.

"Iâ€™m in a mixed episode waiting for my meds, I had to leave the pharmacy twice because I freaked out for the line being too long and slow. 

I have a dog that is very playful and my best friend. I AM NOT OKAY!!!!!!!! 

She is used to having so much attention and playtime outside. Everytime I go outside I get angry and freak the fuck out. I hate being in that state because itâ€™s physically painful and not fair to my dog and humiliates me in front of everyone. 

I wish soooo sooooo. SOOOOOOO.  Badly I could just hide in my room all day. But I canâ€™t. Cause she has to go out. And thereâ€™s soooooo many people outside. And she wants to play and talk to everyone, so I canâ€™t just take her out â€œreally quick.â€ I HAVE to give her these long three walks everyday at ventral park and Iâ€™m sick of that fucking park. 

Iâ€™m so fucking pissed off right now I am OVERRRRR THE FUCKING EDGE!!!!! She keeps randomly barking and then I scream and get even more angry. It ruins my entire state to be able to go outside. 

Then she paces and moves around and irritated the ducking shit out of me!!!!! I need to be alone. I need to be alone. This is too much overload. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I want to block out that I even have a dog I donâ€™t wanna think about it- I NEED TO RELAX!!!!!!!!! 

I sit down? She paces and stares to go outside. Iâ€™m not allowed to sit. If I lay her she will start pacing. If she sits next to me she just opens her belly for me to rub, but then my hands are too fast for her liking and Iâ€™m not calm enough to pet her but then I feel pressure and guilt that Iâ€™m this horrible fucking person when Iâ€™m just really really sick right now with no help:(

Iâ€™m so mad right now and really donâ€™t wanna go out there :( I hate myself for this shit and this is never ending. I have to do it again tomorrow. And the next day. I really donâ€™t wanna go out there if Iâ€™m like this now omg imagine when we are out there. 

I mentioned my dog is my friend so I canâ€™t just go outside and wear headphones and throw a ball. She needs my interaction. If I donâ€™t look at her and focus on my phone, she wonâ€™t get the ball or anything. If I try to walk with headphones and zone out, she will drift behind me so I yell for her to keep up. When usually, Iâ€™d be talking to her the whole time and interacting and like playmates. 

I am not ok and no no one is here to help because everyone who wants to help me wants something from me and wants to see me and hangout with me and then Iâ€™ll be trapped with them when the whole reason I need to be alone is to get away from ALLLLLLL this!!!!!!

I know everyone will say give away my dog. Iâ€™m ranting and sooooo pissed and uncomfortable. I love my dog and she is so well cared for. Iâ€™m just really sick right now and aware itâ€™s not her fault. I donâ€™t take it out on her but feel bad because I know she is worried that Iâ€™m not myself. I just wish I didnâ€™t have this feeling in my body and I wish no one would bother me outside. I wish I could go from A TO B on a walk very quick without my dog leading me around all diff directions to stay longer.",bipolar_disorder
"I need some advice. Iâ€™ve been with my wife for going on 8 years now, and weâ€™re finding out a lot of our problems are stemming from her undiagnosed bipolar disorder. I used to think I was just a real piece of shit, but turns out her lows are a real piece of shit (not her). Iâ€™ve learned to recognize when sheâ€™s going down to the dark place, and letting her know when she stops acting like herself. Itâ€™s interesting because she doesnâ€™t even realizes sheâ€™s doing it until I say something. 

The question I have for yâ€™all is, how can I help her when sheâ€™s in an episode? Anger at the smallest things, lashing out, etc. Iâ€™m a fixer, unfortunately, and I want her to feel better, but it seems space is what gets her out of it the best. I donâ€™t know. I want her to feel comfortable all the time, and loved, but she has such a hatred for her depression and bipolar issues that she feels like she needs to take care of it by herself. Nobody else should worry about them but her. Right now sheâ€™s aggressively deep cleaning the kitchen, and I am keeping my distance in the game room. Now she into the guest room and cleaningâ€¦ 

How can I help her??? Iâ€™m not perfect, I have severe social anxiety and ADD that Iâ€™m medicated for, so when sheâ€™s manic and we sync up we can rule the world together, but how can I help right nowâ€¦",bipolar_disorder

Husband said a few things that made me upset. They weren't even super mean. Just hurt because they were true. So I've been nonstop cleaning. Then I bawled my eyes out for 10 minutes. After that I popped right back up, feeling great and ready to clean, bright eyed and super happy.

My concern is that this kind of emotional event is going to throw me right back into a depressive episode but I'm worried i wont be able to tell how much of it is still needing more meds or just going through the break-up process. Obviously I can't just keep pumping the meds to feel numb but on the other hand it may need to occur in general since i was still having minor anxiety episodes and minor feelings of impulsive ness.

"Even writing this is difficult.  
I was first diagnosed in my third year of undergrad with bipolar with psychotic features after rapid cycling. I did graduate with the degrees that I wanted, and after finally adjusting my medication (lithium and cilexa), things seemed good.  
Then things got bad again, for seemingly no reason. I remember being horribly depressed around Christmas, then things just improved again.   
Now I'm in graduate school, and when I started, I felt wonderful. I was making friends, my research was exciting, and I felt like I found a great place where I belonged.  
But all that has changed.  
Now I spend my days in a haze. I don't feel the drive that I had a few months ago. It saddens me, since I work with some incredible people.   
I've been rapid cycling through life so much that it all doesn't feel real anymore.  
I guess I'm just wondering if others here feel the same.  
Luckily I have a very supporting family, and a wonderful psychiatrist, and a wonderful PI who understands my condition, and has helped in some very important ways.

"For a month now my face by my nose and chin has been red. I've been getting some bumps on my jaw line and neck that have scarred and smaller bumps started to appear on my chin. I've never had acne except for a zit here and there. Nor have I had dry skin this this. So, I started to wonder if it may be a reaction to my Lamictal. 

It is important to note that I live in the very cold and dry Wisconsin winter. Also my anxiety with medical issues has been an issue with catastrophizing/Google doom scrolling. 

I went to the walk-in two days ago (Friday) and at first the doctor said no worries, here's a steroid cream it'll be gone in a week. She left and came back in the room and said on second thought, let's get your liver enzymes and cardiac enzymes because my heart rate was 119 and she wanted to check for lupus. I always have a fast heart rate. Especially at doctors due to anxiety and it comes down after being there a bit. I do need to exercise more. I'm a work in progress. 

Part of that progress has been quitting alcohol. I heavily drank the last 8 years (I'm 28). Today, I'm 23 days sober and very confident I'm never going back.

The doctor said they'd call me with my labs by the end of the day Friday and it is now Sunday. My anxiety is on overdrive. I didn't have it in me to call Saturday because, anxiety.

I'm convinced this isn't a Lamictal rash as it has since cleared up, just my luck. 

My brain won't stop ruminating on the possible liver damage I've done over the years of heavy drinking. 

I just stopped drinking, I've been the best and the most stable I've been in a long time mentally. I just don't want to hear that news. My kid needs me, you know?

Should I worry they haven't called with labs? I have no symptoms of liver damage other than fatigue but I mean... not any more than normal.

If anyone out there can just encourage me with stories or advise on not catastroohizing to get me through until I can call tomorrow, I'd appreciate it. Right now I can't stop thinking about the worst case scenarios.

tl;dr : went to the walk-in for possible rash on my face. Now I'm catastrophizing about my labs showing liver damage from years of heavy drinking (23 days sober). Just would like some encouraging words.",bipolar_disorder

My psychiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar II, I think mainly based on my depressive episodes which last a couple of weeks (though since he put me on Lamictal they're definitely not as bad as they used to be and I actually can function during them, it's mostly an anhedonic feeling now, and I don't feel as helpless as I used to). I'm also seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis, who doesn't think it's bipolar, more like traits of bpd, based on the fact that she's never seen me be hypomanic, and i've always become depressed after periods of long stress. I'm not sure I've ever been hypomanic either.I'm mainly happy and positive about life. I am quite impulsive but I think within reason. I've never caused serious issues for myself or those around me, or got into trouble. Even though i consider myself an introvert and i need my time alone, when im not in a depressive episode i'm quite talkative and easily make friends. So my question is, how serious are your hypomanic episodes?",bipolar_disorder

"Hi everyone. A little background, I was diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder at the age of 15. I got fully blown manic for the first time then and it was severe. At the end of my mania I was psychotic and delusional. I got medicated, heavily, and for the next year and a half I gained about 75lbs. Life was very difficult for the first three years trying to accept the diagnosis I was given. I was smart enough to still retain good grades (mostly As, some Bs) even though I missed 60% of my high school career due to severe depression. 

Since then, I would become slightly hypomanic and then become depressed. Took me some time but by the age of 22 I was doing much better, was on different medications, and was stable. Then, I was put on new medications and gained an additional 40lbs. Fast forward to when I was 28. I decided to get off my medications to lose weight (which I did, I lost about 80lbs in four months due to becoming fully blown manic again). I was very unwell and was hospitalized several times until I was medicated again and gained all the weight back. 

I then found a new psychiatrist, changed medications once again, and I have lost 60lbs since May 2020. I have been stable since March 2019. I am healthier, got accepted to a PhD program, and am doing the best I have done in years in terms of both my physical and mental health. However, every day, I get this paralyzing fear that I will wake up so manic and I will have to take many step backwards. The thing about my Bipolar is that I have the worst form if I become manic. It's classic textbook but very self-destructive and borderline dangerous. I fear that I will become manic again. I take my medications religiously, every night, never miss a dose. I work out each week and have a personal trainer (got one a few weeks ago). I eat healthy and I don't have cheat days. I see my therapist once a month to check-in. I see my psychiatrist every few months. However, even though I have been so stable and I am doing so well, this fear is always in the back of my mind.

I feel as if I may be losing control even though there is nothing to back that up. I am painfully self-aware of my thoughts and behaviors and yet nothing indicates that I have a ny mood instabilities or imbalances. Thankfully, I haven't experienced any depression in the past few years but I have become more anxious (anxiety is new to me). Is this a warranted fear of mine, of me becoming manic suddenly, even though I am taking my medications and taking fare of myself? Has anyone else experienced this fear? Thanks in advance for any insight/help/advice. I try to rationalize this fear but the last time I was manic it was the worst time of my life and the fear doesn't seem to be going away.",bipolar_disorder

"The pharmacy ran out of my meds. Normally when I go without I feel extremely depressed, but this time I was hypomanic. I hadnâ€™t felt so good in ages. Even when I got my refill, I didnâ€™t take them because I didnâ€™t want to come down. But as well all know, mania doesnâ€™t last foreverâ€”and now my life is in the trash.

Depression hit me like a ton of bricks and Iâ€™ve been calling out of work frequently. Today was the icing on the cake. I texted my coworker last minute to let everyone know I wouldnâ€™t be in, but I didnâ€™t let my manager know. I was so ashamed of myself I couldnâ€™t hit the send button. She called me twice and I didnâ€™t pick up, and the day is over and I still havenâ€™t explained myself. I may get fired.

This is one of the best jobs Iâ€™ve ever had and I ruined it. Iâ€™ve spent all of today crying and hating myself. At my lowest I locked myself in the closet and contemplating ending it, and then I hated myself even more for being so low and making my fiancÃ© deal with me.

Iâ€™ve been extremely lucky with my meds. The first thing I tried worked, and I have no side effects. I feel completely normal when Iâ€™m on them. But apparently normal wasnâ€™t good enough for me, and Iâ€™m filled with regret for it. Iâ€™m normally not ashamed of being bipolar because itâ€™s managed well, but today? Iâ€™m so ashamed of the way I am. I feel like I always ruin good things, and I have no one but myself to blame.

Iâ€™ve (obviously) started my meds again, and while Iâ€™ve learned my lesson Iâ€™m worried it wonâ€™t be enough. It takes a couple days for them to kick in and I have to live with myself in the meantime. I donâ€™t want to look for a new job, but I might have to. I havenâ€™t felt this low in almost a year, and itâ€™s hard. I just want to crawl into a hole and never be seen or heard from again. I hate that Iâ€™ve made my own problem everybody elseâ€™s, too. I hate that I have this problem in the first place.",bipolar_disorder
"Not sure where this rant will end up but 
CW: Suicidal thoughts, thoughts of self harm, pessimism

First off, I appreciate you opening my post and taking some time to read my thoughts. 

I feel very alone. I have love and support but I canâ€™t put into words whatâ€™s wrong with me. For the past week or so Iâ€™ve been in a depressed episode. No motivation, no pleasure, bored 24/7, agitated sleep, decreased appetite, the whole 9 yards. But nothing is bringing me down. 

Usually I get triggered by something and then Iâ€™ll be upset for a few days or weeks, at least then I can try to notice a problem or stressor. But itâ€™s been about a week and I canâ€™t figure out whatâ€™s got me down. I guess itâ€™s not that important though. 

I stare at my walls for hours, lay with blankets covering everything but my eyes an nose. Tightening curtains to dampen the sunlight. Iâ€™m so bored and existentially frustrated. Iâ€™m at the point where Iâ€™m either completely checked out or Iâ€™m thinking about death or dying or hurting my hands. 

The worst part is everyone in my life is happy and willing to help. All I have to do is put together the words to try and explain how Iâ€™m feeling. But I canâ€™t. They need reasons, they do their best to understand but they just donâ€™t get that this illness beats us senseless sometimes without rhyme or reason. I guess thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m writing out a rant here instead of my messages app. 

I donâ€™t really know what Iâ€™m looking for from this post. I think I just want to be heard and maybe validated a little :/ :(.

Thank you for reading. I hope peace and happiness find you in your struggles.",bipolar_disorder
"Hello,

As I mentioned in a previous post, next month I will be trying adderall for extreme fatigue. I'm afraid it might trigger mania so I'm trying to come up with a plan so that if I start going manic psychotic again I'll be prepared. Last time I had a manic episode it crept up on me over time, so I'm hoping if it starts happening on the adderall I'll have time to catch it. 

Here's the things I have so far as a plan;

1. Research a psych ward in the area for emergency check in
2. Get emergency contact info for the doctor
3. Track moods daily (I use daylio) 
4. Check in with family daily sometimes in person
5. See therapist twice a week instead of once a week

Is there any other things I should try and do? Any advice is welcome. Last time I had a manic psychotic episode it took me 6 months to recover so I want to be proactive just in case. 

Thank you!",bipolar_disorder

"Hey everyone, could use some words of encouragement/direction. Long and complicated story(arenâ€™t they all). But in short I have dedicated 5+ years of my life to youth camping. It made a huge impact on me as a child, and as someone who came from a traumatic home, camp was a safe place for me that introduced me to young adults I really looked up too. I always have wanted to be able to foster that safe place and pass it on too the next generation. 

So because of this ambition I find myself at a very large summer camp working seasonally for 3 ish years(Covid was a mess). Itâ€™s a lot bigger and more professional than the camp I grew up going to and started working at, but Iâ€™ve always felt supported and I loved the fact that there were so many stable, high functioning adults around me. It offered me the ability to use my social chameleon skills I learned during trauma to just model their behaviors. 

It went well for a while, Iâ€™ve never had anything but positive feedback and I loved working with the kids and groups. Last summer I was depressed for a few reasons, including being passed up for a full time year round position, which would have given me so much more stability in life. I really tried not to let the depression affect my work but when you are working 60 hour+ weeks, people are going to notice. 

Iâ€™ve had a few panic attacks, and last night was the first time at camp I was what I consider, full manic. Honestly the best managed manic episode of my life(meds &amp; therapy have helped a lot). No suicidal ideation, not belligerent or anything of the sort. I just asked for a friend so I didnâ€™t have to go through it alone. Well that was enough for them. They told me today they donâ€™t feel they can support me the way I need. Sadly I agree. I have so many feelings Iâ€™m dealing with, still fighting of the manic episode which was made worse by this news.

I guess I had hoped that their support ran deeper than a puddle, but I canâ€™t change that. I guess my question is has anyone successfully found a career/community that could understand what Iâ€™ve been through, how far Iâ€™ve come, and that I still have ambitions that I donâ€™t want want bipolar to hold me back from.

Hello friends,
I bring good news...happy news meant to Share and Spread the message of Hope and the Love to those in need of it. What has happened seems like such a Rarity that I have to do all I must to keep the Ember from going out. The Fires it has the potential of lighting have the possibility of bringing Warmth and Dryness to many of those still stuck in the Storm.

The message is this....you can get better. Life can improve, and if you find enough willpower in yourself, it is not a matter of 'if' it happens, but 'when.'

I speak of this after coming out of a 2 month long Psychosis fueled Manic episode that lead straight to a Full Fledged year of the some of Darkest Depression I have ever experienced. This last depressive episode quite literally had me standing on the rails of my 2nd story balcony Pondering if that might be my way out.

Today, I sit here typing these words with tears of gratitude for appreciating how Undescribable the Relief feels. This last week has been a Reawaking of my Sense of Self to the world. I'm finally remembering who I am, what I was, who I want to be. Not only this, but my body finally seems to have mustered up the ability to start doing something about that. Change is happening, and all so quickly, so sudden, that my mind is blown away that the Backpack full of Boulders I've been carrying around is only 10ft behind me. And strangely enough, I don't feel the need to turn around and pick them back up.

No more is my Head Feeding me a Stream of Lies. The Insidious and Ominous Cacophony of Twisted, Base-less negative thoughts and anxieties miraculously has come to a silence. The Quiet has Come Back to allow my true self to start Singing Again.
And that I will do, because not everyone gets a second chance, or in my case...a 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th.

This has not come easy. Feelings like this most often times Do Not just Show up at your Door. And if they do, they are only brief guests as a go between. No, these feelings have come from Countless Hours of actually putting in effort, trying to improve. Long nights reading medical journals, researching medications and supplements, watching Ted Talks and Informational Videos online about not just Bipolar Disorder but the entirety of Mental Health as well as How To Beat It. And I have learned drinking lots of water, cutting out unhealthy food, actually eating properly, trying to maintain good sleep hygiene, streching and exercise...all of these things are hard, but they will Nourish your Mind and Body giving you an Adequate platform for your Soul to Launch off from, for how can you Flourish if you're always Sick and Tired? And help is out there. You can learn from anything and anyone, but you have to put Forth the Effort, bring the Willpower, Consciously be Taking Note. There are times when it may seem non-existent, but that Little Voice in the back of your head telling you Not to Give Up when the Weight of the World is crushing every square inch of your body is All it Takes. 

I did it, I beat the odds. The Amount of Struggle I have overcome seems insurmountable Looking Back...and this has given me a New Respect for my illness, for it will overtake me if I do not keep it Tamed and Docile. And I know this may and most likely will not last forever, for life always comes with its Challenges and Uncertainties, but for now when they come, I will be ready, and I will Stand my Ground and Fight.

"I (21 F) was diagnosed bipolar 3 years ago, and I always felt like I needed more structure and emotional support when my family and friends couldnâ€™t provide that for me. When I was manic two months ago I thought it would be a great idea to get an older-ish cat since I had the money and time to provide for him. Now, two months later, I am filled with regret and guilt for not being able to provide the emotional support he needs. When Iâ€™m manic I never want to be home and when Iâ€™m depressed my environment reflects it (dirty, sleeping, and easily agitated).

"Hey,

I haven't felt this low in about five years, a time in my life when I was in and out of the psych ward as a kid.

I'm twenty now, and feel inpatient is the best decision for me both treatment and safety-wise.

I'm really scared about losing my rights, about not having my phone, and about not being able to possibly pursue my preferred career (EMT, requires a state license to practice).

I'll be taking all of this up with my therapist tomorrow but I'm looking for personal perspectives from individuals in similar situations. 

As a kid, I found inpatient to be rather enjoyable - like a break from home. But, I also grew up in an abusive house riddled with drugs and maggots. 

My therapist has been wanting me to go inpatient or at least PHP for months now.

So: is anyone willing to share their experience going inpatient as an adult?",bipolar_disorder

"Hey, so, basically my psychiatrist sent the wrong meds to me. I take 150 mg of Seroquel (which is sent as two separate prescriptions), but my new psychiatrist accidentally sent me 150 mg tabs of Seroquel XR. I've only just realized this now, but it takes a long time to reach my psychiatrist (it's through Zoom and it seems like he's always booked far in advance) and idk if I'll have enough time to contact him before I run out of Seroquel.

My main question is: I know they aren't the same, but would it be, I guess, mostly okay for me to take the Seroquel XR instead until I get my meds fixed? If I stop taking Seroquel I withdraw BAD, and feel really sick. But I know they XR isn't the same, and I'm a bit on the fence if should take it. If I do end up taking it, what should I expect to happen in the short term?

And just to clarify, in case it wasn't clear, this is a temporary fix. I'll be switching back to standard Seroquel at some point during this whole ordeal.",bipolar_disorder

"Title

So, I've been all over the place with my friend groups and i leave them when I feel its better that I stop inflicting stress on myself. I done this when high school ended, got back in touch, and now stuck with this shit.

My current friend group i have had since high school and they lost interest in me. I try my hardest to keep in touch with them but they dont bother nor have the interest in me. Our relationships are very one sided, as in I am always the one who tries to stay in touch.

They constantly talk behind my back about things I do, and they share it with people i cut off for very good reasons. For example at our old DND sessions, they accused me of stealing from their house and blew off my cry for help with mental stress, but in a way that told me i was selfish. This is very funny cause I was the one who consoled them when they needed help, but i guess for me its a problem with them. Keep in mind these were people i trusted. And now I am alone with no one to care, but im starting to prefer it.

To be blunt as i can be, I cant tell if its me anymore. Im probably going to block everyone tonight and never return. Not like they give a fuck anyways. Im tired of the constant fake shit. Why do people go out of their way to lie and make things even worse. If you didn't give a fuck then you should've told me rather than continue to purposefully lie.

If there is literally a single person who thinks i should cut them out of my life, say no more cause ill fucking do that shit immediately. It doesn't even hurt anymore",bipolar_disorder

"Anna Akana is someone I look up to. I like how smart, articulate, and seemingly well-rounded she is and I often watch her vlogs to gain more insight into mental health. I caught up with her recent YT uploads yesterday and came across the **7 words/verbs of intimacy** as detailed by renowned Psychotherapist, Esther Perel, and I felt that it could be a good mental exercise to review all 7.

**7 Words or Verbs of Intimacy**

1. **Ask** \- How comfortable are you asking for your needs to be met?
2. **Take** \- Do you allow yourself to indulge and feel deserving?
3. **Receive** \- Can you acknowledge when someone wants to give you something? e.g. material items, emotional attention, affection, etc.
4. **Give** \- Would you call yourself stingy? Do you tend to over-give? Do you give to people just to please them? 
5. **Share** \- Is there a hesitation for you to share and open up? Does this threaten you or make you feel open and vulnerable?
6. **Refuse** \- Can you say no when you need to? Are you able to set proper boundaries?
7. **Play**  \- Do you feel safe enough to let your guard down and be your true self in front of other people?

This really seems like a reliable framework for anyone wanting to know more about themselves; not just people like me who are dealing with mental health diagnoses.",bipolar_disorder

"There is a TLDR at the bottom, I just wanted to give context before anyone asked. 

For context: I (26f) have been in a relationship with my partner (23f) for just over two years. She is diagnosed with Bipolar type I and has frequent hypomanic/manic episodes, (Iâ€™m talking like at least once a month with hospitalisation once a year). 

I am also diagnosed but with type II paired with ADHD, so needless to say we are a fiery couple with a myriad of issues, but no shortage of love for each other! 

The current situation: after about three months of trying to maintain her stability upon noticing the early signs of mania, we slipped up with the sleep for ONE night (Iâ€™m sure you can guess why) and things started to spiral from there. She became hypomanic and the meds werenâ€™t strong enough to hold her back. It took a turn for the worst when the sleep medication the doctor prescribed had the opposite effect and she became full blown manic. She then went on to drink and smoke behind my back (knowing I wouldâ€™ve urged her not to), and a few hours later we were in the ER to treat her psychosis. 

The dilemma: sheâ€™s been in the psych ward for a couple of weeks now. Sheâ€™s much better now and seems like her hypomanic self. She has, however, been getting far too close with another patient. She confided in me during our last visit, and claims that itâ€™s because sheâ€™s lonely, and I can imagine the hyper-sexuality doesnâ€™t help. The nurses can only do so much to keep them apart, but sheâ€™s still somehow managed to get close enough her to â€¦you knowâ€¦ 

Iâ€™m not jealous because Iâ€™m aware that theyâ€™re both in a vulnerable state and are probably just trying to keep each other company. I also really feel for my partner and how lonely she is, but for obvious reasons I donâ€™t want her getting involved with another patient like that. I told her it was inappropriate and to consider how I feel, then she asked if I could sneak in some of my worn underwear to sniff the next time I bring her clothes so that she wouldnâ€™t have to â€œfind it elsewhereâ€. 

My question is: is this an appropriate thing for me to do? Is it morally ok for me to fulfil this request for someone who is recovering from an episode in a psych ward? It made me uncomfortable at first but at the same time I am her partner and I donâ€™t want her to feel lonely. I wouldnâ€™t even think about this if she were still in psychosis or fully manic but thatâ€™s not the case now. In a vulnerable state, yes, but Iâ€™m not touching her inappropriately or even flirting back, itâ€™s more just that I want to give her everything I can to make her feel more at home in there. Would I be wrong to do this for her?

"For the last four years, I (21f) have dedicated almost all of my time to figuring myself out and becoming a better person. I'm bipolar so I still struggle with a lot of things, but my relationship with myself has improved immensely and I'm comfortable with where I'm at.

Earlier this year, I wanted to get back into dating since I had taken a two year long break. I dated a guy for about four months, and it was awful. We went on two dates before he asked me to be his girlfriend and he was 'in love' with me within two weeks. Coming out of it, I realized the biggest issue was that we rushed into being in a relationship and skipped over a lot of important conversations. It ended so badly that I've been wary of dating again, but I knew that if I let myself sulk over it I would never get over him so I joined a dating app.

I've met a lot of guys on there, a few that I've kind of liked, but nothing spectacular. About two months ago, I met a guy that I'll call John. He's nice, but nothing about him has really stood out to me. Lately, he's expressed frustration that we haven't gone on a date yet.

Now, if I had met John even three months earlier we would have already been in a relationship, practically living together and talking about what we'd name our kids within a few weeks. Then after a few months we'd have an explosive break up and never speak to each other again. All of my relationships since I was 13 have followed this pattern.

Now that I'm able to recognize that pattern, I've been trying to avoid it with John by taking things extremely slowly, which has only caused frustration for both of us. It's hard to maintain interest and we've argued about when we'll meet each other three times now. I really want to stop worrying about it and just see him, but I don't want to deal with another break up caused by pacing issues.

So, how do I balance becoming obsessed with someone within a week and spending months wondering if I'm ready to go on a date?",bipolar_disorder
"So Iâ€™m in a new area and my family is away for a while. I had plans with someone and I was really excited about it but he had to cancel today because he forgot about a work obligation. Completely reasonable and we are rescheduling for Thursday but I am still feeling so bad about myself. I feel like a loser having absolutely no plans today or tomorrow and Iâ€™m bad at being with myself. 

I feel myself feeling more depressed for being alone. I have no issue going to a cafÃ© by myself for lunch but Iâ€™ve never gone out alone for dinner. I thought about bringing a book and sitting at a bar at a casual restaurant, that way Iâ€™m not sitting at a table alone. Is that really weird? I had planned my outfit this morning and I had put it on because I felt good in it and it would also make me sad to not get to use it. 

Is this something you experience too? I canâ€™t help but get depressed or feel bad about myself if plans are cancelled and I feel too alone. Is going out to dinner alone weird? 

Iâ€™m really leaning towards just trying it so wish me luck I guess :)",bipolar_disorder

I am comfortable and trust my bipolar self to make a â€œjointâ€ decision to go and get help with out the embarrassing feeling that Iâ€™m going for help.

Making sense of our feelings and discovering who we are, the good and the bad, has been more helpful to me than any medication. Hope this helps someone.

Hi, Bipolar 1 here. In 2014 I was put on Zoloft (misdiagnosed for Major Depressive Disorder) when I was on Zoloft it was a complete nightmareâ€¦ Apparently, I was totally manic the entire time. My Dr switched me to Abilify immediately without even gently trying to ween me off of it, a few days later I was hospitalized. Spent 6 days inpatient and became stable.

"Five years ago, I was diagnosed with type one bipolar, and currently living alone here in Japan.

I do take my medication and get therapy to help me control my feeling and thought. 

It is kind of hard to explain my feeling or the illness, not just the language barrier (Iâ€™m fluent in Japanese) but also due to the cultural differences, I do find it hard to connect with other people here. (Iâ€™m from the Middle East)

the sad thing is if something ever happened to me here. There is no way for my family to get in contact with me. And will take them a day or two to come here to Tokyo.

At the same time, I do not want to return to my home country. I feel that all my sacrifices will go to waste if I ever go back home. The only path I see is moving forward.

I came to accept that fate. I donâ€™t see my illness as â€¦ curse but as something I need to take responsibility for. 

But I do envy people who do
find happiness and someone to share it with. 

I canâ€™t ask someone from my home country to come to live with me here. 

The culture shock and having to learn Japanese just to do the normal daily routine. And add to that my Illness. I donâ€™t feel it fair or right to drag someone here with me.

"I opened up to my therapist during our last appointment. It was hard. I had to talk to her about a lot of things I didn't want to open up about and still barely scratched the surface. She put in a referral to get a full psych screen done and is hoping that I can get it done over a break when I am home from school. Right now she told me to suspect I have bipolar disorder and I have to log my mood, sleep, and other symptoms daily and we will review it at each appointment.

The not-so-great part of this situation is she said during the appointment that she felt like ""I was pulling her tail"" and that ""these symptoms were too textbook"" she is still treating me so I am not too worried about this statement. Also, she said something along the lines of during the screening what's really going on will come out whether what I am saying is going on is the truth or if I am exaggerating. This actually makes me feel a little better because it will be a psychiatrist doing the screening I don't even know if she will be there at all. but I have been thinking about that a lot since that meeting. I explained to her that I am not making my symptoms up and she said okay but I am worried that there is going to be doubt in her head in the future. I am going to bring this concern up to her at my next appointment. This all just sucks because now I am starting to doubt my own feelings and have gotten into my own head. I know what I have been experiencing but now there is that little voice in my head telling me I am just making it up.

The other thing is I am not letting my mother know what is going on. When I brought this up to her in the past she started to freak out and tell me that I am not bipolar and then started spiraling saying that she is a horrible mother for not noticing the symptoms and it just isn't worth it. So since another suspected thing that I am being tested for during this screening is ADHD I told my mom that she put in the referral for ADHD.

I thought I was fine not listening to my doctor, taking a higher dose of medication.. The stuff makes me so depressed. I dealt with my drug addiction issues, and the stuff makes me feel so drugged. So I decided to stay on the dose I've been on for years, not doubling it like I was told. Things got worse, but manageable.. Not. 
I carved religious symbols into my body, making a deal with the devil.. I'm not even religious. Lost copious amounts of blood and subjected my wife to a horrific few days. said no cops, no hospital, I could keep pressure on it.. I wasn't suicidal. They said I was staring and unresponsive when the EMT and police showed up. My oxygen saturation was 80%, according to the report. I don't have much memory, blood loss, and come to find out, Ativan, have that effect. What little I do remember, I'm mortified. I assaulted several?people, lucky I'm not in jail too. I could barely stand though. 
I was in denial it could ever get this bad. But last week told me I need to get back to seeing a shrink, even though I'm stocked on so much medication.. I've been lying to myself. 
My ego is pretty shattered from this event. Family is grappling with it too. This is a wake up call for sure. Be honest with your support system, it could have prevented this. If you think you got super powers, it's best to let someone know so they can help you. Don't hide it.

He was cooperative going into the psyche ward, but now he wants out and thinks he can manage this on his own. He canâ€™t.

I come in and start typing and about 20 mins into it our head boss comes in and asks me to fill and that he will type the prescriptions. Anyway, the day went by smooth and I told our boss that when the supervisor found out he did such a great job that she'll want a vacation. 

The next day I come in and tell her what a great job the boss did. She replied: ""Well, I had him type because I know how upset and frustrated you can become.""

"Hey everyone. So I'm on 750mg Lithium and 1.5 mg Risperidone. I take 600 of the Lithium at night and 150 in the morning. Ever since I went up on the Lithium, it has just gotten extremely hard for me to wake up in the morning. Like I set my alarm for 7 or 8 or so, but as soon as it goes off, I immediately hit snooze and repeat until it stops and just stay in bed. I'm just so exhausted and groggy and it takes me forever to get out of bed. It's especially annoying because I prefer to workout in the morning so I can shower right after and be good for the rest of the day. I'd rather not workout later and have to take two showers a day. Because it's so hard for me to wake up, I just skip working out altogether because then I have other things I need to do and I missed my chance. I'd also like to wake up at 7 routinely so I have more time in my morning to do things. Has anyone else ever dealt with this? If so, how did you cope? Thank you for your attention.",bipolar_disorder

"The saga of texts to one of my best friends about my ""bad thoughts"" continued into today. He told me I needed to call my doctor and therapist. I told him no for two reasons. First, today is Sunday. I doubt they'd answer their phone. Second, they wouldn't be able to give me the kind of solution I'm looking for. If I called my therapist, she'd probably listen and offer coping strategies. I've exhausted all my coping strategies. I want change, not another pair of rose-colored glasses to try on. As for my doctor, she may have been able to call something into the pharmacy. But I've already posted about how I am a medical anomaly, and nothing is working for me like it should. At best, anything she prescribed would work for a short while and then stop working again. I'd be back to square one again anyway. So, what's the point? This rage is festering inside of me. I could rant about all the things my bipolar has taken away from me, but I don't see the point in that either. Why bother? Things will always remain the same, I am never going to get better, in fact, I might get worse. It's completely and utterly hopeless. You might be saying to yourself, ""Well OP, if you feel that bad, maybe you should go to the hospital."" I refuse. All I'd get there is meds and therapy, and I've already explained why I don't want either. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on Tuesday.

Iâ€™m a little concerned I may have induced mania but I Have no clue bc if I did itâ€™s not bad my typical test is to drink caffeine or eat sugar and see how much the energizes me that only works if my mania is bad.

Anyways whatâ€™s the likely hood I may have enduced mania from not sleeping for 30+ hrs straight? 

And what are some tests bc tbh Iâ€™m pretty energized rn I was tired for the first 20 hrs but ever since I past around 24 I felt fine and after finishing my project for class I feek even more energized, maybe itâ€™s excitement from finishing a projects?

I just don't know what im going to do if this doesn't work for me. Usually i feel pretty hopeful but ive been fighting to try lamictal for so long and been denied by NPs. Now that i am seeing a psych md he told me he thinks this is the best choice for me to try next. It was a huge relief but now that im doing it, im overwhelmed with anxiety about if it doesn't work or if i get the rash. 

I am SO anxious. 

 I'm terrified of getting the stevens johnson rash. I keep thinking about when i had an allergic reaction to penicillin and had to go to the hospital. That was terrifying and this rash would be infinitely worse.


I feel like any other medication is going to continue to have terrible side effects for me and i need the relief  so badly. Ive got some metabolic issues that make some meds a bad idea for my health, even with cognitive effects aside.

3- i was diagnosed when i was 2/3 done with law school and i wish i could have found out sooner and just not chosen a high stress/ high intensity career. By the time i figured out I'm bipolar, i was already deep into the financial and time investment and it made no sense to stop. 

I've been doing okay with this. I finished my third year with strong grades but I had to stop my medication to do that because it was making me sleep all day and be a zombie. I tried 3 before i went off it. I passed my licensing exam by forcing myself into an exceptionally regimented study /sleep/ exercise regimen. I did well at my first job other than a hypomanic episode that presented at work with ADHD like symptoms. I had to go on seroquel, which brought me down but made me too tired and foggy to focus. 
I hung on, but my lack of focus was noticeable to my boss. He mentioned it to me when he grew frustrated with me making silly mistakes and being distracted.

Now i have a new job and its also going fine but now im in a place where if i fuck up my career can be completely ruined. 

I stayed just on wellbutrin for a year and a half , was affected for a long time after by an abusive relationship with my classmate that i got into because he helped me when my family wasn't there for me while i went through the pretty devastating manic episode (got to the point of daily panic attacks, no concept of time, and some milder psychosis)

"Diagnosed BP2 (manifested from SSRIs for anxiety). I was on abilify for 7 years and while it managed my symptoms well, I developed TD in my right side. Bad twitching in my eyes &amp; mouth, right hand spasms.

And it kept getting worse, until I cold turkey'd the atypicals.

Would you suffer the physical manifestation of the disability and risk it worsening to keep your mania under control, or would you rather live with the unstable mood?

"Hi, IDK if this is the right sub to ask in since IDK if I have bipolar, I just tend to have episodes of mania, but this is the only sub known to me that even deals w the topic of mania !!

I identify as a lesbian and have done so for a while. My issue is, IDK if meeting certain types of men will trigger an episode of mania or not, but if Im in an episode I will go completely hypersexual for men and forcibly feminize myself for them and, if a man accepts my advances or something, end up completely traumatized afterwards. I know that I usually do not have any interest in men, and I know that theres no ROMANTIC interest in them anyways, but during episodes I tend to get super obsessed with them and make myself emotionally dependent on them. 

Ive seen a good amount of posts by bisexual or flexible people that say they'll lean a lot more towards one gender during an episode, or that theyll get hypersexual, but I havent really read about any lesbians that develop heterosexual tendencies or heterosexuals that develop gay/lesbian tendencies.

i have noticed something that hasnt really happened to me in this extent. the past few days the smallest think that hurts my insecurities will set me off (despite feeling awesome otherwise) and i will start ugly crying and then hysterically laughing and still crying at the same time. for example, bf made a very obvious joke about me being bad at social stuff, and the above happened. note that it was not malicious at all, just a joke, but i am a little socially weird, i do admit. still does not warrant wailing though. 

i dont even know where i am going with this.

"I just moved and saw a new psychiatrist. Iâ€™ve had two years of treatment with two other doctors before this. Related, my long term boyfriend who I live with is a psychiatrist.

"Hi. My nameâ€™s Izzy, 25F. I was diagnosed with bipolar in 2017. Iâ€™ve been on a lot of different kinds of medications, for now Iâ€™m on the Abilify Maintena injection as well as Seroquel, but the medication thatâ€™s been more of a constant throughout my course of treatment has been the Seroquel. I was on lithium for a while but they took me off of it quite a long time ago. 

I wanted to ask other members of this Reddit page who have some experience with antipsychotics, to be honestâ€¦ Iâ€™ve noticed that ever since I started taking them, Iâ€™ve had a lot of muscle stiffness. I also experience overwhelming degrees of lethargy throughout the day, and sometimes at night, after taking my medication, I just get so hungry. Iâ€™ve put on some weight. At first, it as just 3 kg, which isnâ€™t nearly as bad as itâ€™s been for a lot of people around the world. However, I gained an additional 5 kg after starting Abilify Maintena, despite my psychiatrist telling me that Abilify Maintena is weight neutral. A part of me wonders whether she just told me that to shut me upâ€¦ as I see a lot of other people on Reddit have put on weight taking Abilify Maintena.

I wanted to ask members of this Reddit page, particularly ones whoâ€™ve taken antipsychotics and who have been weaned off of them with the help of a psychiatrist - what was life like after you stopped taking antipsychotics? Was it harder, or was it manageable? Why did you stop taking antipsychotics? What Iâ€™m really interested in knowing is, do the side effects go away? Does the muscle stiffness go away? Does the tiredness go away? Do the hunger pangs go away? Does the weight go away, or does it stubbornly stay on after that? Does your metabolism ever recover from years of using antipsychotics? Does your motivation ever return? Ever since I started taking antipsychotics, I just feel so unwell all the time. Iâ€™m not as fit as I used to be, and am not as motivated as I used to be either. Iâ€™ve lost my drive to exercise as well as my sense of ambition, and am just going through the motions, and it really hurts me. When I started taking Abilify Maintena, not much really changed. The muscle stiffness stayed, the lethargy remained the same, the lack of motivation remained, and well, as I mentioned, I gained some weight.

I think I am generally not on too much medication, and eventually hope to wean myself off of it as I really am personally quite adverse to taking medication because the side effects are just so bad for meâ€¦ as they are for a lot of people. I know it will take time, but I canâ€™t help but wait for the day I donâ€™t need to be on medication anymore. Or if anything, I hope to switch to a sleeping medication over antipsychotics, as my manic tendencies have only flared up in the past when I have been sleep deprived. 
Please note that I am in no way encouraging anybody to stop taking their medication, especially without the help of a licensed professional. Thatâ€™s dangerous. These are just my personal hopes for the eventual futureâ€¦ My bipolar symptoms have been relatively mild. I had a manic episode after fracturing my spine in two places and finding a 3x3x2.5cm tumour in my breast at the same time (which is when I got diagnosed) but I donâ€™t really blame myself for that. 

Sorry for rambling. 
Tl;dr 
to those who have been on antipsychotics and who have stopped taking them - how have you been feeling? Why did you stop taking them? What was your experience before/during/after taking antipsychotics? Do the side effects of the medication (e.g. muscle stiffness, lethargy, weight gain, lack of motivation, compromised metabolism etc.) ever really go away?

I took medication for it for a while but stopped because I was convinced I was misdiagnosed. I'm autistic and autistic women tend to get misdiagnosed as bipolar. I thought they were just confusing my autism &amp; ADHD with bipolar, but I was technically diagnosed with both. I blamed my depression on the autism, and I'm sure it's a part of it, and I blamed my mania on my ADHD.   
However, I just got done spiraling. I stopped taking my medicine a few months ago and I felt fine for a while. This episode started a few weeks ago, maybe even a month ago. It started with me smoking weed every day for two weeks, which lead to me quitting my job, then I hid away in my room, then I started having suicidal idealization thoughts, then I blew up at my friends and attempted to push them away with the intention of committing suicide. I felt like I had no control over what I was doing and I deeply hurt and scared a lot of people I care about. I've experienced being depressed and I've experienced being manic. But the thing that has convinced me that I was wrong about my diagnosis was I just experienced manic-depression. At least I think so, I've never been through anything like this before.

Unlike her sister, you'd never guess I have BP, I've been episode free since 2019, I'm fully independent, hold down a full time job and well as full time uni, have a strong social life and am entirely stable. No one in my life, apart from my parents, knows I have bipolar and no one would ever guess. Tbh sometimes I think I've outgrown it but I'm not willing to test going off my (now low dose) of lithium. But regardless my partner needs to know.

She does know there's something wrong with me, bc we have talked about my pretty severe (but old) self harm scars and she knows I take medication. So this would not be out of nowhere.

Someone just tell me I need to bite the bullet and tell her. I'm just worried she won't understand that my bipolar is managed and I won't ever be like her sister.",bipolar_disorder
"I'm curious as to how many of you have any experience with sleep apnea? I've read that sleep apnea and bipolar can often be co-morbid, and my partner has suggested I get checked out for it. 

I've had problems with sleep for as long as I can remember, and I (34M) still have a near impossible time getting out of bed. I have to set about 15 alarms to get up, and often in other rooms so I don't hit the snooze. My partner also tells me I'm like a zombie and a completely different person when I'm trying to get up. I could also sleep through an earthquake just fine - it's very hard to wake me. I know my relationship with sleep is irregular compared to normal people, but I've never had any luck changing it since I was a teenager, so I just accepted it a long time ago. Does anyone have any advice on this? Maybe a similar story? I'd appreciate any thoughts on it. Thanks!",bipolar_disorder

"I recently got diagnosed with Bipolar 1 after a recent manic episode that landed me in a psychiatric hold. Prior to that, Iâ€™ve always had this idea that there was something wrong but I shrugged it off as many family and friends believed that it was just in my head and if I changed my routine, I would be better. However, getting this diagnosis finally gave me a sense of relief; that I was dealing with something that was more out of my control. I just wanted to share this post to find a community of individuals who have gone through the same struggles of stigma, being diagnosed with bipolar, and navigating it. I know itâ€™s going to be a lengthy process of finding the right medication and all, but Iâ€™m more hopeful now than I was before.

"About two years ago I started experiencing periods of psychosis. I started seeing a psychiatrist and she determined that im suffering from bipolar disorder. she put me on anti-depressants, to â€œtestâ€ it ig, and obviously i had a very bad reaction to it. i then got put on lamictal and abilify but the side effects scared me so i stopped them.

recently i just got diagnosed with adhd and this is a new psychiatrist, who doesnt know about the bipolar (i was never officially diagnosed bc my old psychiatrist said it could negatively affect me to have a diagnosis or smth so i just didnt it up). she put me on stimulants and so far ive been doing really good. i havent had any bipolar symptoms (i have been depressed lately but its probably unrelated). ive been on them for about three or four months

"About a month ago I posted here about how bad my depressive episodes were and how I was at the end of my rope. A few of you reached out and provided support and guidance (which I appreciate more than you know), so I figured Iâ€™d update.

My psychiatrist finally got back to me, and after another assessment and lots of talking, he believes that not only do I have bipolar 2, but Iâ€™ve earned myself severe clinical depression and PMDD to boot. Weâ€™re continuing my 300mg lamotrigine, 450mg Wellbutrin, and 4mg of tizanidine once daily. We added on Zoloft. Started on 50mg once a day and upped to 100mg after a week.

Iâ€™ve been really nauseated, tired, and have had wicked dry mouth BUT I havenâ€™t cried and have actually felt closer to being happy. Iâ€™ve actually been able to get out of bed and function. My psych said the side effects should become less prevalent as the weeks go on, but so far Iâ€™m crossing my fingers. Itâ€™s probably too early to celebrate, but itâ€™s improvement and Iâ€™m taking it.

"A few weeks ago I had an appointment with a new doctor (really an NP) and she was asking a lot of questions about my bipolar disorder, and it kind of turned into a debate on what qualifies a BP1 diagnosis. 

Basically, she thinks that I can't be BP1 because I've never experienced psychosis during a manic episode, and that I tend to sleep relatively well compared to others. 

When I'm manic, I use a lot of sleeping supplements and medication to make sure I get 8 hours, but usually during those times I still only get 6 or 7 hours of sleep. My mania tends to be less severe than most people; I get better sleep than others, I can control my impulses a little bit better, I very rarely have mixed mania, and I don't have psychosis. I still get all the other symptoms though - pressured speech, hypersexuality, lower tolerance to anger, high energy with less sleep, and generally riskier behaviors (impulsive spending, sex w strangers, drug abuse, etc) and it lasts for usually 2 - 3 months. 

She thinks that because I have never been hospitalized or psychotic, I can't have BP1. I asked her why there is a difference between BP1 and BP1 with psychotic features, and she basically just doubled down on her argument and said that all BP1 patients have psychotic episodes. 

I'm pretty young and have been treating my disorder fairly well, which I think is probably why I haven't had a psychotic episode (yet) but I want to know what you guys think of this. Will this have any effect on my treatment in the future? If she changes my diagnosis to BP2, are there any implications I should know about? Should I take any actions about this like scheduling an appointment with the psychiatrist at this medical group or should I just let it slide and carry on?

TL;DR : If you don't want to read all the context about us, just scroll until you see a list. 



Me and my friend relationship has been complicated due to both our mental healths, and personalities. 

I'd like to be able to help her better by understanding better BP, and more specifically know what things from her behaviour are due to bipolar, her past, or her personality. (Could obviously be from a mix).

Some of her behaviour is hurting me deeply, and approaching this would be vastly different if it's something that comes mainly from BP, or if it's simply one ""bad trait"" (we all have some).
I'd also like to help her grow, deal with various stuff (including herself) and support her.


About us :

We met in our town's psychiatric clinic in January. We both left from there in March.

I (26F) am depressed, and been so since I was 12. I came there because of suicidal plans that got worse last autumn. Due to very low self esteem, the only way I feel not-too-bad is by feeling helpful. And by that I mean I will put everything about me on the side and put myself entirely to help someone. I am aware that this is unhealthy, and am talking with my psychiatrist about it.

She (37F) came there for a variety of reasons, the main official one being getting off of her 20+ years marijuana addiction. She stopped during the clinic and hasn't touched it since (something she's very rightfully proud about). But she's also dealing with various other problems. When she came to the clinic, she was very quickly diagnosed as having BPD, and she struggle to come to terms about it. She also already had meds to deal with her very high anxiety. She's got a heart condition that she's very stressed about. She's got her (un)fair deal of traumas that she never dealt with (she escaped them through smoking) : - her mother killed herself when she was a teenager due to her step father beating her. - this meaning she's witnessed domestic abuse during her childhood. - her stepfather tried to rape her. - she saw one of her teenage friend being raped by him. - her mother also had mental health problems and this resulted in neglecting my friend during her childhood. - the rest of her family rejected her due to homophobia. - she had one boyfriend when she was younger, and he hit her a few times. - Everytime she had a serious relationship with someone, it turns out she was only the ""side chick"". - except for one, and they got engaged , but my friend's behaviour and addiction ruined it and the wedding was cancelled.  - the death by cancer of her best friend in January, just before she came to the clinic. This list is unfortunately not complete. More about her relationship with her ex fiancÃ©e, as it is affecting her a lot currently : they fight and reconcile every year, and it's only ups and down.  My friend is being used by her (to the point of having financial problems, as she's sending all her money to her ex). My friend is still in love with her, but is aware that this is destroying her and her current relationships (her teenage daughter and me). I won't go into details, but this is by VERY far the most toxic relationship I've seen between two people.

About our relationship : it has been extremely unbalanced, basically all I'm doing is helping her both materially and emotionally. We sometime sleep together, but it has been very clear from the begginning that is not going to be a romantic relationship, as none of us are currently able to have a healthy one (also age difference, and her not being over her ex). I am driving her around to her medical appointments, fighting to get her meds when necessary, running to her whenever she has a breakdown, even in the middle of the night, listening to her for hours, getting her ""back to earth"" during paranoia crisis, calming her down when she gets very angry, helping her with papers etc etc. From the other side, at some point last month she has been asked my family name, and she... didn't even know it. When I try to talk about me she can't handle if it's mental health related (it is understandable she can't hear about suicide, due to her trauma with it), but even if it's about things I like, my past or fun facts, she always come back to herself very fast.
We've had a serious conversation about this two weeks ago. She realised this was unbalanced and her behaviour towards me was selfish. I told her this situation is also partly due to me (as explained at the beginning of the post). She promised me to do better, and is feeling very guilty about this (I know for a fact through her daughter). Unfortunately, her behaviour hasn't changed.

Important note : I am NOT trying to help her more. On the opposite, I am actually trying to reduce the amount of time/energy I spend in this to make it healthier, and her less dependant on me. I still want to be friends with her though. And friends help friends. This means I have to ""choose my fights"", and by understanding what comes from BDP/trauma/personnality I can do better and with less time. For example, helping someone heal from past trauma to continue forwards in life isn't the same kind of support as acknowledging a mental problem and help deal with it. Nor is it the same as constructive criticism.

Some aspects of her behaviour that I'm wondering whether they're mostly due to bdp, trauma or just her personality. I obviously have guesses about most of them, but I'd like to have the opinions of others :

- very high anxiety, about everything, all the time
- very high jalousy in all aspects of life
- easily hurt in her feelings
- afraid of losing people
- paranoia
- anger problem (this is the one hurting me the most)
- behaviour of immediately attacking/threatening people she cares about when she feels hurt
- only talks about two topics : her own pain/anxieties, and the people she's mad at (can be loved ones she'll cherish the day after)
- is very changing with me : when she's drunk she's all sweet and tells me she loves me etc, when she's sober she 90% talks about herself and 10% thanks me for being here for her (but not supporting me or anything about me), and when I don't answer on the phone for more than two hours gets jealous, extremely angry, swears at me and tells me to fuck off etc. If I agree to not see her again, she suddenly changes her mind and says she needs me. If I don't answer, she'll return to normal the following day, and I only get apologies if I ask for them.
- lying
- all her social relationships are based on the same pattern : conflict-apologies again and again at various speed, but never addressing the underlying issues 
- unable to compromise
- unable to understand someone else's point of view on her own (can be done if explained by me calmy and slowly)
- is emotionally abusive to her teenage daughter living with her
- has a habit of cancelling or postponing medical appointments (all.the.time) She's extremely anxious about going to them, but when she does she's happy.
- self destructive behaviour (such as drinking -she's basically and alcoholic now, or the cancellation of appointment thing)

Her current treatment includes an antidepressant, an antipsychotic and vallium. She sees a psychiatrist, but only once a month unfortunately.

So, here comes the questions:
- People who have BP or know someone with that diagnosis: Does any of this on the list sound familiar? Which specific behaviour or thinking patterns in particular?
- People with similar trauma : How have you dealt/are you dealing with this? What helped you?

"In 2011-2013, I believed I was going to win the lottery. Now, that doesn't sound like a big deal. People play because they think they can win. And when I tell people I had delusions where thought I was going to win the lottery, they brush it off because everyone who plays thinks that.

But it was more than gamblers hope. It was full fledged delusion.

I would buy a powerball ticket twice a week for Wednesday and Saturday drawing. I was going to win, obviously, so it wasn't a big deal to go ahead and put some purchases on the credit card because I would pay it off when the winnings came. I was failing out of college, and lost my full ride scholarship where they actually paid me $2,000 per semester just to attend. But that was okay, because I wouldn't need to work since I'd be set.

And the day of the drawing would come. And I wouldn't win. It was like my brain just... Cracked. It was like being told the color blue wasn't blue, and it was such an intrinsic shattering of my psyche each time I didn't win. I would crawl into my closet and cry myself to sleep. It was like the rules of reality were suddenly broken and I couldn't comprehend that I didn't win, because I was going to win. ""Next time, it'll be next time.""

So when I try to explain to people about this delusion, they never understand how bad it was. It wasn't a gambling addiction. It was something more bizarre and innately wrong with my whole brain and perception of reality. 

I stopped playing and haven't bought a ticket in 9 years. 

But lately, I've been dwelling. I think about what would happen if I won now. I spend my downtime looking at real estate I could buy on websites. I plan out who I would tell and who I wouldn't. 

I haven't bought a ticket, but the obsessive thoughts are every day and it scares me. If I give in and buy even one ticket, I'm terrified it's game over for me.",bipolar_disorder

Iâ€™m 22, but in high school I remember barely being able to stay awake in school. Now that Iâ€™m older I just feel like Iâ€™m more prone to tiredness than all my friends and I can barely stay up past 10pm most nights. After being diagnosed, I came to the conclusion that this is likely because of depression, but I still experience this on meds and when not full on depressed. I also wonder if maybe my meds, latuda, cause daytime tiredness, but Iâ€™ve also had issues with fatigue since before meds. I literally take a relatively high dose of adderall and still feel tired during the day. Obviously, this fatigue excludes my manic/hypomanic phases. Iâ€™m going to the doctor soon to see if I have any vitamin deficiencies or underlying health issues, but is it likely this fatigue is just lingering depression/bipolar? Maybe even when Iâ€™m not full blown depressed I still have lingering depression that manifests as fatigue?",bipolar_disorder
"The midwife wasn't able to give the notes at my appointment (the 'yellow book', if you're familiar in the UK) because she didn't have them at the time. My wife works at the same clinic so she picked them up today while she was there. I had no idea that my private notes were inside it - in fact, I had no idea about what the yellow book would contain because I've never seen one before.

Well. About 6 weeks ago I had my first appointment with an ante-natal psychiatrist. I was a mess. My quetiapine wasn't working. The hormones had made me suicidal. At the time everything was so bleak I wanted to end the pregnancy and my life. I expressed this to the psychiatrist, and said that yes - my wife does find it hard to deal with my illness. Who's partner wouldn't. At the time I was seriously considering leaving her because I felt she didn't understand at all. I felt (obviously a key component of having bipolar) that nobody understood me, least of all her, and that she was judging my character rather than fully recognising that I was sick. Every minute of my life was sheer torture and I just wanted to crawl into a hole and die. I was sent the notes from that appointment (obviously addressed to me) and when I read them they made me upset. There it was, in black and white - my family history, my struggles, all my darkness spelled out by a professional. I folded up the notes and buried them in my wardrobe.

Well. A copy of those fucking notes were in that yellow book. My wife obviously had a flick through because she sent me a picture of them with the part about me saying I'd had ""thoughts about ending the relationship"" and that ""she has difficulty dealing with my mental health problems"". Both of which are true statements. Both of which I have expressed and admitted to my wife in my darkest hours. 

About three weeks ago I switched from quetiapine to aripriprazole and feel like a different person. The depression has essentially lifted (albeit having left me feeling like I've been beaten up) and I am returning to a functional version of myself, excited about creative projects I feel well enough to work on, and - thankfully - things have been improving with my wife. 

But now she is upset. She's upset to have read these notes, and quite frankly, I'm upset she read them. I don't regret saying it because it was true at the time and a part of why I was struggling. I feel a bit like she's done the equivalent of read my diary, except it's worse than that - it's someone else's diary talking about me talking about her. She is upset.

How should I best move forward here? Was she wrong to read my notes? She said ""I didn't think there was anything in there I shouldn't read"". But It's still my file.

Now I feel like I'm going to be punished and this will take us back three steps. I don't know if I have the right to be upset with her for reading my private notes, or if I should have gone through the notes with her the first time when they were sent to me. 

My gut reaction is that I actually feel violated here. I feel like my private space to share my thoughts and feelings about my debilitating illness has been exposed. The one place where it can be about me, that I can be unrestrained and completely honest, has been looked at with a magnifying glass by my wife. I'm also upset that that's the part she chooses to focus on. Yes, it's about her. But there's some tragic fucking shit in that letter. It's not, ""I'm so sorry you \*felt\* that way,"" or ""it was hard to read how much pain you've been in"". It's: ""you said this about me.""

Yes. I did. And I said it to you, too, because that's how I bloody felt.

I am going through something personal that I have no control over, and I'm the o ly thing that I can do anything about, but I want to self-destruct in so many different ways, in fact it feels those are the only attainable options.

"When i feel good :my vocabulary,Memory, and Whole mental skills They go back to being my actual ones and i can really feel myself.Mind ,body and soul are aligned.
Speeches are fluid, I already know what to say from start to finish just by thinking about what I mean. I don't get stuck, I can use sophisticated words and express myself with depth of thought.


When i am depressed or Just slight depressed:I find it hard to express myself, I forget words even though I know that I know them well.
As if I were giving the brain input to retrieve information, the input starts and I know the output is there in my mind. I just can't access that information. Almost as if the connection bridge between input and output had burned out.I can't access many memories.short term Memory Is fucked up . Sometimes I stammer(something i never done in my Life ). My thoughts are no longer so profound and the difference is clear ,as this Is really not myself.
I have to think hard to build a speech, the words don't come out smoothly.
All of this is so serious at times that I can't stop feeling bad if I just think about it. How do I go on if my brain turns off 40% of its volume just because it has decided to be depressed.


And I must say that over time, there is no doubt that a sharp decline in my actual abilities is taking place little by little even in the feeling stable regime .

Anyone else experiencing this ?

"I went manic, inpatient for 3 week changing meds. Started to sleep again and felt less anxious so decided to leave 5 days ago.

Went shopping first day of freedom and spent about $700, I can afford it but clearly was a sign I'm still manic.

Anyway now I'm not sleeping again the past 2 nights.

My fiance is being really mean to me, I did everything he asked of me since coming home, went to 2 parties with him, helped his friend who just arrived in the country who I think he actually used to sleep with.

Tried doing his washing but the machine broke. He went crazy at me like somehow it was my fault.

Basically I'm trying to people please to make up for being in hospital but I do nothing right.

But I'm struggling and my fiance is being so horrible.

He yells at me, swore at me for asking we drive 30 mins to get some more meds because my valium is getting low.

I asked if he could get me a frozen raspberry drink because my throat hurts from nervous vomitting and he exploded like it was the most unreasonable request even.

His excuse.

He is lonely living in a other country even though he has been here 5 years and has like 50 million friends, doing social things almost every day. And when not drinking beers and having parties he is on whatsapp chatting to friends. I know not to interrupt him certain.hours of the day because he is not available.to talk to me during that time even though he happily lives in the apartment I brought. I asked if he is cheating on me today and he didn't deny it.

He says I should be more accommodating of his feelings, when all I ask is he please not swear and yell at me because if hurts me.

If anyone should be lonely it is me, I have like 2 friends who check every few weeks that I am still alive and that is it. I spend the rest of my days scared of doing something wrong.

My only support is my cat. 

I reached out to a friend tonight but she is with her mum and I don't want to be a burden.

I'm just so confused.

"I have Bipolar 2 and since a year back had an addiction with a nicotine based product (called snus, I think itâ€™s only sold in Sweden). I first began because I had a lot of stress for upcoming tests and was severly depressed at this time. Iâ€™ve tried to stop several times but I always start again. I donâ€™t know how to stop taking it since I always get the urge to start again when feeling stressed. I really want to stop. Iâ€™ve never tried drugs and really hope I donâ€™t go down that rabbit hole some day. So I was wondering if anyone else has a problem with addiction and if you have any tips on how to stop?",bipolar_disorder
"Two years ago, a guy tried to take advantage of me. I was drunk in a bar, and he got me a water. Thirty minutes later, I was unable to walk or move. When getting escorted back to my room, he tried to stay with me, but another guy prevented him from doing so. Iâ€™m pretty sure he roofied me. Iâ€™ve always known what his intentions were, but Iâ€™m not turned off by what he did. 

If anything, I have feelings for him. No other guy has liked me that way before. Maybe there have been other guys who liked me, but none have ever been so overt about their interest in me. Weâ€™re still social media friends, and my hope is that we can get married and live happily ever after. Heâ€™s always on my social media. He clearly has feelings for me, because he is lurking on it at least five times a day (I have an app that tells me).

Another thing that didnâ€™t help was that at 
the same time, a guy that I liked had a girlfriend. He kept the fact that he had a girlfriend (not intentionally, but still) from me, and I was so disappointed. My original crush genuinely liked me too, but he cut things off to preserve the relationship with his girlfriend. No one ever liked me back before, and my crush just threw it all in the trash. It wouldnâ€™t have been right if he cheated on his girlfriend, or left her for me, but I did nothing. He was the one that led me on. And despite having feelings for me, he chose her. Maybe to most people, he did the right thing, but in my eyes, he renounced me. 

So I redirected my feelings for my crush onto this other guy. Not only was he available, but he also texted me (because he knew about my crush), and asked me if I was okay. He has some bad qualities, but that shows character. Even though I rejected his advances, he was kind enough to check up on me, despite having all the reason not to. He fought for me. Isnâ€™t that what loveâ€™s all about? Fighting for someone, even when itâ€™s difficult? Iâ€™m not going to lie, part of me wants to get back at my original crush, because they were acquaintances at one point, and if it means harming myself in the process, so be it, because my original crush still likes me, but isnâ€™t reaching out. I know for a fact that heâ€™s single now. They literally broke up only two months after he and I met. Still, even if he came back apologizing, my feelings for this other guy are too strong now. 

Given how confident he was with me, he likely has done what he did to me before. It disgusts me if he has done it to other girls, but he did tell people that I was the most beautiful girl heâ€™s ever seen, so hopefully he only does bad stuff to me. I admit, Iâ€™m a virgin, never had a boyfriend before either. I want to have sex so bad. I know heâ€™ll likely hurt me really bad, but he said that Iâ€™m the most beautiful girl heâ€™s ever seen. He told mutual friends this. 

I want to get married to him and be financially dependent on him. I want to be pregnant with his children, and have lots of babies with him. Knowing what I know about him, he has some abusive tendencies, but not to worry. I wonâ€™t let him hurt our babies. Iâ€™ll redirect his anger and frustrations on me. No one has ever loved me before, and heâ€™s the best I can do. I donâ€™t want anyone else, just him. I know itâ€™s likely that he may end up killing me. But Iâ€™ve been really depressed for years, and my one goal in life is to have children, so as long as my early death happens after I have children, Iâ€™ll be okay with that. 

I know itâ€™s wrong. I know I should be disgusted by what he did. If a friend told me this happened to her, Iâ€™d tell her to run for the hills. But I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m 21 years old, and no guy has ever expressed any interest in me before. I want to get married and have babies, and if it means getting married to a monster, so be it. I can learn to love him, and he can learn to love me.",bipolar_disorder

What I was wondering is if anyone has any strategies for this or could recommend some foods that I would be able to keep near my bed and would be suitably filling to be able to take my meds.

"hey! iâ€™m a f (20) with bipolar 1 and iâ€™ve been struggling for the last few months. i was fairly stable for months up until i contracted covid in april â€˜22. 

following being ill i have been having lots of physical symptoms which has led me to believe i have long covid, however i have received mixed responses from medical professionals who believe it could be anxiety and/or depression. 

i have had an large increase in panic attacks, worse than iâ€™ve ever experienced. each attack feels like i am truly dying and manifests in many physical forms.

however iâ€™m finding it hard to distinguish between what could be long covid real physical symptoms and what could be mental health psychosomatic symptoms.

iâ€™m getting almost daily headaches, shakes, derealisation, extreme brain fog and fatigue, feeling weak, numbness, shortness of breath, palpitations and the feeling of impending doom. 

itâ€™s been really debilitating. iâ€™ve had to take time off work and really push to finish the uni semester. iâ€™m barely leaving the house. socialising is super draining and i feel myself getting tired after seeing anyone. for the most part iâ€™ve been bed bound.

iâ€™m constantly convinced iâ€™m dying and really struggling to stay afloat.

I knew I'd be useless today and I really should have informed my colleagues of this. Instead, I kept my phone in another room (didn't touch it all day as if it was radioactive or something), kept it on silent and continued to cry for a bit. Eventually took an SOS pill and fell asleep.

"I've been feeling really healthy lately, in a not manic way. The only mania I've felt is when I went overboard on caffeine, and it only lasted for a few hours. 

But one of my essential changes is switching from abilify to vraylar. The former made my brain feel like Swiss cheese. The latter, I barely notice, yet my mood is stable.

Yesterday, my insurance decided to stop covering it without prior authorization, even though they approved it for the last month+. So I had to download a coupon. They want me back on abilify, even though I'm one of the rare people whose memory gets shredded, gains 60 lbs, and loses all self esteem thinking that his brain is useless. 

As y'all know, vraylar is very expensive. I have a coupon, but I have no idea whether I'll have to change medications when it expires. I'm very scared to try anything new, because what happens if it's exactly the same as abilify? I'm supposed to be denied disability, and working jobs wherein I still feel useless, all because my insurance doesn't care whether or not my brain works? 

I'm on the lowest dose of vraylar, and it's perfect! With all of this tomfoolery by my insurance, I'm getting it refilled, but it's still unusually expensive, and I have to skip a dose.

"So I've been learning a lot about myself recently and I wanted to document what I've learned so far and get feedback.

Given the stigma attached to mental health (that is only recently even being talked about) the words we use to talk about ourselves and others need to be clear, careful, and respectful. 

I think using ""bipolar"" as a noun (""look at that bipolar over there!"") is probably something we should discourage. But it's really hard to get by without a noun to describe ourselves, so we gotta come up with something.

""People suffering from bipolar"" doesn't sound much better to me. I read a study that said something to the effect of ""negative genetic diseases like schizophrenia, bipolar, or autism"". I had never been called a genetic disease before and I'm sure schizophrenic people and autistic people wouldn't appreciate that either. I think of this as a genetic predisposition that significantly raises the probability that you act in a way that seems ""crazy"" to others. But everyone, and I mean everyone, can be pushed into hypomania and then mania (""he just snapped!"") with enough stress.

""Living with bipolar"" doesn't sounds better, but still not great.

""The Bipolar community"" sounds pretty formal but might be the least worst option.

""They are Bipolar Type 1"" or ""I am Bipolar Type 2"" sounds pretty good but is still kinda a mouthful.

What do you think? 

These are more of the formal definitions...if I've gotten anything wrong here, please respond in the comments

Bipolar Spectrum - a dimension by which all people can be measured (i.e. everyone is on here somewhere)

Bipolar Type 1
Bipolar Type 2
Bipolar NOS (Not Other Specified)
Normal Person (vast majority of people)
Unipolar Depression (Major Depressive Disorder)

Bipolar Type 1 people experience cycles of major depression and mania.

Bipolar Type 2 people experience cycles of major depression and hypomania.

Mania = Hypomania (Turned to 11) + Psychosis

Psychosis is seeing things that aren't there (hallucinations, delusions, etc.)

Hypomania has the following diagnostic criteria in the DSM-IV-TR:

&gt;The DSM-IV-TR defines a hypomanic episode as including, over the course of at least four days, elevated mood plus three of the following symptoms OR irritable mood plus four of the following symptoms, when the behaviors are clearly different from how the person typically acts when not depressed:

* pressured speech
* inflated self-esteem or grandiosity
* decreased need for sleep
* flight of ideas or the subjective experience that thoughts are racing
* easily distracted
* increase in goal-directed activity (e.g., social activity, at work, or hypersexuality), or psychomotor agitation
* involvement in pleasurable activities that may have a high potential for negative psycho-social or physical consequences (e.g., the person engages in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, reckless driving, physical and verbal conflicts, foolish business investments, quitting a job to pursue some grandiose goal, etc.).[20]

"I get really angry about things that are honestly warranted to be angry about. I don't think I get angry over nothing. But I don't know how to control it or properly vent about it. I feel like other people get to vent and be angry and annoyed at things but when I do they see me as violent or crazy or delusional. I understand now though that when I'm having an episode I take it too far. But it fuels a lot of paranoia and delusions that people are talking about me (they probably are sometimes) and that they're conspiring things against me. And even though I'm told they're delusions and understand that on a logical level there's another part of me that keeps thinking those delusions and can't tell if it's a delusion or real.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I've never physically or financially hurt anyone in a serious manner nor have I ever had any power to do that. Emotionally I'm sure I've hurt people, but I don't get the same forgiveness that I give when others hurt me. And when people physically and financially hurt me or hurt me in ways that jeopardize my safety it's deemed as fine by others because people think of me as crazy already. I make the same mistakes over and over again and I can't stop and I hate it. And I don't think I'll ever get better.",bipolar_disorder
"Just an insert: My medication regimen is new and still very low dose and I can feel myself slipping. I can't call my doctor until Monday (it's Saturday morning here). I'm certain I can make it til then, but I am suffering. I have my partner watching me and my therapist on speed dial, so I'm kinda just looking for some distraction.

My biggest struggle is my anxiety and paranoia. Do y'all have any good tips to get my mind off it? I struggle to play video games but might give them a chance if it's story heavy with easy mode lol.

"My sweet husband had a BP 1 manic episode with psychosis earlier this week :( It resulted in hospitalization. He seems to have snapped out of it now, but is feeling very bored at the hospital. I asked the staff to help in find relaxing or supportive activities... but I'm trying to think of ideas I could suggest to him. I'm worried that he will slip back into a funk if he's too unhappy before they release him (hopefully on Monday).

Can anyone recommend things they've done during hospital stays that wound up helping. I was trying to think of something ""productive"" he could do since I know he feels helpless that he can't get back to his life. Though... in his manic states, he tends to hallucinate that he's working on a big project or mission, so don't want to trigger that either. Maybe something artistic?

"Earlier this year, my therapist had assessed me and diagnosed me with BP 2. She shared her findings with my psychiatrist who then recognized that I would respond well to medication. However, due to my job and current life, officially being diagnosed and receiving treatment would disqualify me from my current position, when I shared that with her she told me she would keep it off my record and that i donâ€™t have to medicate if i didnâ€™t want to but she recommends against it. Mostly, I donâ€™t feel as if i am truly bipolar. I had always chocked it up to my personality, i am naturally impulsive, irritable at times (especially when sleep deprived), and seek some risks but again i feel like iâ€™ve always just craved getting a new piercing when i felt like i needed to. However, i currently think i am manic. I thought about a new piercing and just had to get it within the next hour. And sexually, iâ€™ve been impulsive and almost idk dirty? i canâ€™t best explain it, but normally iâ€™m more reserved and donâ€™t care for attention but lately iâ€™ve been seeking it out, sending dirty pics to multiple men etc. and it just feels very unlike me. i am also finishing up some schooling and i havenâ€™t participated in the last week, i just feel like i donâ€™t care about it rn even tho iâ€™ve always been a great student.

"Hey everyone, initial bipolar borderline differential diagnosis, 6 months proud bipolar disorder owner here. What I can remember from the consequences, I can say I've had 4 major manic episodes till today, this consists of the last 2 years or so in total. So just a short backstory here, 23 year old female, mom also bipolar. I used to have major depression, or that's what they thought idk. Back in one of my manic episodes I became an escort to pay for the drugs I wanted to use, what I'm guessing from back then I got HPV. Got the warts removed by surgical excision 3 days ago. Doctor said to wait 2 weeks before having sex but I could only go one. So yesterday, I was with a guy with whom I'm planning on getting into my first gangbang, and when I offered to send the videos we took of us fking with my full face visible I realized something must be wrong. It was just for a second, I asked myself what I was doing. Immediately contacted my psychotherapist and let him know about what I have been doing for the past couple of days and my sleep schedule etc. He said it seems that I'm manic atm, gave me a few directives and told me to talk to my psychiatrist, but the guy costs a lot of money and I just used up all mine to get condoms and lube for the gangbang (protection is not for free or cheap in my country unfortunately). I sent the videos btw, to the guy for him to show his friends, so we'd be able to convince them to get into the gangbang with us. I don't care though, I am aware that I'm doing some dangerous shit but I couldn't give any less fucks idk. Is it possible to become aware that you're going through a manic episode but still do whatever it urges you to do? Or am I just plain fking stupid or sth?",bipolar_disorder

"I (24F) am BP-1 and recently started seeing a new psychiatrist and he is the best mental health professional Iâ€™ve had so far. He is kind, patient, funny, really listens to me and takes into consideration what I want in terms of my treatment and medications. However, he is also very young and handsome and i have been feeling pretty strong sexual attraction towards him to the point where Iâ€™m constantly having sex dreams about him. Im not in love with him or anything, it is 100% purely sexual but really intense. Im super worried about what to do now because itâ€™s fine now while im at baseline and itâ€™s only a fantasy. But my mania makes me extremely hypersexual and i have zero control of myself when manic . Im super paranoid about becoming manic and making a pass at him/saying something inappropriate, which would mean finding another doctor and ive been through so many already and he is great so i want to keep seeing him. 

I dont know whether or not to just be honest with him because 1) im super embarrassed of myself and 2) im scared if i tell him that it would ruin our professional relationship and make things awkward and i end up on the hunt for a new doctor again.

Has anyone ever experienced attraction to a mental health professional?? Is it normal?? How did you cope with it??

"Arranging metaphors on my relation to Bipolar Disorder II and anxiety disorder helps me in my quest for healing. I decided to share my morning realisation. Maybe it will help some of you, maybe it won't. We all have different experiences, be we never know.   
(English is not my native language, hope this writing make sense despite that).

Here it goes:

I sometimes feel like Iâ€™m trapped in a cell with my evil vampire twin.  

The sun seldom shines through the bars, though when it does, it keeps him away, giving me a moment rest.  

But most of the times, I feel threatened by my twinâ€™s ability to suck life out of me. I canâ€™t really put the blame on him, as he doesnâ€™t do it out of spite for me, itâ€™s just in his nature.  

Nonetheless, I often feel alone in this cage, hopeless in this continuous fight. People can only shine their torchlight in the dark to find me. They canâ€™t see the presence hiding in the dark. Perhaps they get a glimpse of his shadow preying upon me. Yet, theyâ€™re not in the cell with me, no one will ever be.  

And I donâ€™t want them to be, itâ€™s not a burden I wish to share. I keep the cell locked, so this dark side of mine never harms others. I feel guilty when it does though. 

I want to get out, but I know that the solution is not in the flight, life and therapy taught me that. The issue is not in the cage, itâ€™s in my relationship with my twin. Itâ€™s an animal I must tame, even get friends with, love him till he understands that he is the one trapped with me. Medication is useless if itâ€™s not paired with my trying to understand why heâ€™s there and how we can live together.  

Iâ€™ve tried so many times to get rid of him with any substances and entertainment I could get my hands on. All that Iâ€™ve achieved is to strengthen and enrage him. 

Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that my psychologist was right all along: it will always be a part of me, I can only find a way to live in harmony with him. Iâ€™ve accepted the truth for a long time now. It doesnâ€™t make things easier, but I can move forward now on.  

I wish everyone here to find the path to acceptance and the peace that comes with it. And I congratulate all who achieved that. 

Have a great day everyone, may the sun shine through your cell!",bipolar_disorder

.Medicines(It's like the medcines which I take i e 500my epival 5mg Olanzapine have number my emotions and general motivation not sure about that but my gut feeling says so)

"So I started a new job 6 months ago after being unemployed on disability for 12 years and I'm finding it incredibly difficult. The biggest issue I have is motivation to keep on showing up knowing full well how difficult I'm going to find the shift. 

Everyday all I think about is how much I want to give up and quit, to go back to the easier life of disability where I can focus purely on my mental health without having to worry about the added stress of a job. 

When I first started I thought having a job would help take my mind off things by keeping me active, getting me out the house etc but now the initial buzz of getting a job has worn off, I've realised just how hard it is to hold down a job.

When I was 16 I started talking to this guy on tumble dot corn who was 5 years older than me and we started dating long distance after I turned 17 and before we even started dating he tried to convince me to live with him in Toronto lol. He was the only one who ~got me ~ and was my only real emotional support as a queer kid living in Alabama and we got engaged when I was 18 and I moved up there immediately after graduating high school and a month before we were supposed to get married he ended things and I moved back (after two weeks of continuing to live with him haha). And that triggered a whole cascade of mental health bullshit including psychotic depression and my first hypomanic episode and the whole deal

Okay flash forward to me at 26 having my first hypomanic episode in years and using that fucking confidence boost to message him finally to get Closureâ„¢ï¸ and he gave a really sincere apology and I was like yeah okay cool I finally dealt with this garbage hanging over my head for almost a decade

Flash forward to 27 and my sister in law who lives with me and is now 20 admits that sheâ€™s been having a friends with benefits kinda romantic thing with a man who is 10 years older than her who she started talking to really intensely when she was an emotionally isolated 17 year old and it. Has really fucked me up. Found out in august or September I think? Been dealing with it in therapy bc apparently it takes more than a quick fb messenger exchange to get over the most traumatic experience of your life 

But Iâ€™m still not really recovered at all in al day the opposite because my wonderful therapist helped me validate that this was a actual real legitimate trauma and not me blowing things out of proportion but  that means that Iâ€™m really feeling it for real. And Taylor swiftâ€™s Midnights which I really enjoy does have a song on it that just hits really fucking hard bc itâ€™s exactly how Iâ€™ve been feeling.

"So Iâ€™ve known my girlfriends best friend for about 3 years. She was awesome at the beginning of our friendship, but things started to spiral around 6 months into the friendship. She would constantly start drama with me, and get her boyfriend to the point where he would be mad at me for almost nothing. She would make narcissistic comments, talk about how everyone had a crush on her. She always acted better than everyone. She had no respect for anyone other than herself. She has called me every name under the sun, and I sat there and would grin and bear it. I have always apologized first, and apologized for things that I never did in the wrong in the first place. Iâ€™d apologize for her mess ups. Iâ€™d apologize for her behavior, her words, and her actions. I felt worthless, belittled, berated, and hurt. This was supposed to be someone I could trust.

Zoom forward the July of this year. I met her best friend, and she was the complete opposite of her. Super considerate, kind, and such a bright soul to be around. Positivity just ebbed out of this girl. I fell in love with her, and we immediately clicked. I still have issues with the best friend from the previous writings. She has started talking to this girl, starting problems in our relationship, and stressing out my girlfriend and I, to the point where I get so angry I canâ€™t stop lashing out. Recently I decided to block her, and it was the best decision I have made for my mental health in a long while.

"I'm still very religious and believe very deeply. Though I have a much different relationship with God and religion than I use to. One thing I'm realizing though is how much of it was bipolar disorder. The extreme passion to complete burn out I'd bounce back and forth on and struggled with so much more than others and could never understand why. Because it wasn't real authentic belief or relationship. It's was mania.

The strange part is realizing how many YEARS of my life I spent sharing my experiences with others trying to get them to experience those same life changing things I had because they were the most amazing thing in the world. I was trying to get people to experienc manic episodes...... I spent years proselytizing essentially for bipolar disorder. Because realistically the thing I had experienced and I was trying to get people to encounter for themselves was actually manic episodes.

*Please do not turn this into a debate on religion in the comments. I'm still religious yes, but I'm not here to push it on anyone. I'm just sharing this experience because I know a lot of us have complicated experiences with religion and mania. This is a place where having believed you were actually a god at some point it's a pretty common shared experience. Everyone should feel welcome to discuss their experiences and how bipolar has effected them. No one should tell someone else what they believe or don't believe is wrong. Or determine for them their religious experiences were from bipolar disorder and not authentic.

And when I left for work- still not hydrated by any means- I somehow passed out for the tiniest pinprick of a moment, and came to driving my car through successive fence posts.

It's starting to get bad again, after my doctor moved states and the one I have reversed his change. He had told me that if I didn't switch my buspar down to a prescribed lower dose, he'd drop me as a patient. Now the NP taking over is like, ""What? Nahh, it's all fine. Go back up to that dose.""

"Went to the doc today for a follow up after increasing my antidepressant (Trintellix) 6 weeks ago. Iâ€™ve been on Abilify for about 2 years and it stopped (what I thought was) a manic episode but my depression has run rampant so she put me on Trintellix and the plan was to go up to 20mg today 

BUT INSTEAD she says that I might not be bipolar after all as I havenâ€™t had a manic episode since Iâ€™ve seen her (2 years).  I ask her if itâ€™s okay to come off of abilify then (my med list is starting to pile up) and she said no. Instead she wants to try a new mood stabilizer (Latuda) while Iâ€™m still on Abilify. I donâ€™t get it.

Is this normal? If Iâ€™m not bipolar why would I need to be on a mood stabilizerâ€¦ or 2 even.",bipolar_disorder
"I am interested to see if anyone has had similar thoughts/experiences involving family.  When I go into manic episodes, I always circle back to the thought that no one in my family respects me because I am mentally ill. I get the feeling that they all walk on eggshells around me, which is heartbreaking. The way they talk and interact with one another is not how they interact with me. I am not sure if this is because they think I'm crazy and look down on me, or if they are just being sensitive to my condition. This has led me to lose a lot of trust with them and has strained our relationships.  Earlier today I told my father that I don't trust my siblings and will see them all at their funerals and he started crying.  I have already decided that I am not going home for the holidays this year because every time I go home I have a mental breakdown and leave thinking that I'm different then everyone. I never had a close relationship with them to begin with, but I wish I did. I am diagnosed and medicated for Bipolar II disorder and I am concerned that there may also be a bit of schizophrenia or psychosis involved.

"**TL;DR: How do I ask for a permanent WFH situation without disclosing too many details about my bipolar diagnosis to my employer?**

With a lot more companies pushing back to office initiatives recently, Iâ€™m sure many of us with jobs that allowed remote work are nervous about how the transition back to office and how it will affect our symptoms.

Iâ€™m in this situation right now - I work at an advertising agency as a manager. I was hired as a remote employee in March, so Iâ€™m fairly new to the company, but itâ€™s been a great place to work and I like the small team I work with. My job has no benefit to being in the office as the clients are in another country.

The agency started requiring us to return to the office 2 days a week until for now, then transition to 4 days a week in January. 

Personally, remote working has been great for my mental health and has helped control my moods and allowed me to do better work. I have medications that I need to take throughout the day and I donâ€™t want to have to bring them to the office.

I asked months ago to arrange a permanent remote work situation, but I was told to just â€œhang tightâ€ until they required us to go back, then ask for the arrangement.

Now that they are requiring it, HR has been completely unresponsive to my requests. Thereâ€™s no form to fill out, they want me to have a meeting with someone from HR and explain why I need a permanent WFH arrangement.

Iâ€™ve had a bad experience with another company using my diagnosis against me, so I absolutely do not want to disclose it to my employer if at all possible.

Can I say I have a chronic illness? Will I need more explanation? I did disclose that I had a disability when I was hired, but didnâ€™t elaborate. Iâ€™m being treated by both a psychiatrist and therapist
 and they agreed to vouch for me if necessary.

"Just to state, since itâ€™s my first post here, Iâ€™m a 22 years old woman diagnosed with anxiety, bipolar disorder and BPD. My first diagnosis was on 2018. Even before I harmed myself but my situation only kept getting worst. Psychiatrists, therapists, other doctors, pills, ERs and psychiatric wardsâ€¦ I canâ€™t do it anymore so after my last hospitalization im August of this year, I decided to just take my pills and swallow everything else. Be an adult. Work (which one of my doctors was against). But thatâ€™s bullshit. Iâ€™m exhausted. I donâ€™t even have time for therapy other than talking to one of my doctors over messages every now and then. I finally broke down a little while ago and ever since my days consist on working on automatic, pretend Iâ€™m okay and spend my nights either with alcohol or cry myself to sleep while fighting the urge of harming myself. And you must understand how it drains our energies to resist the temptation. 

â€œIn the documentary I watched today, when Selena gets diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she was discussing with her manager if she wants to tell people about it or not. And something she said is stuck on my mind: â€œlike- what? Like, certain people or directors or something may not wanna work with me? But then why would I wanna work with them anyway?â€. And then I remember when I was in HS, I used to talk to the school therapist and sheâ€™d ask me: â€œWhy do you keep apologizing?â€.

And now it hit meâ€¦ Iâ€™m tired of apologizing for who I am. For how I feel, as fucked up as these feelings and emotions can be. Iâ€™m tired of apologizing for things that arenâ€™t my choice or the traumas and mental issues. I didnâ€™t ask to have the combo of anxiety, bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.

Truth is: Iâ€™m scared to be lonely because of all these issues and traumas I developed growing up in a fucked up environment. No one, no matter how close to me, knows what I have to deal with. They wouldnâ€™t survive a day with my mind. None of them lives and feels what I do. And I know Iâ€™m hard to deal with. I acknowledge that. But it doesnâ€™t mean that I have to be with people, even if I like them, if I canâ€™t be myself. I do enough pretending to be fine while drinking to cope with my thoughts, crying myself to sleep (if I do) and fighting everyday the urge of harming myself. 

My point is: I like you, x, but I love myself. If I have to keep worrying about what Iâ€™m gonna say or how will I act, overthinking and afraid of the response, then Iâ€™d rather suffer alone. Youâ€™re a nice guy but you donâ€™t want me entirely, with all my issues. And I donâ€™t want you because of that. Because as much as is hard to deal with everything I deal with on my own, is even harder when I have to worry and fear how the other person will react as well. 

All of this is actually for myself. 

I need to put all of this on my mind.

I would be unfair to both of us if I kept apologizing for my feelings and try to act on automatic. All serious and like an only rational person. I donâ€™t want to have to suppress my feelings with my partner.

You mentioned having healthy and unhealthy ways to heal your inner child. If it was that simple, I wouldnâ€™t have any issues. I would know how to cope with my issues in a healthy way. But itâ€™s not that simple. I donâ€™t have this control. At least I wonâ€™t have it until some point after allowing my inner child out. 

Well, this thesis was wrote by a very rational (and, at the moment, stable) adult. Which is what you need 24/7. Iâ€™m not this person. 

I wanna feel and react without faking or holding back any emotions and live afraid of the response. 

You wanted rational, here is rational. Iâ€™m swallowing my emotions. But Iâ€™m so fucking tired of doing so.â€",bipolar_disorder

"Hi bipolar reddit, I'm just really tired. I've been struggling my entire university career, and even when finally being diagnosed and treated for bipolar in 2021, I'm really struggling to finish university. I was supposed to be class of 2022 but I withdrew for that year to take time off to get better. This fall and spring semester was supposed to be my make it year but I'm failing this fall semester. I genuinely feel hopeless. I really don't think more time off will help me, in part because all of my support system has graduated and left/will be leaving by next year. I feel like there's nothing left for me here where I am at university. I just want to graduate and move on with my life because I can't handle the school environment anymore but I can't. I'm just so so upset because I've done every single possible thing throughout university to make life easier for myself (transferring schools, taking summer classes every single summer to reduce workload over semesters, seeking accommodations, finally seeking mental health providers) and I'm still failing and unable to finish college. I don't know what to do anymore, I don't think I will ever be able to be functional enough to live like the rest of the world does. ):",bipolar_disorder
"I'm posting different versions of this, in 3 different subs for different necessary perspectives.

First off: I'm definitely not manic. This isn't impulse-driven. It's shitty childhood-driven. It's something I think of over and over, but am so afraid to try for it, because *what if I'm not good enough to do it?* What if I hurt them, traumatize them? Can I even be stable enough to do it?

I know every tiny little infinitesimal sign that I'm heading toward mania. I know my indicators of depression. When something skews weird, I call my doctor ASAP. The one time we were playing phone-tag for too long, I went to the hospital. I take my meds: morning and night, every day.

My motivation is basically this: My parents were shitty, neglectful assholes who treated me like a 50 year old bag of leaky dumpster fluid. I will never have that parental love or affection.

But I can give it. And I really, *really* want to give that.

And then my worry from the past year is involved: I went on Lamictal when I was 10, and it worked like a charm. But last year, I was off some of my medication because I couldn't afford it (lamictal wasn't one of the ones I was out of yet). I called around and found somewhere to go to get back on my medication safely. Except without asking me whether or not it was working, or any questions to assess if it was, this total quack took me off that and 2 other meds cold turkey. After about a week, the anger began to show. ***And I had no fucking clue what to do.***

It was like the behavior controls had just *vanished*. I was quick to be irritated, aggravated, and to anger. I was *really fucking glad* when I found empathy would yank me out of that anger spiral. Weirdest example is when a stray shopping cart almost hit a car in a parking lot I was parked in- just snapped me right on out of it. And I was never violent from it either. It took more than 6 months to get back to my proper dose (400mg- I'm actually still not there, but that's just because I stabilized at a lower dose after *half a damn year*).

In that time, I met someone who was in a similar abusive situation I had been in with my mom. I did my level best to help him get out, and offered him a place to stay for free. I'd been in that insane tornado that is getting away- for me I ended up homeless the first 4 months of lockdown. I couldn't just resign someone to it. I told him what steps he needed to take to get out safely, and when the time came I picked him up from the train station.

But I was *still* nowhere near the dose I needed to be on. I would yell and scream (not really at him, just trying to get all the awful out), but you could definitely call my behavior abusive. And this is really fucking with me, because I *needed* that medication. It *wasn't my choice* to go off it, and I did everything I could to get back on it. But I also don't want to make excuses about it!

I want to be able to do this for someone, but I *don't* want to make them worse.

 My thought has sort of been, that since I would have to have at least a 2 bedroom apartment, I'll have to work toward having the physical ability to do this anyway. So maybe I should talk to a therapist? Or maybe to like a family/ child psychologist, to make certain I'm fit to do this. I already know that when something else is dependent on me, I work harder, am more punctual, and generally care about what's happening. But last I checked, children were not literal guinea pigs; so there's more to consider. 

Y'all, I need your honest perspective. I don't want to be a monster in someone else's nightmares, like my parents are for me.",bipolar_disorder
"I am still learning about being bipolar. I think I am in the beginning of being manic. It really is a love hate thing. I love that I feel more awake and energized but I hate the anxiety that takes over, feelings of regret, and irritability. I havenâ€™t even done anything to feel bad though. So, I donâ€™t know why I feel that way anyways. I feel like I donâ€™t know what to do with myself and just wish I felt calmer. Not sure if this rant makes a lot of sense.

I've been extremely depressed and feeling very defeated as far as diagnoses and treatment trials for mental health. I know this isn't healthy but right now I don't really care. I should probably check myself in somewhere.

My psychiatrist took away my bipolar diagnosis but says I still have bipolar symptoms but the persistent depressive symptoms are likely due to ptsd. He wants to try me on an ssri. I'm terrified but I told him I'm willing to try it. I just don't want to mess up the things I have going for me by going into a bad manic episode again. I'm supposed to do all this therapy and it seems like too much work.

I have a stash of a certain medication and haven't taken any meds for the past week because swallowing pills just feels like too much effort.

I don't know who I am or what I want and feel a general apathy towards everyone and everything and I hate it. I see no future. But I know I can't do anything because it would destroy my loved ones. So for now, I'm just here. I hope some of you understand.

"Hello, my psychiatrist isnâ€™t 100% sure if Iâ€™ve got bipolar or ADHD, I think Iâ€™m leaning more towards bipolar but does it sound like it?

I hope I donâ€™t offend anyone by this post Iâ€™m still trying to understand it but what are your mania episodes like? Do they always end up in hospitalisation? (sorry if I sound stupid!)

When I think Iâ€™m manic I havenâ€™t done any dangerous behaviour but I have a lot more energy, I am a very positive person and Iâ€™m a lot more chatty to people I know and people I donâ€™t know. Im up for socialising and making plans to socialise. I like to drink. I donâ€™t sleep much and it feels like my brain is going 100mph, I also get auditory hallucinations and Iâ€™m irritable. I also seem to have no filter and say what I think which can end up upsetting people. I still go to work and I can still do my job but I still have all this energy, irritability, no filter etc as mentioned. This can last 10 days to a few weeks then I CRASH! 

Oh my mood drops so bad. I am so low and have thoughts of self harm &amp; suicide (when Iâ€™m up, these are very far from my mind I couldnâ€™t imagine myself wanting to do this) and I think about it all the time. I have little to no energy. I struggle to get out of bed and function I literally take it hour by hour. Iâ€™m tearful, and I have PTSD and my symptoms of this can come out then too, I also have anxiety and canâ€™t leave the house. Donâ€™t want to see friends and cancel all plans. Very negative self image and Iâ€™m tearful etc.

Iâ€™m currently medicated, Iâ€™m taking lofepramine and quetiapine they seem to be helping. My psychs view is them meds help with ADHD and Bipolar so whichever one it is hopefully the meds will help.

Does this sound like bipolar? Iâ€™ve never been hospitalised due to an episode has anyone else not been? I have been hospitalised due to SH and suicide attempts though. I just want a diagnosis from my psych really at least I know when where Iâ€™m at.

"Hi! 

Until recently, I was on Vraylar, and had been for the last two years. With insurance flipping over with the new year and our deductible not being met, my co-pay went from $60 to over $1k. This wasâ€¦ not ideal, or affordable for me, being a college student, so I called my psych and let her know was was going on- they scheduled me for about a month out and I spent that time completely off my meds, cold turkey.

That itself was awful. I told my psych that I wanted to try a mood stabilizer that was not an anti psychotic, like Lamictal, but she warned me it may take up to a month to take affect and then it may not work, and I was already behind in class due to being majorly depressed, so I agreed to go on Abilify and then try to add in Lamictal after a couple weeks.

Itâ€™s been mostly fine! Howeverâ€¦

I had some wine with dinner a couple nights in the past few weeks. I felt fine. And then I would go to sleepâ€¦

Multiple times in the night Iâ€™d wake up to bile making its way up my throat. I havenâ€™t actually vomited in about 15 years, so this was a surprise. I never actually threw up, but I kept waking up gagging and feeling awful.

"Iâ€™m not going to end up going, but just to take you through what I experience and many of you know as a manic episode, you can literally convince yourself of being able to do anything. 

When the mania strikes you feel like a superhero, like you could do the impossible. Sometimes it just happens especially after a long depressive episode it feels almost like a long lost friend. That lingering shred of the ability to actually do something beside being down is so in grasp. 

Then it goes too far.

Whatâ€™s happening in Ukraine is fucked up, obviously. But when you feel like a superhero you (or myself personally) feel the obsessive need to help others. and then sometimes you set yourself on fire to keep others warm. You get depressed about not being able to help, and then there you go, youâ€™re back down into depression.

This is why itâ€™s important to spot when things can go too far, so you can keep balance. I have the privilege of being with someone who can talk me down from these feelings, but I know most of you are not as lucky. 

I hope this at least helps one person settle down from any kind of mania they are feeling. Remember the most important things to breaking mania cycles.

My soon to be ex-husband had attempted to kill himself in front of me with a gun and chose to ignore that situation. He made me nervous to point I had fled in the middle of the night. He destroyed my most precious things and filed for divorce. I lost my job, my friends, my house, my life as I knew it. I was hit by someone and lost my car completely, one I have to pay off still. I lost my mom's side of the family again and that's just the tip of the iceberg.. Shit has been so hard. I'm fighting my husband in court, I'm losing my independence on a level I've never known....I ended up in the hospital for alcohol withdrawals in the midst of a delusional episode. I'm sober now.
When I started my new job(I work on a higher level in the Healthcare field)...I knew from past experience that manic episodes often start when I start a new job. I have far too much on my plate and I knew that mania would be a dangerous thing for me. Things have gotten worse in the past week responsibility wise for my divorce, my car, bills etc.
I can't sleep regardless of meds, I have been in close contact with my doctors throughout this whole ordeal. I've maybe slept 7 hours in the whole week, I have lost 6.5 lbs and I'm not hungry at all.

I was VERY vocal about my concerns, maybe too vocal and also have been hypomanic. So it seemed like they used every opportunity they had to write me up and then eventually fire me. I had been taking pictures and videos of things and have been sending them to the dept of health and safety and OSHA.

"For sake of context; i have friends that i have grown close to over the years. One trait that most of us all share is having ptsd from all different kinds of abuse-- the other is an overt narcissist that fails to mask and seek consistent therapy.

With that said, my gut tells me to keep my mouth shut, though; there are times when my control slips and my rage, or boredom gets the best of me. Theyve seen some of it, luckly not the full extent.

"Iâ€™ve been seeing this guy casually for the last month and heâ€™s great and we mesh very well. But lately Iâ€™ve been trying to distance myself from him but also keep finding myself sharing life stuff in normal conversation. I keep wanting to tell myself to back away from especially after he told me of his plan to move to a different state (that Iâ€™m not interested in living in) within the next couple of years.

The relationship shot off like fireworks in the beginning with me being manic and excited and talkative and energetic and now Iâ€™m in a low period and I feel myself shutting people out and wanting to push him away. I feel like Iâ€™m an all or nothing person at heart and Iâ€™m tired of being hurt and hurting myself. Maybe Iâ€™m not thinking clearly because Iâ€™m not in a good mood but I almost feel like ghosting him. 

I hate feeling like Iâ€™m too much or say too much in conversation. Even though Iâ€™ve discussed my illness and the way I am with him and he was very supportive I still canâ€™t push away the idea that Iâ€™m overbearing and difficult.

"Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) recently and wanted to know if this is a manic/hypomanic episode that Iâ€™m going through, and if so, how to stop.
About two weeks ago, a new guy from work (42m) gave me (23f) his number. Heâ€™s attractive but I didnâ€™t consider myself attracted to him. I had no intention of actually texting him but here we are two weeks later and weâ€™ve made out/talked dirty. I stopped myself from sleeping with the guy because heâ€™s married and I have a boyfriend (considered that a victory lol). I somewhat came to my senses and told the guy that this isnâ€™t right so he backed off. However a coworker started shamelessly flirting with him and it turned me on when he told me about it, so I started getting flirty again too. Some weird game I know heâ€™s playing but I like. My libido has been so high, like crazy high. Iâ€™ve been sleeping with my boyfriend everyday to satisfy the itch. I even called out one day and pleasured myself all morning that day. 
I feel really good though, self-esteem wise. Feel like Iâ€™m glowing, Iâ€™ve been dressing up because I figure why not. My appetite hasnâ€™t been raging the way it usually does too so Iâ€™ve been feeling thinner. People around me have noticed that Iâ€™ve been more upbeat but they donâ€™t question it because theyâ€™re used to my sulking lol.

"Last year I got diagnosed with adhd and anxiety and got put on concerta and Prozac. And it helped somewhat but Iâ€™m still experiencing what I think might be hypomania. 

For example yesterday at a field day type event at school I was extremely energetic and irritable. I talked to random people and was loud, shouting and confrontational. I was arguing with classmates over a competition I didnâ€™t even care about before. 

My friends later that night pointed out that it was strange and I couldnâ€™t see it. I started arguing with them and threatening them just because they said that. They started trying to check up on me and I blocked them all because I thought they were trying to treat me like I was crazy. I wake up this morning and I realize that I was in the wrong and I donâ€™t even understand why I felt like that. 

I also have random episodes of depression that last for varying period of time. Like last week I started crying on the bus and was convinced everyone hated me and I should kill myself. Then three days later I talk to my friends again and realized they never did. 

Iâ€™m just using recent examples but this has been going on since i was in the 5th grade and Iâ€™m a senior now.

Been scrolling through here and the personal testimonies are resonating with me. They all seem to explain my situation. I donâ€™t know what to do to though. I donâ€™t want everyone to think Iâ€™m crazy or put me in a ward or something if I tell them I think Iâ€™m bipolar.",bipolar_disorder

Anyhow, ive had some weird realisation since coming out of it, that actually im a really shitty person.

I literally convinced myself certain things were true when i was manic and iâ€™m now living in the shadows of those delusions/lies.

It didn't help with anything except knock me out. I still get offended the thc oil every month and they truly believe its better than my psych meds. They drive me to my appointments but still make snark comments about psychiatry and how its bad for me to be dependent on medication. When I literally just got my latest psych screening coming up with BP1 and OCD so far. I am still getting screen for other disorders. Its honestly so tiring. I can't implement them into my safety plan because who knows if they'll actually take me to hospital if I need it. I have friends and distant family on it who do believe in this suff.

Just on one google search I found three credible scientific sources for this news, and there are loads more.

In short, bipolar disorder burns out the telomere strands on the ends of your chromosomes so that you age faster, die years earlier than you would have, and suffer cognitive decline earlier.

The upside is that lithium compensates for this and has been shown to save the telomeres in clinical trials, which is the big good news.

"Just a story...

My first job was as a busboy and dishwasher at age 17. At that time, I hadn't yet been diagnosed as bipolar, but in hindsight I can now see that I was having symptoms before that. After a while I started getting trained as a prep cook, and then became a line cook. 

When I'd have episodes of mania, it felt like I was really enjoying work. I'd get praise from everyone for getting so much done. And then I'd eventually fall into depression and get really frustrated that I was't enjoying anything. I'd justify it by telling myself I'd done such a good job before that it was fine if I called out sick because I somehow deserved to. I thought I was just burning myself out. 

Around 19, I got introduced to painkillers by my coworkers. Mostly vicodin and percocet at first. But then oxycontin started getting really popular and it became an everyday thing. 40 bucks for a single pill seemed absolutely insane to me at first, but then once I understood the high, I remember thinking I'd probably even pay more. Before that I had only really drank alcohol and smoked weed a little. I didn't know what withdrawals were at the time. All I knew is that if I didn't have the drug, I felt like shit. So I just thought I needed them. 

Wasn't long after that, I got introduced to cocaine. I felt like I was coasting.Â  Everything was all good now, I didn't have those days where I felt like I couldn't do anything anymore. I wasn't having any episodes of depression because I was self medicating. To be honest, it actually worked pretty well for a long time. 

But eventually, I crashed. And I crashed HARD. I was suddenly completely suicidal, and it scared me. I fell into such deep depression that I just stopped going to work. I didn't even call out, just didn't show up. I didn't want to speak to anyone. I didn't eat or even get out of bed for days. 

Little did I know, this experience was about to become a repeating pattern. 

For the next 9 years, I probably had about nearly 30 jobs. 99% of which were restaurant jobs. The longest I stayed at a job was a little over a year. And the shortest duration was probably about 2 weeks. I tries to keep things balanced by using cocaine when I was depressed, and opiates and beznodiazepines when I was too manic. Until I'd eventually have a depressive episode that'd cost me my job and have to start over. Everywhere I went seemed to be the same thing: pills (opiates, benzos, amphetamines), cocaine, and alcohol. I even had a boss that would inject ketamine daily, and if you've ever done ketamine then you understand what a ridiculous drug that is to be using at work. One time I was unknowingly dosed with LSD by a coworker during a shift. Things were out of control, and I couldn't escape it because cooking was the only thing I was experienced in. I tried to get other types of jobs but I just wasn't as good at anything else, they never worked out. 

In the midst of all this, I had eventually gotten educated about opiates. What withdrawals were, and how dangerous they can actually be. I got sick of being sick and was able to quit. Now looking back, it was a miracle I was able to do that. I honestly don't even know how I did it, I just stopped without any help. 

Sometime around my early to mid 20s, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My memory isn't so great, so I'm not sure exactly when. And it took a couple of different doctors to pinpoint it. I tried a lot of different medications that helped in different ways. But the cycles always repeated in some way. I had quite a few stretches of sobriety from illicit drugs and alcohol as well. I had a few admissions to psych wards, and also went a rehab a few times. 

My last kitchen job: I had a long stretch of sobriety and was very determined to stay straight and hold onto job. I ended up getting lucky by scoring a job at a pretty respectable restaurant. It was the first place I'd worked that was actually really organized, and the people there seemed like they had their lives together and knew what they were doing. There wasn't rampant drug use in the kitchen. There was some, but they weren't as open about it. 

I was on medication for bipolar disorder that was working pretty well for me at the time. I thought everything was gonna be cool from now on. I was making more money than I ever had, and was getting a ton of hours. I worked 6 days a week from 11am to midnight, sometimes a little later. Every week, I had a different day off. I wouldn't know what my day off was until I got the schedule for the week. Most people with bipolar disorder will tell you that sticking to a routine is an important part of preventing episodes, so this type of schedule was not ideal. 

I wasn't using any drugs during this time, but I was still very much struggling with impulses to use. Every night after work, I craved alcohol. Luckily, I got out of work so late that the liquor stores were always closed. And I'm not even sure how this became a thing at first, but the urge to drink turned into an urge to self harm. I started cutting myself. Before this, I didn't understand the whole ""cutting"" thing at all. I always thought the people that did that were just doing it for attention or something. But once I started, it was hard to stop. It was really satisfying, and I got a rush from it. After a week or two, my entire torso was covered in thin cuts. I kept it to places that no one could see. I didn't slice my skin, I'd stick the tip of the blade in and scrape open the skin, I guess because it hurt more that way. 

I started becoming very overwhelmed. I had this job for about 5 months before it came undone. My last 3 days of work at this place, I had a very intense manic episode. I worked 11am to midnight for 3 days with no sleep in between. I was also walking 2 miles each way to and from work since I didn't have a car. When I'd get home from work, I was so wired that I'd impulsively buy tons of things online. I pretty much spent all the money I had saved up. 

On the last day I worked there, I messed up a single order. My boss screamed at me for it and my mind felt like it was unraveling. I honestly wanted to stab the guy through the fucking heart, and considered it. My vision got blurry and my heart raced. But somehow I made it to the end of my shift. I got home and my mind raced. I fell into a horrible depression. I didn't go to work the next day. I didn't call out, I just shut my phone off and basically contemplated suicide for the next week or so. 

I had previously applied for disability about a year prior to all of this. But for some reason my case had been paused. I finally mustered up the motivation to call and got the ball rolling again. It took about another year until I was finally granted SSI. During which I lived with my father. I felt some relief for a little while, but now the amount of money I make in a month is what a used to almost make in a week. And everyone looks at me like I'm some lazy freeloader. It's extremely stressful being able to barely pay my rent and bills. And even though I have Medicare, I'm still often forced to go without my meds for at least a few days each month because I can't afford the co-pays. If I'm lucky, I can find someone trade money off my ebt in exchange for cash to pay for my meds. 

I really want to be able to work again. But I still have bipolar cycles and sometimes they get really bad. If I get a job while on SSI, my payments will be reduced. I'm afraid that if I do that, I will eventually lose the job and be stuck with less money from SSI. It's too much of a risk since I'm barely getting by as it is. 

I used to be in therapy and it helped a lot, but I can no longer afford it. That causes me anxiety because once I go up for review about my SSI, they'll see that I'm not in therapy and I'm not sure if that's grounds to deny me.

"as of this writing it is 1AM where i am. i started feeling really suspiciously good earlier this week. things were fine (and somewhat productive) until literally 3 hours ago. i managed to avoid buying $100s worth of stuff that i had the strong impulse to buy yesterday. i managed to not email a coworker volunteering for a project i don't have time for, and i managed to not buy tons of junky food when i was at the grocery store this morning. 

BUT

tonight after dinner, desert and cards i thought to myself: ""what if i try to fix my bike that has been messing up this week?""

this did not end well and i am now shaking and panicking. i felt so confident that i could do this right even though i have 0 experience with chain and brake repairs. i felt so good that i thought with only 30 seconds of youtube tutorial this was a feasible thing for me to do at 10:30PM. i was egged on by the success that i had removing the rust from the wheelset and chain. instead of a fixed bike i now have TWO unrideable fucked up bikes and i'm missing TWO very tiny pieces that went flying across the floor and probably are embedded in the weird carpet. i cleaned up nothing and am now having a Very Bad Timeâ„¢. i do not feel good now, but i still have the buzzy buzz energy. 

this is actually a serious problem ive caused myself because i have to be at work early tomorrow morning. the only transportation that i have to work is that bicycle. i cannot ride the bicycle. i have stained fingernails, clothes. i might have ruined the carpet and i left a huge mess. i don't think i can sleep and my thoughts are weird mix of anxiety, fury and energy. cant tell if im going down or im still up. maybe both somehow. 

my brain is racing and i can't really organize my thought i think. i fucked up and like always my knee jerk reaction to fucking up is ""what if i die?"". like im not going to do it. i haven't seriously wanted to do it since i was in college. but the tool is still there and i can't throw it out. 

is fury bordering on a desire to tear your hair and skin out a thing for any of y'all on the ?? mood time? like when i have upper energy but im not feeling confident and unstoppable and like i understand the meaning of the universe i have all the same jittery energy except in extreme easily triggered irritability, combined with a desire to crawl my way out of my body and claw at myself while screaming. im here and i hate it here. what do i do?",bipolar_disorder

"I have been on meds since I was 17 (23 now). Depakote, antipsychotics, you know the drill. Before taking meds, I had the typical healthy ""teenage"" sex drive.

I'm on Rexulti 3mg now, but they are switching me back to Abilify 20mg soon. 

I literally have no sex drive at 23. None. I am ""attracted"" to my husband, but the drive is just....gone. I feel 80 years old. I never think about sex.

"I am currently on 150mg and 1 week away from 200mg which is to my understanding the lowest typically therapeutic dosage. But I just had a hypomanic burst and now after that feel deeply depressed, enough to have just a hint of suicidal thoughts (theyâ€™ve passed and Iâ€™m very safe; and to be fair, this is definitely not even close to my worst depressive episodes that all happened pre-lamotrigine). 

Once Iâ€™ve reached a therapeutic dosage for me, how long until the swings go away, or at least become less frequent? I know sleep and lifestyle are important too, and Iâ€™m trying but these swings keep destroying my sleep schedule; I can make myself do some exercise and eat enough to be nutritionally well-rounded, but I canâ€™t get a grip on that sleep schedule dependably yet, despite efforts with bedtime rituals, special alarm clocks, etc (keep sleeping straight through normal ones, never used to do that). I have some medications to use PRN to help me sleep, but theyâ€™re often not enough.

Also, I just had what I think is my first â€œangryâ€ episode; I donâ€™t usually get very angry. What strategies help you prevent something that incites your anger from spiraling into hypomania? I tried using it â€œproductivelyâ€ (e.g. cleaning, meditation, etc) but it took all night to calm down and I finally slept at 7AM the next morning.

"See here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/t0gk4u/how_much_truth_is_there_that_you_cannot_lose_the/hy9tr06/?context=3

&gt;Adipogenesis is just the proliferation of adipose (fat storing) cells. Itâ€™s not unique to medication side-effects, you normally gain fat by both increasing the size and number of adipose cells in your body. What it means to a person is that theyâ€™re gaining weight by accumulating fat. Weight gain is a possible side effect of many drugs, including antipsychotics, due to both increased appetite and changes to your metabolism and hormonal regulations. It can be hard to lose weight after youâ€™ve gained it, but itâ€™s not some kind of insidious, malevolent process hell-bent on ruining your body image. Itâ€™s that your body now has a new balance point itâ€™s familiar with, and itâ€™s not easy to force it back to an old balance itâ€™s already forgotten.

&gt;Now, fat distribution is a weird process, and something we canâ€™t really control. Sometimes when you gain weight, a lot of fat accumulates in a certain place, and when you lose weight, the body decides to use fat from elsewhere first. You could gain 10 kg, and see a significant increase in your belly fat, then lose 10 kg, only to find out your belly didnâ€™t shrink all that much. Not being able to lose enough as much weight as you want (or get rid of a specific siteâ€™s fat) isnâ€™t a problem unique to people who takes certain medications, plenty of people are obese naturally and also face this problem. That doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s a totally irreversible process, or that someone with more adipose cells will always be fatter. Adipose cells swell up to several times its minimal size when accumulating fat.

&gt;For the ethical sideâ€¦ Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s only ethical to inform patients that the drug may have a side effect of weight gain, and they should be monitoring this, and talk to the doctor if they donâ€™t like what theyâ€™re seeing. I donâ€™t think a full lecture on the process of adipogenesis or the metabolism of fat is necessary or even beneficial.",bipolar_disorder

"For context she is ten. Her mom has been diagnosed with bipolar and BPD. Her biological father had severe depression, sadly leading to him taking his life. (Yes she did counseling after to work through that trauma). 

Ok, Iâ€™m just going to share one example but I could provide countless other examples of her behavior. 

My daughter and I have a routine. Iâ€™m a morning person so Iâ€™m always awake before she is. When her alarm goes off for school she will come downstairs and cuddle with me for 10 minutes before getting ready for the day. 

Yesterday she comes downstairs and I ask â€œwhat are you doing, arenâ€™t you up early?â€

And she starts to argue with me. And she gets angry at me for not remembering what time she wakes up. 

Later in the day we are talking and she says â€œdad Iâ€™m sorry. When I get angry like that all i see is red and my body feels like it is on fire. And I canâ€™t say Iâ€™m sorry in the moment because I wonâ€™t mean it when I feel like that.â€

"I talked last night with my partner about their fantasies - they said they wanted anal. I said no, I don't like that. Side note: We have tried it a couple of times in the past. A couple of times my partner pushed so hard into me that they hurt me. After the first time of that happening and telling them don't do that again it hurts, they did it again the next time we had sex. I'm not sure how easy it is to make this 'mistake'? I'm not a fan of anal, not after that. It was really one of those I love you, so I'll try it for you things. The convo continued, they then said you have liked it before actually...quite a lot...and there were many times like... That's when I stopped them. I felt sick. Those times were when I was manic.

The worst part of hearing this is that we'd already sat down with my psychiatrist last year who explained to my partner that my baseline self (when not manic) sex wise is no anal and to respect those boundaries. Because as we all know, the manic versions of ourselves don't tend to have that many limits. My partner agreed to respect what my psychiatrist said. Anal hasn't happened since then but it's like my partner had completely forgotten that anal is a hard no for me and even memories that came back of it make me feel repulsed. (No shade to people who do enjoy it, but it's not my thing.)

Also in the past when I asked my partner why they liked it, they said and I quote ""Because it hurts you."" Now if someone is a sadist, admit it. If that's your thing admit it. Maybe, just maybe we aren't sexually compatible. I have kinks too but I only like the good kind of pain during sex. When I called them out on it, they said what they meant is that it's a turn on to them whether I'm hurting from it or not but that when I moan sexually in relation to anal sex (from the discomfort/pain) it turns them on. Which personally makes me hate it even more.

If I am saying ok to anal, that's because I'm manic. I don't want to do anal. I feel so violated. I curled up and shivered in bed while trying not to cry last night. I don't feel very trusting of my partner today. I feel unsafe and scared. They knew at times I was not myself but just went ahead anyway.

For those wondering thinking mania is fun, this is fine and I'm in control. You're not. This is one of those times for me looking back with regret. I can't take back those times that I engaged in that, which I wouldn't have done if I wasn't manic.",bipolar_disorder

I'm not diagnosed, my psychiatrist is still evaluating my symptoms as we go along before she gives a clear cut label to whats going on, but she very recently put me on Lamotrigine and Sertraline and agrees that I'm somewhere on the bipolar spectrum.

It feels like every depressive episode hits harder than the last, and they just keep coming. The gap between my episodes has gone from 2-3 a year to every month. I dont want to harm myself or end it all or anything, but the intrusive thoughts of failure and hatred for life are starting to wear me down, it makes it so hard to do anything, I can barely even get out of bed, let alone work.

so friends, i wanted to ask what little things you do for yourself when youre down like that - ive got the brain fog bad and im having a hard time coming up with stuff on my own besides cigarettes and appreciating the twisted pleasure i get from my own misery. i dont mean the end all be all or the magic cure, just little things to try and keep yourself marching to the drum beat

"Hi everyone,

Several months ago I was diagnosed with ADHD. I actually reached out to my doctor to take the computer test. A lot of my behavior I thought was attributed to my bipolar was mostly due to my ADHD. Long story short - I got prescribed 20mg XR Adderal. Everything was great for a couple of months, but I started to notice I was seriously spiraling mentally. I've had a lot happen in the last few months to warrant depression and manic episodes. I'll spare everyone the details ... but my behavior to these situations was ridiculous. I felt like I did before I was medicated - if not, worse. 

I was in a manic state for about 2 months. Blew all my money, had crazy energy late at night. What really freaked me out is when I started hallucinating. I could not for the life of me understand why I felt so completely out of touch with myself mentally. I pushed away my two best friends bc I ""couldn't focus on anything, my ADD is terrible right now, and I don't have time to listen to your problems or welcome additional stress into my life"". My best friend finally called me and mentioned I began spiraling once I started the adderall.

I called my doctor and she prescribed me Intuniv. I have not started it yet. I just recently moved unexpectedly and am not sure when the right time to start a new medication is. I did some research on it ... Can anyone provide any insight? How did this work for you??",bipolar_disorder

There's just one problem: it requires 6 pictures or videos of you, and due to my mental issues, I haven't appeared in 6 non-family pictures in a long ass time. Also, my weight tends to fluctuate because of it so if you took two pictures, six months apart, I could be up or down 30 pounds so I can't even use old pictures as a crutch. Honestly, I'm just ranting and complaining, but I will take any advice you guys have on how not to nearly puke after taking a picture.

"My past 24 hours have been pretty crazy. I'm diagnosed with BPD and am on the bipolar spectrum. I just started taking Lamictal yesterday and it's been a ride. An hour after I took it yesterday, I began to feel incredibly exhausted and even started hearing noises, so I took a nap. I had the most intense, vivid nightmare I've ever had and it turned lucid (which I'd never experienced before.) Last night I had the kind of sleep where you wonder if you even slept at all. Took it a bit earlier this morning and I felt very confused and distant from everything for most of the morning -- almost like I was on the brink of an episode of derealization. I also felt very restless/anxious. That lasted a few hours, and now I feel high. I feel like I'm on the come up of MDMA. Warm, fuzzy, energetic, motivated, and a little sick from anxiety. I'm only on 25 mg. Is this normal? Am I imagining it? I can't believe all this is contained in a pill so tiny. This is the first time I've ever noticed the effects of any medication.

"Last summer I hit rock bottom and decided I needed serious help. I arranged to see a psychiatrist and seek a diagnosis for what was wrong with me/ medication management. She diagnosed with bipolar in 3 minutes. I informed my therapist about my diagnosis, she said that it didnâ€™t sound right and was pretty headstrong in her belief that I had adhd. I told my psychiatrist about my weariness in thinking I mightâ€™ve been misdiagnosed and she was very receptive and ended up doing an assessment. I was then medicated for adhd and depression.

Now the problem comes in where
I think the bipolar diagnosis mightâ€™ve been correct as well, I might have both but Iâ€™m not sure. Today it dawned on me that Iâ€™ve been stuck in a loop of having really negative emotions over the dumbest thing for about 2-3 days and then suddenly Iâ€™ll feel amazing like Iâ€™m on top of the world and nothing matters and life is great, I wonâ€™t even remember feeling depressed. I never do anything too risky or outlandish so I actually really enjoy when I feel like this. I realized I usually get this feeling when I donâ€™t get enough sleep.

Idk exactly what information Iâ€™m seeking to get from this post, just wondering if anyone else is in a similar predicament",bipolar_disorder
Yeah. I kinda pretended I didnâ€™t have an eating disorder for the last 10 years because I never purged or obsessively exercised.

Understanding that Iâ€™m not as successful as I could have been or as my peers are, regretting life changing decisions Iâ€™ve made, hating everything about everything, etc. This has put me into a pretty deep depression.

So Iâ€™ve been on lamictal for a while now and have had no problems. Iâ€™m on 200m. This morning I had a small area of red on my collar bone and it itched so I did scratch at it. I stopped scratching around four hours ago and thereâ€™s still a slight amount of red. Not a lot, but a little. So honestly, at what point do you guys think I should be concerned?

My health

Give me back control

Make me whole

You don't exist anywhere

It's just me

My mouth to my ear

A circle of fear

Chaos orbiting

Stagnant morbidity

Open wounds in zero g

Creating a mosaic of crimson vitality

Until time pulls the life flow

Back into my veins, my troughs

The containers where my demons suckle

Under their weight I buckle

As I did before

I was outside for maybe 10 minutes and I started overheating and sweating profusely and shaking, to the point where I almost passed out.

Hey guys I just recently got diagnosed with bipolar and been prescribed this medicine lamotrigine. My psychiatrist said that it is safe to smoke while on it but never mentioned anything about drinking. I plan to continue drinking a couple times a week and wanted to know if this interferes with the meds or had any side effects. Is anyone else on lamotrigine that could maybe share some of their knowledge with me?,bipolar_disorder
"I have a relatively new psychiatrist, currently on 200mg Lamictal. I used to be on 2mg Abilify for psychosis THEN as a mood stabilizer (I dropped that psychiatrist) and it was torture. 40 lbs gained, completely zombified and my job requires me to be creative so that was out the window.

Things were going well, I have high praise for Lamictal because it was the first drug to actually make a difference. Iâ€™ve been very anxious and kinda paranoid recently, I told my psych this and it feels like they passively prescribed this and didnâ€™t listen to my concerns regarding the weight gain and sedation, because I MAINLY suffer from depression that led to hospitalization. I am concerned the weight gain and sedation will actually cause me to become depressed, as Iâ€™ve worked soooo hard to lose weight and feel happy with myself, only to have it all taken away by a drug like this again.

Itâ€™s ironic - Iâ€™m paranoid about a drug that might prevent my paranoia. Instead, it feels like Iâ€™m sacrificing a lot for a cost thatâ€™s not worth it, and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m allowed to turn this down without looking/sounding crazy. Iâ€™m just genuinely concerned and kind of scared. How will it look if I just said I wasnâ€™t comfortable and wished to maybe postpone this medication? Or does that just make my paranoia look worse? Ugh, what a damn mess.

Wondering if anyone has experience with this medication OR has been in a similar situation with feeling uncomfortable with meds but not wanting to deny their own success. My gut feeling is very intense right now.

"Trigger warning maybe? 

Hi everyone (15f) 

I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 in March and have been trying new meds since. I had been prescribed dopaquel/seroquel back in April and we have been increasing it slightly to get to my goal dose 500mg( I am 141 pounds).

The problem is that I am currently on 400mg and every time I take it, the next morning it feels like I've overdosed. I can't walk, talk or do anything properly besides sleep and I need at least 20 hours of sleep to function efficiently again, which just isn't doable. I have school, homework and exams to study for I can't spend my days and weekends sleeping. So I haven't been taking them for atleast 2+ weeks.

I know consistency is key but I really see no point in taking them if they make me feel really bad

Its just really hard to get my day going, and I'm not sure if I'm in a slump or if it's the new med change. For anyone on this, how long did it take you to get adjusted to it?

"I (31m) don't believe I'm bipolar and have never been diagnosed as such. 14 months ago I suddenly had some horribly distressing mental health symptoms overnight. None prior.

For those entire 14 months I had terrible intrusive harm like OCD thoughts (still do just less), depression, anxiety, dpdr, and PTSD. I felt like a 1-3 / 10 low every single day.

I basically played video games all day everyday just to get me through the day.

I've been on Nardil for about 1.5 months, but I went from 60mg to 75mg a week ago. I also started 2.5mg of Abilify a week ago. 

Since then my productivity levels have went much higher. I'm less irritable. My mind has quieted down. I'm able to fall asleep around the same time as I have been going to sleep for a long time now (11:30ish pm), but I'm finding that I'm waking up between 4-7am and not being able to fall asleep.

I was inpatient for 2 weeks before discharging myself because the PDOC was an idiot. I'm home now, mood is great but barely sleeping.

My friend has recommended I call my old PDOC tomorrow for a med review because she thinks I need to slow down, and sleep and eat more. 

She made me promise to eat at least once a day as I've lost 9kg in less than a month as some food is just not safe for me right now.

She also made me give my partner my bank card and he will give me cash. I've managed to spend a few thousand in a week since leaving hospital.  

She also told me not to go to a client meeting this afternoon but I went anyway - it's a blur but the client scaled their budget after I spoke for almost 2 hours so guessing it went well, I hope.

What else can I do to keep my life safe right now and start to come down?

I start a new job in 10 days, because I decided to resign from my old one around the time the mania hit. Kind of good timing because I don't have to work full time again until then, except for a little freelance work.

"
I had a very severe manic episode about a year ago that was filled with hallucinations, delusions, and severed ties that have been restored. Due to the help and hard work of my family and medical team I was able to grasp back to reality. My friends that I thought I have pushed away came back. I went to therapy on a bi weekly basis. I started to look for employment and found a job.
I tried to keep the manic energy side of me and went back to the gym with a personal trainer. Then the momentum stopped.

I ghosted multiple people who helped me. From my medical team to my employment. I just found it to be more comfortable to be indoors. I shut myself away, playing games with my friends who kept their lives going while I was in a quagmire of comfort and creature comforts. I took up smoking again, a habit I gained while manic. Along with an occasional drink and edible. 

 I have had roughly 8 weeks of employment and am currently not in any other form of advancement to a â€œcareerâ€.  I am the biggest that I have ever been and my self respect is at an all time low. Even lower than post manic me reflected on all that I have done.

"Hi everyone, I'm 28F and my diagnosis is Bipolar II, OCD and BPD. Yeah I'm kind of the whole package ðŸ˜‚.

So for the last 8 months I was taking 10mg Lexapro, 4 of which with 25mg Xanax and the last 4 with 10mg Abilify. I gained 12 kilos and my mood plummeted. I was constantly like a zombie and unreasonably tired. Kind of like in a state of lethargic and calm semi depression. My daily life consisted of three coffees and 2 monsters and I was still heavily sleepy. As for my sex drive, well, it had seen better days...

So three days ago, I started Wellbutrin and my clothes immediately the next day were fiting nicer. My belly seems flatter, my binge eating subsided and I have a lot more energy. It could be a placebo effect but I measured myself and I've lost 2 inches in three days!

I did a lot of reckless things: went on holidays all by myself, spent most of my savings on Iâ€™m not even sure what, had unprotected sex with a bunch of strangers and ended up getting an std (treatable at the very least), tried drugs and it all ended up with me trying to kill myself.

"TLDR; I have a delusion that prevents me from being alone at all in any capacity at night, ESPECIALLY outside of my apartment. I have no idea how to word it in a way people will understand how severe the fear is for me. Analogies would be great.


I'll break it down


Trigger: Being alone outside at night, being alone at home at night, being on back roads at night -  to a lesser extent being outside at night,  and night in general. 


Belief/delusion: A non-human entity will somehow take me, no one will hear me scream or ever find me. I won't be on this plane of existence. It will be unspeakable horrors for, presumably, eternity. 


How I manage this: don't be alone at night and don't go outside at night, which obviously puts a huge hindrance on my support. If I have to leave my house it has to be with someone else, and very rarely I can manage someone being on the phone but I still feel incredibly unsafe. I cope with showers by listening to a video or music while I shower. I still have to have a clear shower curtain.

It's gotten significantly better since I started Latuda at 19. I used to have panic attacks in the shower, take Ambien to get fucked up enough I could sleep (before that, genuinely my entire life, I would sit in the corner of my bed in the corner of my room rocking and crying sometimes until dawn. Once dawn hit I felt safe. I couldn't be home alone at all, even during the day. I struggled leaving at night even in groups. It got to the extent that I couldn't even leave my apartment. Now, I can go to sleep at night with my SO in the next room and I feel safe, more or less. That's more than I ever possibly imagined I could have. While I would love to be, for lack of a better term, normal, I don't see that happening.

Nothing has helped that wasn't the Latuda. No therapy, no coping skills, and I never grew out of it- the belief solidified and worsened the older I got. All I ever told people was that I was terrified of the dark and night in general. I finally talked to my roommate today, who said I needed to learn to deal with it (going outside alone) at some point and just force myself to do it. How can I even attempt to do that in a way that isn't traumatizing (I genuinely believe the 19 years I spent night after night with these beliefs traumatized me) and in a way where I don't feel like more than just my life is at stake?",bipolar_disorder

And we all know that pay isn't great for hardly anyone right now to begin with. So my already tight budget gets stretched to the breaking point, and I have to ration meds to the point that I put myself into episodes which causes lasting damage.

"hello! iâ€™m a 27y f, diagnosed Bipolar Type 1 a few months ago. I experienced what I now know was mania, and that led to psychosis which is what landed me in the hospital. This happened shortly after my dad passed away from Stage 4 lung cancer, 8 months after his diagnosis. 
Now Iâ€™m on lithium, which hasnâ€™t given me many side effects aside from thirst, and I canâ€™t sleep in like I used to. (I work evening shift.)
But this was my first time experiencing mania, and Iâ€™ve had depression in the past but it was situational. 
I guess I just canâ€™t believe because of this one episode, now I have to be on medication for the rest of my life. My therapist agrees that it could have been a response to losing my dad, but Iâ€™m also nervous to go off the lithium because iâ€™ve heard it loses its effectiveness when you go off and on, and also I am finally starting to feel less depressed after my doctor upped my dosage.

I adopt the belief that everyone hates me and that they interact with me because they are forced to. I cut ties with everyone. I genuinely believe everyone hates me. 

I wouldnâ€™t consider myself a religious person, but I have my beliefs and somewhat practice my religion. When Iâ€™m in a depressive episode, this all changes, my thoughts become nihilistic in nature, I turn away from God, I turn away from my religion, at times I even get angry at him and start to believe heâ€™s put this disease in me because he hates me (I know mental illness is caused by a chemical imbalance, these thoughts just arise during my depressive episodes)

"TLDR: What has helped you come to acceptance of your diagnosis and not feeling completely overwhelmed when it started to show?

Hello all, new to this subreddit. I've dealt with severe depression and suicidally since I was 13 (I'm 24 now). Over the past year and half, my counselor and I have been putting together patterns in behavior. For awhile it was a, maybe bipolar? In my head, it was just ""red"" depression and ""blue"" depression. The red was where all my anger, tension, violent thoughts (and what I call ""feeling insane""). The blue was this dark, calmer, hellish blackhole. 

When I started getting medicated with mood stabilizers instead of antidepressants, that did seen to help some. Well, I got out of the psych ward two weeks ago for what probably was a hypomanic episode. Most of it was the anger, extreme suicidality and homicidality, intrusive bad thoughts /memories, and a general on edge feeling. I'd tried to punch a friend (I've never done that before), ended up driving for hours in the middle of the night and slept in a parking lot. Then checked into the hospital lol. 

It seems a lot clearer now the likelihood, and it terrifies me. It's not going to get easier. I want to be above stigma but even the label itself is overwhelming. I have a psych degree, I've been in counseling for years now, I'm informed to the best of my ability and know better. But, it's like I want to go to the store, ""hi, I'd like to return this please. Just the crippling depression please, if I have to choose."" I'm used to surviving the depression. In my head at least, (and I certainly don't mean to be dismissive in any way!), the depression stigma is less. But the mania is fucking awful. For like, a day, I had some not all negative energy. But everything else. I honestly don't know how to accept this.",bipolar_disorder

"Howdy folks

Senior in college here reaching the limits of my motivation. I have developed a nasty habit of living in a cycle of productivity/procrastination. I'll be productive for a few weeks to a month and then end up losing all motivation then sequentially giving up after a particularly bad day. Usually this bad day ends up lasting somewhere between a couple weeks to months. Because of their timing, I am starting to believe these productivity cycles coincide with my ability to stay resilient with self-monitoring during depressive episodes. Compounded by ADHD, the depressive episodes hit me really hard and I struggle either because I don't have the motivation to execute or because I completely forget/over-procrastinate on tasks.

then i joined an intensive outpatient therapy program and everything changed. if you have insurance, find one. itâ€™s therapy every weekday for three hours a day. you are held accountable by a group for growth and change 5 days a week for 8 weeks. i have pretty bad insurance and the whole eight weeks was $400. they make it affordable because they WANT you to do it. and personally every single one of us needs way more therapy than once a week. and we need peers to do it with.

now i work at a cat cafe, a job i love to do every day and have maintained this position for 6 months which is huge for me. instead of being depressed for two years straight, i have about 5 bad but manageable days a month right now. i lead through the world with my heart and i am stable enough to love others openly.

I been in treatment and medication for 6+ years since my last episode. I work as a MH advocate for reduced barriers and better continuum of care for people with MH disorders.

Today I had this really weird experience where the concerned family members were the ones I was worried about having a mental illness. And Iâ€™d be damn scared if *any* of them were able to make decisions on my behalf. 

I work in behavioral health and it reminded me of caregivers getting power/attention by being hyper vigilant and hyper involved in controlling care for their loved one.

I understand that SMI with psychotic features can affect our loved ones and make them scared for us. But this was on a different level and had a vibe of â€œteach me what to say to get my loved one to do what I want to control their symptoms.â€

Iâ€™m all for helping people understanding any chronic health condition they are dealing with. Getting good insight about how it affects them and how to reduce unwanted complications and move them toward self-directed goals.

In addition sometimes I feel like my mind is out of my body, and that caught my therapists attention. It feels like I am in a some kind of 3rd person perspective. She said that I should read about how people with bipolar disorder feel, so that's why I am here, because info around the internet is very general and can be applied to a lot of people. I'd be grateful if you could describe your experience",bipolar_disorder

"So Iâ€™ve always struggled with attachment and it usually manifests in authoritative figures in my life.
But something Iâ€™ve noticed a pattern in and being something more(?) common is I get completely consumed by the world and people in a series I may be watching and attached to the idea of those people and then becoming more depressed because I know that these people are not real and that I canâ€™t have this lifestyle or figures in my life. It then leaves me feeling even more dissatisfied with my reality and thinking â€˜whatâ€™s the point?â€™. I think I know this is because Iâ€™m not happy with my current life and want something different but Iâ€™m tired of this feeling and want to enjoy something without feeling like this. Itâ€™s like no career will be enough or relationship which saddens me as Iâ€™m in a loving long term relationship. Does anyone else feel like this? Am I making sense?",bipolar_disorder
"I went off my medication because I was feeling really sick on it and my doctor wasnâ€™t giving me regular blood tests like I was told it requires. I even asked for it and they kept saying next time. Well, a year later and I still havenâ€™t had the blood test. I lost 20lbs and was super tired and weak. Iâ€™m not trying to excuse my behavior by any means just provide an explanation for why I stopped. However, I felt so much better physically a week after. My bruises went away and my face looked so much better. No more sunken eyes. 
Anyway, I had an episode.. big surprise right? Lol Well, instead of anyone in my family coming to me and talking to me about what I did during it.. they instead all called each other and talked about it. Itâ€™s been a week and I am now just hearing about it. Now I am feeling so depressed and embarrassed. It led me to wonder what others experiences are.

"Hey all

I just wanted to check what your experiences have been. I have diagnosed anxiety and bipolar disorder plus sleep issues. So I've been lexamil 20mg and epitec 200g with dopaquel 50g for a year now. My experience has been 18kgs of weight gain although my eating habits are the same plus I have become VERY robotic, I have not a care in the world to the point where if someone close to me died I would have minimal reaction. 

My doctor also prescribed Xanax but I dont take it because if I took it how he prescribed it I'd be taking Xanax everyday which to me seems dangerous.

It bugs me a bit because I saw this doctor one time and 3 times in the course of the year and from the 1st visit he prescribed me all of this.

"Hello all. I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 formally for about 2 years now. Bounced between Effexor (didn't help), Klonopin (REALLY didn't help), Depakote, Abilify, Olanzapine, Gabapentin, and am now on 100mg of Lamictal daily, nothing else. It's hard to wake up in the morning, fight off intrusive thoughts and in general enjoy life. I haven't had a manic episode in over a year, but that's been exchanged for a non-suicidal depression that's getting harder and harder to manage. 

I've been looking into Caplyta and Latuda to supplement the Lamictal. Of course, I'll be consulting my psych about it when I see her next week, but I just wanted to see if anyone here had tried that cocktail, and if the benefits outweighed the side effects.",bipolar_disorder

"Hi, sorry if this is a stupid/annoying question or anything. Sorry in advance for being kind of rambly and all over the place.

Anyways, so I recently got diagnosed as BD1 after 2 years with a BD2 diagnosis. It honestly made more sense than I would have liked to admit, but thatâ€™s a whole other conversation.

Iâ€™ve had some manic episodes in the past but far more hypomanic episodes (and mainly depression most of the time). I havenâ€™t made any rash decisions or anything, but this feels worse than usual, I guess. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s been going on over the past four days or so:

- Canâ€™t fall asleep unless I take a few Benadryl, and even then it takes a while and I get up in the middle of the night only to not fall back asleep
- Racing thoughts
- Increased heart rate
- Irritability
- Amplified anxiety in general
- Canâ€™t sit still even more than usual (I have ADHD)
- Talking constantly and quickly when Iâ€™m with other people
- OCD symptoms are amplified
- Overwhelming motivation to do many things at once
- Canâ€™t relax at all, even with sustained effort
- Way more on-edge than usual
- Spending more money than I usually do despite the fact that Iâ€™m saving for a MacBook for college right now
- Canâ€™t â€œturn my brain offâ€ for even a second

Iâ€™m very stressed out over this right now, and I have friends coming over later. Is there any way I can relax a bit so itâ€™s not so obvious when theyâ€™re here?",bipolar_disorder

I always have auditory hallucinations but they are usually just noises like rustling in the yard, knocks, bangs, etc. Iâ€™ve never had â€œvoicesâ€ per se.

It was scary and I couldnâ€™t make them stop, I could only drown them out by putting tv on and putting earbuds in. Or if I tightly pushed my head against the pillow.

"I got really anxious and tried to cut off a growing friendship based on delusional fears and insecurities. I felt like I was going to relive a bad situation that emotionally traumatized me so I overanalyzed, said a bunch of nonsense, and attempted to flee. I was very wrong and when I've done things like this it almost feels unconsious, and I don't realize what I've done until after the fact. I assume the worst and react to that assumption accordingly. It's do dangerous and I don't wanna do this ever again. I'm deeply depressed now. The friendship is irrepairable and she has bipolar disorder too.

"Ive been diagnosed Bipolar 1 but also supposedly ""misdiagnosed"" multiple times with depression, anxiety, adhd, and BPD. So I'm pretty sure I have bipolar though I sometimes question it, although I've been consistently on medication for 2 years. I am on Lithium 1200 mg and Latuda 40 mg per day, and it is a night-and-day  improvement from when I wasn't on meds.  


Anyways, I normally sleep 12AM to 8AM every day, even on weekends. Last night I slept at 2AM because I was on a long phone call, then I couldn't sleep in past 9AM. This isn't an outrageous amount of sleep deprivation, and I felt good in the morning. It's about noon and suddenly I'm feeling really foggy, extremely irritable, overthinking and anxious, and struggle to be physically active.  


I don't think this is mania because i'm not productive, energetic, or euphoric. I don't know if this is depression, because my mind is very active (albeit in a miserable way) and I can't go back to sleep.  


I am just stuck in this weird limbo where I'm miserable and slightly dissociated but not in enough danger to warrant asking for immediate help. This happens every single time I shift my sleep schedule. Even though I'm fully medicated, am I doomed to a life where I can't go out at night?

"25 year old female. I have been on lithium 300mg as well as trileptal 300mg, hydroxyzine 10mg for anxiety as needed. That is the same medications I have been on since about 20 years old, of course with some dosage changes here. So to say the least, I am pretty anxious about going through the psychiatrist treatment again. 

I am wondering, has anyone had any experience with buspirone? I am very very nervous to take it because I want to still feel like me, and I really don't want any side effects. Also, my anxiety has just been so bad that I feel that is why my medications are not working. My anxiety has been taking over my life more so lately than bipolar has. I feel I have the bipolar under control more than anything. 

I am one of those people that hates to have to take a medication for anxiety everyday, because I always felt it was something that can be controlled more so with lifestyle changes, but I am at the point now that I can't even function so I have to do this. 

I am also changing my lithium from immediate release to extended release. The reason for that is because on regular lithium, at least as of lately after a few years of taking, I just feel so unmotivated, faded, tired, etc. so the doc. suggested I do the extended release. Anyone have experience with Lithium ER? 

I would love to hear any and all experiences with these medications or even if its something similar that may help. I know each and every one of us is different when it comes to how our symptoms of bipolar are and how we react to medications but still would love to know your experiences. 

Thank you so much everyone!",bipolar_disorder
"I had a horrible psychotic mixed episode in July/August which I finally reigned in with a lot of Risperdal and Seroquel. I had so many creepy/terrifying visual hallucinations, racing psychotic thoughts, sexual assault flashbacks, blacking out/severe dissociation, paranoia, 2-3 hrs of sleep per night, etc. 

I've been low key depressed since then but surprisingly functional enough to go back to my part time remote job. I started tapering down on my anytipsychotics over the last few weeks with my pdoc's OK because I was having severe akathisia from the Risperdal and hungover effects from Seroquel. But last week was a mess. Depression got worse to the point of having some SI, not keeping up with work responsibilities, spending 20 hours a day isolating in my room, barely moving/talking, flipping back and forth between feeling superior to other human beings (like being a more conscious being) and feeling terribly guilty for even thinking that. And starting to have worse sleeping problems again...slept &lt; 3hrs last night. I'm terrified of going back to the place I was in July/August because it was honestly horrifying and scary. 

However, I get terrible akathisia from Risperdal and the ""hangover"" from Seroquel is no fun either. I'm so frustrated with medication. I have to take antipsychotics, but my body hates them. Any sort of ""activating"" AP like Vraylar, latuda, rexulti, abilify gives me unbearable akathisia. Anybody have any luck with Caplyta for managing psychosis? I'm looking for meds that can help with mania/psychosis/sleep that don't cause Akathisia or a lot of weight gain. I currently take 15mg artane (for akathisia), 1mg Risperdal, 900mg lithium and 50 mg lamictal (higher dose of Lamictal gives me orthostatic tachycardia, so can't increase that).

Part of this post is looking for med ideas that I can bring up with my doctor since she's tried almost everything with me, and another part is just wanting some camaraderie around feeling terrified of your own brain and struggling with scary symptoms that just don't want to leave.",bipolar_disorder

The ruminations and anxieties are gone and replace with euphoria. I gain a constant, deep appreciation of nature and it's colors are more vibrant than ever.

"I've been stressing over my job for the past few days, resulting in two sleepless nights.

I graduated uni at the end of last year and got a job as a new graduate clinician in January. Then in early June I had my first manic episode where I went into psychosis, and led to 5 weeks in the psych ward and a diagnosis of Bipolar type 1. I've been back at work part time for 3 weeks now and while my coworkers and manager have all been really lovely and accommodating, I saw clients again for the first time on Wednesday and it really shocked me how much I struggled because of my reduced cognition.

I feel like being a new graduate clinician is difficult enough, but adding cognitive deficits to a profession that requires a high level of organising, rationalising, planning and thinking on your feet is just unachievable for me at the moment. I could try and stick it out a few more weeks and see if I improve but I can see myself really struggling and not performing at an acceptable standard in sessions and I don't think that's fair on myself or for my clients. 

I don't want to quit because it's a really good job with amazing coworkers, and an amazing foot in the door for my profession, but I think at the moment I need to find a job that involves a lot less mental resources.

Has anyone got any advice or been through anything similar? How long does it take for your cognition to come back after psychosis? I had no idea I was bipolar prior to this manic episode (no family history), so this is all still fairly new to me.",bipolar_disorder

"Quick question i thought that psychosis was supposed to be a fixed belief that cannot be changed in the face of concrete evidence that suggests otherwise (and usually needs meds to resolve quickly)

So my Dr and I have a disagreement about whether an incident was psychosis or anxiety. 

2 weeks i believed that people were out to harm me from my past experiences with SA (they were going to see me on train and shoot me) and that that one specific (cashier) had memorized my cc info and DL number (froming being carded at grocery store) and was plotting to withdrawl as much money as they could from my checking account using the info from both cards. 

I asked my Dr for klonopin to pass the time until these thoughts dissipated.She is very kind and gave me a script for klonopin but disagreed with me on one ground. 

She opines that those were delusions and suggested to start an antipsychotic. I agreed to trial an antipsychotic in two weeks. I told her I didn't think these were delusions as they were rooted in past bad experiences and bank fraud is a very real and serious issue. I told her most likely in two weeks if nothing happened to me my anxiety over these fears would decrease to almost nothing (the wait being my firm of reality testing). Well 2 weeks passed and nothing happened so far i feel a lot better with no meds; so I'm now stuck with a script for abilify 5 mg. 

My question is don't real delusions stick around and are less based in reality and don't resolve in that short of a time period unmedicated. Only took 4 clonazapin during those 2 weeks. 

Also I know hypomania with ""psychotic features"" is not permissible within the DSM V framework so if this were classified as something would it be like standalone psychosis? Sleep was not impacted just very anxious and distracted during those two weeks.",bipolar_disorder

I think today is the perfect example and I just had to tell people that might understand. 

First, I don't know if I'm alone in this, but it doesn't take an episode for me to do weird things. Sometimes these weird things happen because it's how I let off the stress that's building up that might cause an episode. Feeling edgy and awful? Oh look a new tattoo. Feeling like I'm going to explode? Alright, let's do something explosively creative and let it out. Sometimes it works sometimes not. One of the things that I have used as a tool is paint. Like paint on my walls. Complete paint changes, whole walls, just designs, whatever. That almost always helps me chill.

We're painting the fucking wall!

I need help. Iâ€™m manic right now and I havenâ€™t been for a very long time. I just moved up on my meds a few days ago but itâ€™s going to take some time for them to work.

Iâ€™m constantly on my phone and I canâ€™t stop myself from being on social media. Thereâ€™s a lot to argue about right now and Iâ€™m getting drawn into arguments. Iâ€™m checking my phone like 30 times an hour. I checked my screen time tracker and I spent 16 hours on my phone yesterday, all on social media, just checking notifications and doom scrolling. I need to stop. 

Iâ€™m trying to at least shift my focus to online games but I think Iâ€™m obsessed at the moment.

"Before therapy, I was a wreck. Screaming, arguing, and threatening to harm myself/ loved ones/ animals (never did and never allowed it) multiple times a week and hell, multiple times a day. 

Iâ€™m not gonna lie, I was a completely different person. I didnâ€™t care who I hurt and I got to the point my dad did where I was willing to hurt anything physically now to deal with my problems. 

Thankfully I threw myself into therapy and met my therapist 2-3 months ago and sheâ€™s great! Iâ€™ve been working with her almost weekly and havenâ€™t missed a single session, sheâ€™s amazing! 

And my boyfriend really likes the progress. What used to be outbursts 2-5x a day over the smallest stuff is now 1-2x every week or every other week. I did stop taking medications but I am going to go back on it (Iâ€™m honestly just terrified of my psychiatrist judging me for going on and off on my meds). But without it, my anger and anxiety have both gone down significantly and Iâ€™m a lot more calm/ collected. 


But thereâ€™s one thing I noticed and Iâ€™m not sure how to deal with it, my therapist noticed it too and weâ€™re talking about it but Iâ€™m honestly terrified of it when it happens? Whenever I get angry still, itâ€™s no longer wanting to hurt anyone but myself. All I do now is try to break my bones or punch walls and Iâ€™m not too sure how to stop it. 

There was a good 3 weeks too where I had severe black outs and couldnâ€™t remember if they were out of anger or stress. And they just normally come out of nowhere now when Iâ€™m upset/ stressed/ or angry. Ontop of that just the trauma Iâ€™ve been keep buried 6ft under in my mind isnâ€™t making it any better.",bipolar_disorder
"due to my bipolar iâ€™m very sensitive and break down easily. i was slowly learning to be stronger but today broke me, not only were my family screaming at each other i had earlier by like minutes talked to my psych to discuss how my meds arenâ€™t working. 

my dad was yelling at my mom, my brother was yelling at my dad and i was just in the middle asking everyone to stop. 

in the end they stopped because i had a really bad panic attack i was screaming and crying i also canâ€™t control my limbs when iâ€™m in a breakdown so my entire body was shaking like a seizure. 

luckily (not really lucky) it made the fighting stop. everyoneâ€™s attention was on me and calming me down because i get really bad when iâ€™m having a panic attack. my dad held me and my brother calmed me down with breathing exercises and my mom got me water. it took a good 10 minutes till i was calm but the hurt was still there. 

we all just sat there in silence for a while till my dad got up and left. my brother kept calming me down and held me for a while. iâ€™m still kinda shaking but this was 4/3 hours ago. i prayed for everyone to sleep in peace. hopefully tomorrow will be better.",bipolar_disorder

Can u act normal? Why are u so unstable?"" Everytime I'm unhappy with something shitty he did. And it goes on. It's really painful and honestly not even in my worst relationships this happened.

"I was a flight attendant with a brand new airline (apart of itâ€™s launch) and I got fired after nine months over a phone call. After showing up on time and working long days, miserable with my schedule and not even minimum wage pay. No health benefits or flight benefits.
My crew was left stranded in a city after they moved our accommodation to the cheapest place they could find next to the airport and crew refused to work the incoming flight i was supposed to operate home because of anger at our updated accommodation. They didnâ€™t ask, but TOLD my entire crew we would be forced to stay there on a day off without overtime and they lied saying it was literally the only option to get us home. 
After nine months of absolute bullshit like this, i called someone who manages scheduling and told them basically to go fuck themselves. 
Today they fired me for this language, without notice or warning. This is my first incident. They are also taking away my $1500 bonus i worked tirelessly for.
However a few months ago a pilot did far worse to me, swore and yelled at me and rejected safety procedure to go home in front of the other flight attendants AND passengers. When i reported this he suffered no consequences, we had a sit down meeting with HR where i was basically teamed up on and insulted to my face. I managed to keep my anger down and move forward but now i literally feel so exploited, i feel like i was just shit on after all of my hard work.

"Hi! I was put on Welbutrin about 2 months ago. The first week ish seemed okay, didnâ€™t notice much of a difference but then the rest of the 1.5 months got progressively horrible. It gave me the absolute WORST extremes of anxiety, paranoia, depression, mania, and OCD characteristics that Iâ€™ve ever experienced in my lifeâ€” basically all at once. It got to the point where I was having active suicidal ideation almost every day and anxiety attacks almost every night, rolling around on the floor crying and hyperventilating and almost frozen. I had to call and text crisis lines frequently with little to no help. Iâ€™m a mental health counselor myself so I was able to help myself some by talking myself down, but it was honestly horrifying for me. My best friend and husband were planning to convince me to admit myself to a hold. 

My psychiatristâ€™s office and I kept playing phone tag so I eventually gave up and stopped the Welbutrin. Iâ€™ve been off it about 2 weeks now and I feel like a completely different person. Has anyone else had such a strong reaction to this? This is the first time a medication Iâ€™ve tried has completely fucked me up.",bipolar_disorder

Itâ€™s all I can think about. I â€œseeâ€ flashes or how I would do it. I know exactly how and why here I would go, I would never want family or friends finding me. 2 weeks ago I had a date picked, but I didnâ€™t go through with it.

My therapist and psych are aware but not much has come out of it other than check ins now and then. The hospital question was raised but nothing ever suggested or forced.

Today my thoughts have been so bad I just want it to end. Iâ€™ve always had suicidal thoughts, but never daily and as intense and intrusive as this. Iâ€™m at a loss and cannot keep going day after day with these thoughts.

"I've been struggling with a depressive episode since the beginning of the year. On Saturday, I had so much SI and I came VERY close to acting on it. I literally would have had my husband hadn't happen to call at that very moment. I am starting to feel very unsafe, and I have acted on SI in the past. 

I've been working closely with my psychiatrist and we've tried so much when it's some to meds, and nothing seems to be stabilizing me. In fact, I've been going even more downhill recently according to my mood tracking. I also see a therapist weekly. 

I know that there is more I can do for my mental health that is non-med related, like eat healthier, go to therapy groups, and get more movement in, but I feel like I use all my energy everyday just getting myself to put in the bare minimum at work. And putting in the bare minimum makes me feel awful about myself and guilty. 

I have a marketing 9-5 job that is mostly remote. It's probably the best/most low key gig I've had but it still makes me miserable. I've worked in marketing my whole career so far and I think I am decent at it, but I hate it. After I tried to OD in December of 2020, I was fired from one job and then I spent some time unemployed. While it was financially rough, when I was unemployed I was the happiest/most stable I've felt in my adult life (after a few months of adjustment). Ever since I started working again my mood has just gotten lower and lower and the SI louder and louder. I don't think it's a coincidence. 

How do you decide to quit your job for the sake of your mental health? I am afraid if I do I will never have a career again. And what if leaving the job doesn't help my mental health? What if I only hate my job because of the depression and I will regret leaving it when it lifts? I plan on driving for DoorDash if I quit, but I am definitely afraid how this will effect my husband and I's finances. Is it worth it anyway?",bipolar_disorder

"I know yâ€™all will understand when I say Iâ€™m so freakin tired of dealing with this and living this way. I was diagnosed years ago and had been off meds for a little over 3 years and had been managing rather well. During that time I applied and got into grad school, got a full time job and created some great friendships. Then it all came crashing down. I started noticing signs a few months ago but put them off because I had started a new asthma medication thatâ€™s known for causing mental health side effects so I just stopped taking it and tried gaining control back in other ways. I started going to the gym regularly thinking itâ€™s great for your mental health and they always recommend exercise so why not? It should help, right? Wrong. It helped, but it wasnâ€™t enough and about a month ago I crashed hard and couldnâ€™t get rid of spiraling thoughts. I started having suicidal thoughts regularly and ended up reaching out and letting my long time best friend know as well as a new best friend I made 2 years ago and my boss who I consider to be a close friend what was going on. While theyâ€™ve been supportive, I know itâ€™s too much for the new best friend and after Iâ€™ve overshared a few times I feel like Iâ€™m going to lose our friendship because I keep screwing up and treating her like crap or it seems like Iâ€™m making her feel guilty. And I canâ€™t blame her for any of it because I worry that iâ€™m guilting her at times too and apparently I still donâ€™t learn. Sheâ€™s said she thinks we need to take a step back from our friendship/hanging out and while it hurts I 100% understand where sheâ€™s coming from and honestly Iâ€™m proud of her for setting boundaries. Iâ€™m so tired of over analyzing everything and creating problems that arenâ€™t there. Iâ€™m so tired of hating on myself for the way that I think. Iâ€™m so tired of all of it and even though I started back on meds a little over a week ago and am working on getting into therapy iâ€™m just feeling defeated and hate living like this.",bipolar_disorder
"Just yesterday I made a post saying that I was finally opening up to my therapist and that she is putting a referral for a full psych screen and ever since I can't stop thinking about how I don't want this.

How am I supposed to admit to hurting myself and reckless driving and all of the impulsive decisions I made and make without a second thought? I just want to block the numbers and emails to the therapy company and fall off the face of the earth. I have made it this long without help why can't I just make it through life without it? 

I am going to continue the treatment. I am just extremely paranoid. I have to do it. I know that I do. But I have a feeling this isn't going to end well. I need to get my shit together though. It's my first semester in college and I already had to withdraw from calculus and am failing others because of the intense depression I am either sleeping all day or not at all.

My psychiatrist said it might be time to consider ECT, but, after more careful consideration, I don't think that's for me either. I'm afraid ECT would make me stupid, and when I'm stable, I'm actually a very smart lady. I'm not willing to sacrifice my intelligence for anything. 

I talk to my psychiatrist tomorrow. There will be a lot to talk about, for sure. But I was talking to my mom earlier, and she suggested I try seeing a neurologist.

"Let me preface this by saying that in the past I had been diagnosed but was not on meds and I was an overall shit show. My partner saw a lot of mania, anger and rage during the first few years of our relationship and gave me an ultimate, get care or we arenâ€™t going to be together. It saved our marriage and honestly, me. Iâ€™ve been in treatment for 5 years and have made amazing strides. Iâ€™m super successful in my field and overall a great parent which a lot of those close to me agree. I havenâ€™t been the greatest partner in the past but have worked on that continuously over the years. Our marriage is mostly great. 

Iâ€™ve taken my medication as prescribed and have been super vigilant of my patterns and when I feel like Iâ€™m â€œbeginning to slipâ€ as I phrase it, we discuss it logically. Lately I have been really â€œchecked outâ€ per my partner. Iâ€™ve felt off the past week and mentioned it on Saturday and they agreed. Well on Saturday night they did something which really hurt my feelings. I spent all that night wide awake until 6AM (right before they got up for work). I slept till like 11AM and was exhausted. 

That night, I wrote out a long letter to them. I felt I needed to get it out so that I could rest. I wrote the letter and honestly it was a terrible idea. I shouldâ€™ve slept on it. I gave ultimatums about our relationship and totally discredited myself and my argument for why I was upset. I treated them like absolute shit via the letter. 

Yesterday they were working all day and I did not want to engage via text which I stated in the letter and in a text that morning. Unfortunately, they chose to engage me via text and I didnâ€™t handle it well. Iâ€™ve said some really hateful shit via text and writing over the last 48 hours but we havenâ€™t seen each other or spoken in person. 

I was asleep when they got home last night. I was and still am super exhausted so I slept 10.5 hours last night and woke up 2 hours late for work. Theyâ€™re currently at work and weâ€™re meeting at a coffee shop to discuss once theyâ€™re off. I know I wonâ€™t be aggressive or shitty cause I canâ€™t. 

They asked me to do that for them which I agreed to. The hard part is now Iâ€™m fighting with disassociation. It manifests itself like Iâ€™m on auto-pilot and viewing myself. Iâ€™m also not feeling emotions as I should. I grasp the fact that I fucked up and Iâ€™m there to learn but I probably wonâ€™t be able to discuss how I felt or feel, not that it matters. 

Theyâ€™ve seen the paranoia, mania, anger and depression but theyâ€™ve never seen me disassociate. Iâ€™m numb but I know I fucked up royally. 

Weâ€™ve both been super stressed lately and busy and havenâ€™t seen much of each other lately. I know my needs havenâ€™t been met and I know theirs havenâ€™t either. 

Iâ€™m just disappointed I let myself slip to the point of writing such hateful shit. I shouldâ€™ve let it be. Iâ€™d been doing so well for so very long. I even began exercising and eating right and have lost a ton of weight this year (over 100lbs) and Iâ€™m worried if thatâ€™s whatâ€™s fucking me up with my meds but Iâ€™m not a doctor so I obviously donâ€™t know. 

My meds have been the same for years without a major overhaul.  I reached out to my doctors office and I can be seen Friday at the soonest by an associate of theirs. Iâ€™m super disappointed in myself, Iâ€™ve grown to take it for granted since Iâ€™ve been so consistent for years. Now Iâ€™m just numb and attempting to keep myself busy but Iâ€™m so exhausted. 

I really fucked up this time and Iâ€™m afraid the damage Iâ€™ve done is irreparable. Iâ€™m just going to hear them out and see what they have to say. I wish I could undo this.",bipolar_disorder

sometimes i think it is my fault for maybe flirting for fun. it always ended up sexual and i hated myself for letting it get to that.

I tried to get help once when I was 18, but the dr just gave me diet pills and birth controlâ€¦ so I lost 20 pounds and tried again. And he told me to continue on with my weight-loss. At this point I was staying up for days, binge drinking at least 3 days a week and sleeping around a lot. I lost some more weight and was still depressed but I decided drs were liars by then. 

So since then I've just been kind of riding a roller coaster. I've flunked out of college twice, lost jobs, lost pretty much all of my friends. I've done things that I'm so fucking embarrassed of that I will bring those secrets to the grave. 

I'm in a bad spot again. I'm on disability right now because I almost attempted. I've also started self harming again. 

So I have a new dr that seems to actually listen. He sent out a psych referral for me that I'm still waiting on. I'm hella nervous to meet this dude. When I get nervous I tend to leave things out and say what I think they want to hear so I can leave. I'm also scared that if I tell him I think I'm bipolar he'll think I'm self diagnosing with the internet and not take me seriously.

"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after experiencing psychosis with hallucinations and being hospitalized. Iâ€™m now taking a very small amount of Seroquel (25mg), lithium (300mg), lexapro (20mg), and Lamotrigine (50mg and upping the dose every week) . This was prescribed from my therapist/ psychiatric nurse practitioner. 

I have been waiting to be seen by a renowned psychiatrist for 3 months and I finally had my appointment with him. He told me that lamotrigine will not help prevent manic episodes and the lithium dose is not enough to be therapeutic. I also complained about the lithium giving me horrible acne. 

The psychiatrist suggested that I start amplify and discontinue the lithium and lamotrigine.

When I mentioned this to my therapist, she told me itâ€™s not a good idea to switch medication if Iâ€™m doing well and while Iâ€™m starting a new job. She said she isnâ€™t familiar with amplify (????).

"I went to a Van Gogh Immersive experience with a friend. Art is not something I would say I am not very educated on and often am unable to see beyond 'painting pretty'. Van Gogh is one exception. By coincidence in my formal and informal education, he was the one artist that kept coming up time and time again. Retrospective psychology is a bit controversial in both history and psychology academia but the typical consensus is that Van Gogh most likely had bipolar or similar. I just sat in a room, with his paintings animated around me. Seeing someone who was suffering before we have the treatment options today being able to create such beautiful pieces who would eventually succumb to the thing that may have helped create his art was just an experience that was overwhelming in the best possible way. Being able to sit there and feel things without it becoming an anxiety/panic attack. I never thought I would be able to strike that balance between being a zombie due to my meds, and being overwhelmed to the point of not functioning, but experiencing something that proves those worries wrong was something that felt like actual notable progress.",bipolar_disorder

"Iâ€™m currently living with my (f24) boyfriend (m25) who Iâ€™ve been seeing for about a year. Without getting into it, Iâ€™m unhappy in the relationship and wanna get out. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s the product of mania/depression, as Iâ€™ve been feeling this was for a long while and all of my friends/family have been encouraging me to end the relationship. 

I currently only pay 600$ for half the rent of our studio apartment. Even renting a room where I live can cost 1500$ and I have the added challenge of finding somewhere cat friendly. I could live with my mom for free, but being back at my childhood house and around her triggers a lot of trauma. I have a lot of issues from my childhood, and being home triggers a lot of my CPTSD. 

I already work 6-7 days a week which ends up being 35 hours or so due to some days being shorter. I could work more but I would have to switch jobs. 

I just feel so trapped. I wish I could work full time and afford to get a small room for me and my kitty, but I know itâ€™s going to take some patience to find a space. 


I told my boyfriend I want to end it/leave and heâ€™s trying to convince me otherwise. I donâ€™t want to get sucked back into his manipulations, but I have nowhere to go. Staying with friends would mean being away from all my stuff and cat, which is hard because I work so often, same for shelters.

Iâ€™m sad. 

He completely ignores me and my needs everyday, and is irritated by everything I do, but then when I say I donâ€™t feel cared for he says everything he does is for me. I donâ€™t want it to be, I donâ€™t want him to feel like heâ€™s doing me any favors by just existing as a roommate. I want my own space for the first time in my life.

I was on Lamictal/Lamotrigine for 7 years (250mg). I have started tapering off early this summer and had my final 25mg dose 5 days ago.  I barely had any serious withdrawal symptoms until I did a final reduction to 0mg and now I am not feeling very well at all - having anxiety and feeling lethargic and dizzy. It is also difficult to concentrate and function at work. The only thing that helps temporarily is cardio but I really doubt if it is a great idea to do that. Has anyone experienced something similar and when will it end if ever?,bipolar_disorder
"I've been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 17. My parents even took me to a doctor to get officially diagnosed so I could be put on meds. (I was failing a lot of classes and needed to do better) That doctor told my parents that he suspected I have bipolar disorder, but they ""didn't see the depression"" part of it, and thus dismissed it. 

I know a lot of the symptoms overlap with hypomania. Maybe I have both. But like... maybe what he was seeing was hypomania, but he went with ADHD because my parents were adamant that there was no depression. (I was 17, so they were allowed to talk to him as well.) I realize that's partly on him, because he should have went on what ***I*** told him about how ***I*** was feeling, not my parent's opinion of how I seemed to be feeling..

In their defense, however, I was real damn good at hiding it back then. I didn't want people to see that I was depressed because of the ""I don't have any reason to be depressed"" mentality. Thus, I didn't argue when they told him that. Seems a good part of my misdiagnosis falls on my own dumb decision making. They just thought I was a typical moody teenager, and I guess he we believed them when they told him that. 

For a therapist that doesn't seem like the way you should be handing what the actual patient is telling you. 

All that to say I hate that these things can overlap so much. I just want a definitive answer so I can treat the right thing, but my tendency to lie to doctors and therapists isn't helping me any. Yet some how... I do it anyway, even though I know that. There's this strong instinct to ""not sound crazy"" that takes over my decision making. Because that's what people think. ""Crazy."" I hate that word sometimes.",bipolar_disorder
"And to consistently take them? Is it just something that is common in bipolar folks? Do the meds just suck? I just feel like I'm constantly tweaking my meds because they don't make me feel good.

"So my current psychiatrist has got to go. She has the worst bedside manner of any doctor Iâ€™ve ever seen and makes me feel crazy for my concerns. Recently Iâ€™ve been experiencing dizziness from my Lamictal and it has legitimately made me think I have a brain tumor to which her response was insinuating I had an alcohol problem (I do not), and claiming Iâ€™m taking illicit substances for my anxiety (which Iâ€™m not). Needless to say I am in desperate need of a new psychiatrist and Iâ€™m just wondering what the best course of action would be here. Do I call the office and let them know Iâ€™m seeking treatment else where and to just prescribe maintenance doses until I see someone? Whatâ€™s the move here?",bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™ve been going through some really tough stuff through all of 2022. My sister recently left her partner and has been staying with us for months while she puts her life back together, she brought her dog which doesnâ€™t do well for my cats, and sheâ€™s been neglecting, so my husband and I have been the caretakers that we donâ€™t really want to be. 

I feel extremely overwhelmed with the house and the chores (my husband works super long hours so Iâ€™ve always been the primary on that front but Iâ€™m exhausted and have no desire to. My cats and chickens are paying the price which makes me feel extremely guilty and has me considering giving them away so they get better care. 

I had worked for 4 years with a very close friend of mine helping with his nonprofit to find out that he has been embezzling money the whole time, and have been forced into the role of cleaning up the mess and have put in a hundred hours so far with about another hundred to go. The friendship that I used to spend at least 2 days a week visiting with is over and I am struggling with that loss while also being extremely disgusted and hopeless about humanity because I canâ€™t believe that I was getting lied to and deceived this whole time. 

Iâ€™ve ramped up work because we just got back from a European vacation we were saving hardcore for, and pushed my body and my brain way too hard for my TBI. 

I struggle with bipolar disorder and have been swinging much more than usual given this level of stress. I feel like I am a burden to my family and husband because I spend most of my time ranting  and processing out loud and feel like they donâ€™t deserve it. I am not my best self right now and I know it. I know it is taking an emotional toll on them too. I feel guilty that I have no capacity to act differently and have been extremely depressed with no way for them to help me. 

I want to be alone right now. I donâ€™t want to leave my husband at all, he is great, but I feel like I want to not be around anyone. I want to get grounded and re-center. In the past Iâ€™ve done road trips to visit family or friends and it allows me time to process and not have responsibilities for a short time and it really helped.

With my two jobs I donâ€™t feel like this is an option anymore. Iâ€™m at the point where I feel like quitting them both even though I know thatâ€™s something that I really shouldnâ€™t do. 

If I left for a while I know my husband would have to take the brunt of the responsibilities which he really canâ€™t do, so my options are potentially to stay home with the animals and ask him to be the one to leave but that also seems fucked up.

"So I have bipolar one disorder, and usually when Iâ€™m under stress thatâ€™s when things start to unravel so to speak. I recently had a relationship end about six months ago. It lasted a year and I found out that he was talking to someone else. Needless to say it sent me into a depression and at that point I started to hear things and become delusional. I got put on antipsychotics for it. Fast forward six months later and Iâ€™m still having trouble forgiving. But that wasnâ€™t what my issue was yesterday. My issue was that I was on my deck and all of a sudden I start to cry and say to myself â€œitâ€™s the same sh!t all the time. Iâ€™m tired of feeling the same shit all the time.â€ After about five ish minutes of weeping by myself outside, I immediately started to talk about my hair how I should cut it, and about my video game that I started playing. I go back inside the house and Iâ€™m still yapping. That must have went on for about 20 min. I had to stop myself in the middle of talking, I looked around and said â€œIâ€™m alone arenâ€™t I?â€ I was legit talking to myself and didnâ€™t realize it til I realized no one was talking back.

"just went to a concert for one of my favorite bands on Saturday with my best friend in the world, drank a good amount that night and normally I drink on Sundays too but I was so hungover I didnâ€™t.

Crying at work right now, and just feel like a mess despite sleeping in and not drinking since Saturday. Have had horrible, physically jarring nightmares both nights.

"Hi everyone, I just want to start out by saying that I am not taking this as any kind of medical advice if thatâ€™s a concern. I have made an appointment with my doctor, where I will discuss this in detail.

I recently had an experience where I heard sound to be distorted, as in creepily distorted to put it mildly. I donâ€™t think it qualifies as a hallucination since the auditory stimulus was present in the environment. I donâ€™t believe that this occurred because I just had something in my ear, or anything of that nature.

Iâ€™ve looked up to see if this symptom matches with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, but I didnâ€™t really find anything specific to auditory illusions, just auditory hallucinations.

If someone knows any links to scientific articles that explain this subject in further detail I would greatly appreciate it.

Iâ€™m going to see my doctor soon, but I would like to know as much on the topic as possible so I can describe it to her more accurately.

Thank you and have a great day.",bipolar_disorder

"Half of my medication is ready to pick up, the other half hasnâ€™t been filled yet.  The pharmacist apparently just straight up quit over the weekend.  They have trouble keeping their staff at this pharmacy, so Iâ€™m not surprised, but I am freaking out. 

I called an other pharmacy to see if they can fill but now there is tons of issues.  Because they filled half the prescription, the pharmacy is seeing the medication as â€œcompleteâ€ and they donâ€™t want to give me an other bottle of lithium because one is already waiting for me, but they canâ€™t let me pick it up because there is no pharmacist! 

They are willing to refill seroquel, but not ritalin which is understandable, but they are also refusing to refill my birth control for the same reason as my lithium, itâ€™s ready, itâ€™s waiting for pickup. 

So now Iâ€™ll have to travel over 2 hours to pick up seroquel, but Iâ€™m stuck without lithium.  Guys Iâ€™m scared.

Well back in the spring I started having seizures, Grand Mal seizures.  It got really bad over the summer, I was having them once or twice a week.  I found a neurologist when I had my first seizure, but she told me that I was having seizures because I'm overweight.  Last I knew weight had nothing to do with seizures.  Everything turned into I need to lose weight and I need to go exercise etc.  I decided I don't want to see her anymore so I found another neurologist.  Turns out in the state of Ohio you can only be active at one neurologist at a time, so in order to get a new neurologist I have to get the first one to drop me as a patient.  This doctor won't drop me because I told her receptionist that she was rude.  She said ""If I'm that rude then I wont let you leave my practice.""  My boss told me that if I don't have a note from a neurologist he doesn't believe that I'm having seizures and I'm just being lazy and not wanting to come into work.  I also have vertigo so I have balance issues, I'm pretty much always dizzy and light headed no matter what I do.  I was told if I don't get that note I'll lose my job.  I've been trying to get a note since July, I've told him this and it still doesn't matter.  I even collapsed one day at work because I was so dizzy.  He was in the room and he just stood there and watched me struggle.

The vice principal of the school has this thing for finding the smallest flaws in my work, I mean it's even down to the way I wipe down a table.

Today I had to go home to take my anti-seizure medication because I forgot to take it before I left home in the morning, I have a split shift at work so I have an hour and half between my two shifts.  I usually take my medicine in the morning before I leave for work for the day so I don't get dizzy at work.  Well I had to leave for 10 minutes so I could go home to get that medicine.  I've been told my job hours are 11:20-1:45 since the day I started.  Well today I got there at about 11:13 after running home for my medicine.  The kindergarten teachers took their kids out to go to the lunchroom 7 minutes early, so I was trying to park my car and get inside before my shift started.  Well this lady came up to me and told me to park somewhere else, even though we have assigned spots at my job and I was just trying to get to my spot. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get an email from the VP saying that I wasn't back until after 11:20 and I put the kids in danger by driving in the parking lot while they were passing through to get to the playground.  I responded to him by saying if it's necessary they can adjust my pay to match the time missed, and that the time on my car when I got back was 11:13. I got an email back from him saying that I'm being disrespectful to the administration at the school.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm being disrespectful for doing my job as stated in my job description and answering a question the vice principal asked me.  Whenever any of the monitors get in trouble at work for doing something, it always comes down to it being my responsibility.  For example, I stay inside with the kids and lunch and a different set of monitors watches them outside while they're at recess.  One of the outdoor monitors did something to make the kids upset and it was taken out on me, even though I'm not outside at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from having a seizure in front of the VP I don't know what else I can do.  I feel targeted and singled out by him.  I'm tired of him telling everyone at the school I'm faking having seizures because I want to be lazy and sit at home and watch TV.  They don't know I'm bipolar and I'm definitely not telling them that if they can't be professional about the seizures.",bipolar_disorder

Today my provider has switched me too Adderral XR 30MG x2 a day. (I work up to 14 Hours.) Iâ€™m currently waiting for my insurance to approve the request for Adderrallâ€¦

My question is, who here is on Adderrall, and how has it worked for you?

Thanks!",bipolar_disorder
"Hey everyone. Iâ€™m going to ramble for a minute so I apologize in advance. 

I was my Nurse Practitionerâ€™s first patient when she was done orienting with my old psychiatric doc. I switched to her because the doctor and I didnâ€™t really vibe (He was abrupt, didnâ€™t remember my history ever and routinely made me bring up and relive past trauma, minimize my trauma, you get the gist).

At first I felt pretty defensive with her, then kinda like she understood me? She started diagnosing me, putting me on medications, it was great! I was getting answers and putting my life on track. She went through like 4 different diagnoses and treatments, and this most recent one (bipolar) actually matched what one psych doctor had thought I might have years ago.

Bipolar makes sense to me! I feel like I understand everyone elseâ€™s stories, my husband says he sees the traits in me. I brought that up at my most recent appointment and sheâ€™s like â€œWhat? No, youâ€™re not diagnosed with that. Iâ€™m not sure, Iâ€™m kinda 50/50 you might have bipolar 2 (sorry if thatâ€™s incorrect) or you might have borderline personality disorder.â€

So i essentially feel like the last year and a half of being treated by her has been a waste. I keep getting these temporary â€˜diagnosesâ€™ and feeling like Iâ€™m finally starting to understand my life, then the next appointment itâ€™s like that never happened. 

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m asking for here and Iâ€™m sorry for rambling. Thanks for reading, Iâ€™d you got this far.",bipolar_disorder
"Just a little rant.. Iâ€™ve explained to my boyfriend (of 5 months) that I canâ€™t control my moods while in an episode. I try, I do my best, but thereâ€™s only so much I can do to â€œcontainâ€ myself. He knows my last two episodes have been bad. Mild psychosis (just seeing little things move that arenâ€™t suppose to. Little things in the corner of my eyes. â€œMildâ€). feeling glitchy, pulling all nighters, rapid cycling, etc.. He gets upset when I mention that he doesnâ€™t really understand how bad it is for me and says things like â€œI talk to you all day everyday, and youâ€™re saying I donâ€™t understandâ€. Gets SO upset. Anyway, Iâ€™ve been in this roller coaster episode for over a week now and Iâ€™m irritable, snappy and with a frail temper. Iâ€™ve communicated this and yet he is still so nit picky.. Has no issue causing arguments and thinks Iâ€™m mistreating him the way I talk to him. Today for instanceâ€¦ I TOLD him I was happy and a little cocky and was just just â€˜vibingâ€™. He starts this small argument, something that could have been over within 10 minutes. It last 45 MINUTES. Iâ€™m getting worked up, mood has switched and I tell him I canâ€™t feed into it and will talk to him later. He keeps going, keeps egging me on, wants the last say. I start dishing it back. Fast forward, I get a text from him hours later telling me I canâ€™t talk to him like that and I canâ€™t use bipolar as an excuse to treat him poorlyâ€¦.. Iâ€™m exhausted. Itâ€™s very clear he DOESNâ€™T get it. I donâ€™t have control over this when in a manic state and I try to step away to avoid things like this. Itâ€™s just tiring. It happens every time and he then uses my words against me once Iâ€™ve come down. Dating is exhausting when the other person is short tempered and just. Doesnâ€™t. Get it.

"Hello all. Some backstory: Iâ€™ve had the same group of friends since university (5 of us in the group). Iâ€™ve dealt with mental illness in general since my teens but was diagnosed BP2 at 25. Iâ€™m now 29. 

This year has been one of the worst in terms of mental health. I had a hypomanic episode in the spring followed by a crash into depression. A few weeks of stability went by but I became depressed again about a month and a half ago. Iâ€™ve been off work on two occasions this year (including now) and been to the ER a couple of times, and Iâ€™m waiting for my referral to go through to see a psychiatrist again.

All of this to say - itâ€™s been a bad year. One of the things Iâ€™ve been working on in therapy for the last few years is learning to reach out for support when I need it. I tend to make myself suffer alone. So this year I kept my friend group in the loop about my struggles and leaned on them when needed.

This past month theyâ€™ve all distanced themselves from me. They donâ€™t ask how Iâ€™m doing, or if I want to hang out. Iâ€™m ignored sometimes in our group chat. The most Iâ€™ve gotten out of them is a â€œhope you feel better soon!â€. I feel very alone. My husband thinks I should start to move on from them a bit, I do have a couple of other friends who Iâ€™ve known for a lesser amount of time who have checked on me. But Iâ€™m mourning that loss of friendship. We were so close. This is just really hard to come to terms with.

This post was way longer than I had intended - oops. Just wondering if anyone has dealt with something similar and who did you turn to after for support? Thanks for reading.",bipolar_disorder
"I need some help. In May, I started talking with a man I met on a social media website. We have many similar interests, a lot in common, and we both appreciate the small things about one another. Everything was great until, out of nowhere, he ghosted me for months. A few weeks before he ghosted, he had told me he has bipolar disorder. I have other friends who are bipolar and I have never had an issue with communication with them. I myself have BPD. But he was just gone. I was completely crushed. I blamed myself for pushing him away. Then, all of a sudden, this man reached out to apologize and l, with some thought, accepted. I have made many mistakes and have done many things Iâ€™m not proud of. Forgiveness was an easy choice. But now, I believe Iâ€™m being ghosted again. My question is: could this be because heâ€™s bipolar and going through something or is he just not a nice person that I need to drop? Thanks.",bipolar_disorder

"My house was originally in the bullseye for hurricane ianâ€™s landfall. Last second it shifted ~40 miles south and made landfall there. I was convinced our house wouldnâ€™t make it, weâ€™re less than a mile from the shore and had mandatory evacs. When we came home our house was untouched. Literally. Not even any branches in the yard.

I feel so damn guilty for it. When we evacuated I think it triggered a mood swing and spent at least 400 dollars on stupid shit from etsy and plushies. Iâ€™ve been bouncing between rage and crying over this. Idk I feel like I shouldnâ€™t be upset at all because our house was perfectly ok but some of my friends down south literally donâ€™t have houses anymore.

"I got out of hospital September 2nd. Sick, queasy, mentally dull and unwell. I had to go from pill antipsychotics to the injectable because, well, I stopped taking it but couldnâ€™t tell the truth about it.

I was lucky enough to get my job back with no FMLA. Iâ€™ve got probation. I had my first injectable appointment and now have a copay assistance in place. My biological family is relatively close knit, still.

Sometimes we never really come out of the hospitals the same. The ambition is off, things feel empty, or thereâ€™s something we just canâ€™t get past. It changes you. This is where the injectable gave me hope.

I have a relative stable medication line up now, which is allowing me to tackle eating habits and weight. Thatâ€™ll allow me to tackle having an apprenticeship interview. All that will, collectively, help keep me out of the hospital via my support network.

If you can stabilize your medication, all this other stuff is doable. Donâ€™t kid yourself. Enough wallowing in the abyss. Enough drudgery and complaining about what canâ€™t be. Letâ€™s celebrate the opportunities that we donâ€™t know are waiting for us. They most certainly are there.

"anyone else very irritated by the mundane?

One of my biggest daily problems, and what I see as fueling depression, or like, turning my hypomania into mixed episodes is the constant irritation I experience by the mundane routines of everyone around me, especially the ones with a sensory component (say, sounds of footsteps back and forth, eating noises, habits like sitting in a spot blocking off access, common areas in the room always being occupied by someone else, etc). Its like the theme is ""big picture stuff is okay, if you have a problem come to me, and we'll take on the life challenge, but don't you DARE minorly inconvenience me and make me pay attention to something I find too trivial to give a shit about"".

It's just, like....I swear I'm a pleasant enough person in a more external setting, where there is an implicit understanding you have your own space and they have their own and you're free to leave if someone's fumbling around bugs you. However, I find myself fucking detesting people I share living quarters with, even if I don't personally have anything against them; I just find it almost insulting to be disturbed sensorily by other people's mundane nonsense. 


I think irritability is a symptom of mania and this annoyance tracks with my mood cycling so I'm running it by the people here (though also I suffer chronic pain so I have sensory sensitivities and a shortened fuse due to it). I wonder if anyone else experiences something similar or has any advice how to handle it.",bipolar_disorder

I've been with my partner for 7 years and I made the mistake of thinking I could be honest with him. I really believed he was open and understanding after he had demonstrated that he had researched my condition and read up on it. Tonight I let down my walls and was honest about what I was feeling..he freaked out. I was made to feel small and stupid. I don't know if I can forgive this. I am so tired and I feel so betrayed. How can you ask me to be myself with you and then attack me for it? I only expressed my apprehension at starting a new job and the anxiety I felt because of things the employer had said. He acted like I was attempting to sabotage the job and rejecting it outright. All I did was express my feelings and what his behavior showed me was that I was not safe.

"I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about a year ago. Was prescribed lamictal and felt amazing. I was so depressed before and after a couple months of adjusting my dosage I finally started to feel â€œnormalâ€ (lol). I have always suffered from anxiety and what I now realize is paranoia. My dr then prescribed me buspar and Ativan to use as needed. My anxiety continued to get worse and worse over these past couple months. The intrusive thoughts are awful, itâ€™s so hard to be in public and socialize with people. Then I started to have even more symptoms. Constantly convinced Iâ€™ve done things I havenâ€™t done, paranoid people are following me when Iâ€™m driving or that Iâ€™ve ran someone over. Itâ€™s come to the point itâ€™s making me genuinely miserable and depressed. I feel crazy. I finally told my psychiatrist all the details and he decided to up my buspar and have me take klonopin daily. When that didnâ€™t work he chose to prescribe me abilify. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m terrified to take this. Iâ€™ve never been on an antipsychotic before and it genuinely scares me. Anyone see success in paranoia / intrusive thoughts by taking abilify?

My current meds are 150 mg lamictal twice a day. .5mg klonopin every morning, 10 mg of buspar 3 times a day. And now I will start 5 mg of ability at night.

i try to embrace boredom. and living in a remote place means there isnt much to do after dark so i just go to bed. 

i live in employee housing so im not alone and thats been really nice too. 

being in a remote place also means there are no restaurants, so im forced to plan meals and cook, something ive never done i just eat take out usually.

"TLDR: Had a breakdown after a night out and feel as though my suspicion that the people in my life only care as long as I donâ€™t bother them.

I had a really rough night a few weeks ago. Now to start this off my birthday is in August and usually that month is the worst for my depression. This year however I was doing really well but maybe I was pushing it to the side. But on the weekend after my birthday I went to the club with some friends and I was perfectly fine all night, maybe a little irritable but Iâ€™m introverted so it happens. Since probably June I had something I had to do every weekend and it was starting to take a toll on me. 
After bar close we were heading back to the cars and thatâ€™s when one of our friends asked me if it was okay if he took my brother back to his house which I said I didnâ€™t mind. Here is where the problem begins. 

To truly explain the situation I have to go back in time quite a bit. Me and this friend, including the other friend have had a rocky past. Having long stints of time that I didnâ€™t talk to them due to different reasons. Of course those have been put behind usâ€¦ kind of. Iâ€™ve been told before that people treat me differently because of my tendency to snap (before I was diagnosed and started taking medication). Since hearing that I have felt that Iâ€™m on the outskirts of the group and only tolerated because they like my brother. My brother his a whole different story, we are best friends weâ€™re raised like twins (we arenâ€™t twins) so our sense of self is only connected to one another. There is also a bit of an inferiority complex. 

So when my friend asked if they could take my brother (whole came with me) back with them it hit me really wrong. At first I was angry, I got in my car stewing over this but it was quickly replaced with sadness. Why would anyone want me around, they donâ€™t even really like me. Something I felt was later confirmed. As while I sobbed in my car I sent off a message to my friends that I suppose could sound suicidal adjacent. I ended up calling my mom and she talked to me the entire time that I drove out to her house at 2-3am. Of course she talked me down and by about 6am I drove home. Since leaving for my moms house till the next afternoon I didnâ€™t talk to anyone. Yet no one messaged me to see if I was okay or even still alive. Not even my brother. (Which hit even hard because one night I didnâ€™t go out one of the friends called me at 3am because they couldnâ€™t find my brother and were worried about him so I ended up having to drive around the city until I found him and got him home. I donâ€™t get the same consideration.) Of course eventually, about a week later, I went back to talking to everyone, acted like it never happened and they do the same. 

Emotionally Iâ€™m doing better now but it has become very clear that I have no one to turn to. I donâ€™t get any support from my friends and family (this was an outlier with my mom but has gotten her to talk to me more than once every few weeks to months). Everyone in my life care as long as I keep it hidden. So honestly Iâ€™m doing better but the whole situation continues to upset me. 

Iâ€™m trying to act normal but I just donâ€™t want to see my friends anymore.",bipolar_disorder

This time around it was the bad idea of deciding to drive to the woods to camp overnight, leaving my house at 2:30 AM and making enough noise to accidentally wake up my roommates which I feel embarrassed and bad about.",bipolar_disorder
Im a sophomore in college and was diagnosed severe bipolar 1 with mixed episodes. I lost my mind a few months ago in a full blown manic episode with psychotic features. I mean I seriously lost my mind and havenâ€™t felt the same since. I wake up everyday and for one second the world is ok until it all hits me again. I was in two partial hospitalization programs over the summer with people of all ages still struggling. Everyone reminds me Iâ€™m not alone but that doesnâ€™t change the fact that we were all suffering. Iâ€™m so tired like to my core I am exhausted. I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want to live like this forever.,bipolar_disorder
"I've shared my dumbest manic idea on here in another post. I've decided to share another dumb manic idea I've had in the past. This one is kinda funny (at least to me). 

My bipolar started when I was around 17. I believe I was manic when it was time to enroll for classes for senior year, otherwise I wouldn't have enrolled in AP Stats. It's not that I did bad in my math classes. It's just that, for one thing, I was also planning on taking College Algebra, and for another, I struggled with pre-cal. I got a good grade in pre-cal, but that was only because I studied hard. Only manic grandiosity could have led me to believe AP Stats was a good idea. 

At the beginning of the school year, I struggled. It was basic concepts too, but it was boring to me, and I got an F on the very first exam, while most of everyone else got A's. I felt like an utter failure. I made it a point to try harder. I wasn't going to be defeated by math! So, I studied more. I was still only getting B's and C's, but, lucky for me, the other students were starting to do just as bad, if not worse. So, the teacher started curving the grades. 

Toward the end of the year, we had moved on to more complicated concepts, one of them being linear programming. Linear programming is a misnomer, because it actually has nothing to do with programming at all. I don't know how to explain it well, because, honestly, I don't remember much about it anymore. But, I do remember getting manic again around this time. So, I was staying up at all hours of the night (unbeknownst to my mom) playing Harvest Moon. I became obsessed with these linear programming problems and began using them to calculate how many of each crop to grow in Harvest Moon to maximize my profits. Needless to say, I got an A on that exam, even without the curve. Most of everyone else had failed or gotten a D. 

I did end up failing the AP exam for that class at the end of the year, but I passed the class with a good grade, thanks to a generous grading scale! Some manic ideas work out, some don't, and some are just questionable. This one worked out, I suppose. I didn't get college credit for the class, but I didn't need it. I still graduated a semester early anyway.",bipolar_disorder
"I have been going up on Lamictal and just hit 100mg this week. The last 2 weeks I've been definitely hypomanic: painting my walls, buying everything and anything, got a bearded dragon, going to bars alone, wandering around the city at 4am alone, running, pacing and talking so fast others can't understand me. I am redoing my whole kitchen and I'll speed around driving for hours in the middle of the night. I have been running on 4 hours a sleep a night. My Psychiatrist has basically ghosted me. I have emailed her twice over the last 2 weeks and no response. My Psychologist has also called and left 3 messaged for my psychiatrist since she is concerned and still nothing. So I am getting a new doctor but it takes months to get an appt. I have been starting to feel on and off again tired. Like i am wiring still, racing thoughts but my body is so tired and exhausted. I have so many ideas and energy but also feel like I am half asleep while functioning in the world and I want to cry but cant. I am all shaking but also feel myself craving sleep but then I am suddenly on top of the world for a few hours and then I am down again.

"Long time lurker and upvoter on my main account... But I have to rant somehow, hence a second account. ðŸ˜…

I'm on 10mg of Aripiprazole and 60mg of Duloxetine. And I've developed (confirmed by GP) Drug Induced Parkinsonism. So I shake... Constantly, unrelentingly and now painfully... My arms are so exhausted that they hurt when they shake, just texting hurts. I feel useless and miserable about it, as well as in a depressive episode (I have a lot going on). I struggle to eat, write, and just relax... Even sleep, as the shaking keeps me awake. 

I usually live in the US, but I'm currently in the UK til the new year, and getting anything done will take weeks... Even seeing a private psychiatrist to change my medication so I maybe stop shaking... But I don't know how much more of this I can take. 

I miss having a spring in my step and having a personality other than ""meh, alright."" I'm trying really hard to do more and be more. But it's getting exhausting.

"Iâ€™m losing my mindâ€¦and my temper often. I think I was having auditory hallucinations last night. Itâ€™s been a minute since Iâ€™ve had that happen and it always truly terrifies me. My fiancÃ© and I were laying in bed and it sounded  like a neighbor in our building was having a full on party. It felt deafening. My fiancÃ© swore he didnâ€™t hear anything but I was so convinced thereâ€™s was loud music. Not like a song stuck in your head. Usually in the past itâ€™s always been quick whispers in my head that I canâ€™t make out. Nothing so loud and so so real. 

Iâ€™m also so crabby. Probably also cause I have  some awful respiratory infection and for some reason canâ€™t keep food down. But being off my bipolar medication isnâ€™t helping me either.

I know I need to restart my medication. Last time I went off of them my fiancÃ© (then boyfriend) left me. So it just feels like Iâ€™m on borrowed time till Iâ€™m alone again. But I also donâ€™t want to get back on my meds. I need to lose weight for a needed surgery and maybe I could actually lose weight instead of gain if I was off my meds. I donâ€™t know. I guess Iâ€™m just rambling now. 

I think I mostly came here to say that last night scared me. I donâ€™t want to end back up in the psych ward, mostly for financial reasons. And Iâ€™m worried my fiancÃ© is going to leave again.",bipolar_disorder
"Possible **\*\*TRIGGER WARNING\*\***

Idk, as soon as you tell someone you have bipolar disorder, many react in different ways but many times people look at you like a criminal. Me being young and naive (8 years ago), I told my coworkers that I had bipolar disorder, their first reaction was to ""hide the knives, because she might hurt someone"". I worked in shipping so we had quite a bit a knives. Like who the f am I hurting? The only person would be myself. And they would sometimes refuse to work the same shift as me because they were afraid of me. 

Another time, I was in high school and was having a bad depressive episode so I ran away from school to clear my head. Police were issued a man-hunt for me. I eventually came back on my own but was sent to the school's ""interrogation"" room and was told that I ""was a waste of police resources"". I felt like a waste on society. Made me really struggle to accept my bipolar disorder. 

I have a lot of trauma with mental hospitals. I sometimes wake up crying because of it. First time I was at a mental hospital, I was 12. Psychiatrist told me that I could trust her and she would not tell anyone about how I was feeling or my past. Well guess what, she tells my parents everything in detail. Broke my trust. Against my will and my parents, I was admitted and remember people yelling at me to strip. The classic ""squat and cough"". Locked in my room screaming and crying for days with no food. Other girls taunting you, humiliating you. I know it's nothing like prison but I felt like I was a prisoner. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. It feels like a secret I have to keep forever and hope that nobody finds out. Sorry if this is a bit of a long rant, had a nightmare last night which caused me to have bad flashbacks this morning, so I'm kinda spiraling out of control this morning.",bipolar_disorder
"Hi everyone,

This is my first Reddit post ever. I wanted to ask 2 questions that are unrelated: 

**1st) has anyone here experienced mania due to taking anti-psychotics?** I was diagnosed\* with bipolar II and i started going to this mental urgent care clinic for several months. Although different doctors gave me different meds, they always gave me an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer. I eventually found a psychiatrist and he didn't want to give me lithium or any mood stabilizer and instead prescribed me an anti-psychotic. With the anti-depressant + antipsychotic, i started experiencing intense irritation but also feeling like i was the shit. Prior to this i never had a manic episode, only hypermania. It got to the point where i felt disconnected from what was real and what wasn't, and crazy mood swings where i'm super happy and then start crying in inappropriate places (inside a busy bus, between customers as a cashier). I stopped taking medication because of this and other negative experiences. Also the last 2 months when I started really losing control, the dr had stopped prescribing me antidepressants.

**2nd) Has anyone ever stopped feeling symptoms after making healthy lifestyle changes?** A few months after I stopped taking meds, I made these huge lifestyle changes and I started eating healthy and exercising for the first time in my life. I felt like all of my mood disorder problems went away and even now at 27 I still haven't experienced those old patterns even though i fell into some bad habits again. 

Thank you in advance to everyone that takes the time to answer, even if it's just one question or just about your own experience. The anti-psychotic i took i can't remember the name but it started with a T.

Thank you,

Jennifer

\* I put an asterisk after diagnosed because I wasn't officially diagnosed. I was seeing a psychologist at school for several wks/months who believed that I may have it and urged me to seek medical attention. At the urgent care, they listened to what I said and prescribed me meds, same with the psychiatrist, but neither were in depth like the psychologist. I feel like this diagnosis was accurate based on my experience of going through months of depression followed by moments of intense happiness and recklessness, although never to the degree of a full blown manic episode. I've had these experiences since I was 13/14 and I began looking for medical help when I was 19. Also when I took the mood stabilizer by itself, I felt emotionless and with the antidepressants by themselves, i would start getting kind of manic. Both felt dangerous.",bipolar_disorder
"I've been bipolar all of my life but just started medication and therapy at the beginning of the year. It's made major improvements for my mood but has worsened some of my issues with memory and focus. I'm sort of at a crossroads right now of hating the meds, but hating the moods I was feeling, too. So, I don't want to quit them, but then I do. 

Yesterday I realized I dropped the ball on some work stuff and got into a little trouble. I am a researcher and have noticed that I can't even remember my work products. Has anyone else faced some of these issues with work? Do you tell your employer or try to keep it under control? I'm not sure if I want to disclose that I'm bipolar, but it may be helpful to disclose that I have an illness affecting my memory and concentration. Or have you had experiences that have created an uncomfortable environment? 

Hoping to poll the group to see what the best solution is for me... I really have been passionate about my job and don't want to quit working but bipolar has made it increasingly difficult as I've gotten older.",bipolar_disorder
"I believe I might be suffering from delusions of reference? I suffer with these delusions . And let me explain how it ended up biting me in the behind. For years, I have based everything on it being a â€œsignâ€ for me. Or meant for me. And Iâ€™m only talking about fictional stories, from video games and anime, and movies. Nothing from religious texts.

Well, living 30 years like this used to be fun. Getting over excited about a video games story, and thinking â€œwow! this is sooo relatable to what Iâ€™m going through! this was meant for me.â€ 

this was fun for years, thinking everything was meant for me. And it made that game feel â€œmore specialâ€ to me than others because I believed it was meant for me. 

Until one day, I played a game during a time when I was getting intrusive thoughts (OCD) about my religion.

And now it went from everything being a sign my whole life, to
â€œwait, I donâ€™t want this to be a sign or meaningâ€ due to how horrific it is and how it goes completely against my religious and life outlook / beliefs

Now, I have become obsessed with this. I have tried ERP for it because I thought it was only OCD, but it feels like itâ€™s something more than just that.

So now instead of getting excited when I see â€œsimilaritiesâ€ in a video game story, or anime, instead of getting excited over it, I get terrified because it reminds me of the one time I felt like not accepting a â€œsignâ€ from a video game story I played, due to it supporting my intrusive thoughts I had during that time.

I began taking Risperidone just this week, my doctor prescribed it to me.  

How do I recovery from living my whole life thinking every thing I read or saw in these fictional video game or anime stories were a sign, but the one time when a â€œsignâ€ happened and it went against my core belief, I rejected this â€œsignâ€ but it wonâ€™t let me go. It keeps screaming at me to figure it out. It keeps wanting me to believe in it the way I did before with â€œsignsâ€ from fictional stories my whole life. And it calls me a hypocrite for believing in signs before in my life, but not this one time when it went against my core beliefs.

I feel so trapped.

Even when I now see things like a familiar name appear in a video game or anime, I panic, and I hear voices telling me that this is further proof of the sign you are rejecting, the one that went against your core life/religious beliefs.

Iâ€™ve always thought video game stories, anime stories, movies, all had special meanings for me. Like I was meant to watch it at that exact time in my life and it was advice I was meant to hear right then. But the one time I decided to reject â€œa signâ€ was when I played a game that fed into some intrusive thoughts that went against my core beliefs.

And now since then, itâ€™s been a living hell. I keep being reminded of it. I keep being told itâ€™s a sign. I keep being told I canâ€™t accept the truth. I keep being told Iâ€™m a hypocrite for accepting â€œsignsâ€ all my life, but not this one. I keep being told it was meant for me to play that game during that time, and for me to hear that games story and the way it goes against my core religious beliefs. 

Itâ€™s a nightmare when I try to go back to enjoying video game stories or anime stories. Because I canâ€™t even focus on the story. Iâ€™m just being reminded of the one time I rejected a â€œsignâ€ from a video game story. And when I see other similarities in them, I panic because the thoughts remind me about the one time I didnâ€™t feel like accepting â€œa signâ€",bipolar_disorder
"TL;DR: my friend was surprised at how many medications I take for my bipolar disorder and it didnâ€™t sit right with me 

I was diagnosed at 17, now 25. Treatment is hard. You go through so many medications and therapists and psychiatrists, they all try different meds, different doses, different coping strategies. Iâ€™ve learned a lot over the course of 7 years, truly. Recently, I was off of meds for about a year and a half. Even with insurance it was around $600/$700 a month for everything. Then I got a new job that required a commute, my psychiatrist stopped practicing and left me with no referrals. This all sorta did fine, for about a year. The last 6 months have been horrible, all culminating about a week ago with me having a massive panic attack at work and texting my boss that I quit. Not great, not great. I have been trying for months to get a new psychiatrist, but again, even with insurance and a well paying FT job, the cost was just insane PLUS the waitlist for places is agonizing. I got lucky, my roommate has family that is a retiring NP and they got me back on a few of the meds I used to take, which I picked up yesterday!! Yay!! So fucking excited to feel more in control of my emotions and reactions! I sent a pic to my friend of my med bottles being so excited that I was finally back on track to being mentally healthy. He texted back â€œthatâ€™s a lot of meds ðŸ˜³.â€ There were 3 yall. 3. Usually I have 5, but the NP canâ€™t prescribe controlled substances. â€œA lotâ€ he said. I donâ€™t know why, but that really fucked me up. I never replied, I donâ€™t plan to. Itâ€™s hard to celebrate your steps when no one around you understands what your mental illness does to you. I hope someone, anyone read this. 3 cheers for being back on meds, which I will take WITH FOOD and water instead of coffee and an empty stomach (thatâ€™s what we call progress.)",bipolar_disorder

"Hey,

I had a prescriber who I adored: listened to me, made availability to see me sooner in very rough times etc. 

She fell ill and is in an extended hiatus, possibly permanent. 

I found a new prescriber. He cuts me off when I begin to talk about anything even relatively in the therapy realm - even if it's (what I believe to be) pertinent information. He is only willing to see me a maximum of once a month even when my therapist thinks I should be seen every two to three weeks. 

I have a lot of comorbidities and even while I expressed my main concern is my relatively new Bipolar II diagnosis/dealing with near constant, extreme lows - he decided to focus on my agoraphobia instead. 

He gave me one new med for my agoraphobia and sent me on my way. 

I want to up my lamictal and add an antidepressant. I'm at 225mg of lamictal - a dose he said was ""practically maxed out"" yet I've seen a lot of people with doses in ranges of 600. 

I'm on seven different meds and only one of them is for Bipolar II, all others are for agoraphobia. Of course I want to beat my agoraphobia but what is the point in working on getting out of the house if I'm so low I can't get out of the fucking bed?

Itâ€™s been pretty devastating to observe myself move deeper into the compulsion, and watch it affect my life.

If youâ€™re giving up something, give it up for x days. Try sharing x details with a provider instead of all the problems at once.

The goal is to get ahead by a couple of inches before you move on to feet. Cut it into 1/4 or 1/8 if you have to. But getting small wins like that is a big deal, even if it doesnâ€™t seem like it.

The man I fell in love with is the sweetest, kindest, most open minded and romantic individual. I love him to bits. We get along so great, weâ€™re like best friends. He canâ€™t keep his hands off me. But when he has a episode he almost wants nothing to do with me. While I completely understand that he canâ€™t help this, I just need to know how to handle these episodes. I love him and Iâ€™m willing to stand by him, I just need some guidance",bipolar_disorder
This guy is one of the best in the Uk. First thing he said to me was stop caffeine and alcohol (probably other things but they donâ€™t relate to me). I didnâ€™t quite understand all the scientific technical stuff but he thinks itâ€™s something to do with the mitochondria and that these substances can effect it. Heâ€™s also concerned about the amount of deaths that can happen due to heart issues with bipolars but he says this is because of stress (I donâ€™t know how accurate that is). Last year I was rapidly cycling a lot with mania. Weird thing is I donâ€™t get depressed. I definitely relate a lot to it but I donâ€™t think I have had full blown depression in over 15 years. I am definitely not the confident extroverted guy I once was but I am fairly content most of the time when Iâ€™m not anxious about something. Anyway Iâ€™ve not had a manic episode since seeing him 10 months ago so something must be going right. If I relapse I have to see him and he will prescribe these drugs to do with thyroid (he thinks mania is due to thyroid issues normally). He offers EMSR (sp?) too but I donâ€™t know if I need that yet,bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™ve levelled out on my meds and reached a level of stability that is good for my family and my job. 

But Iâ€™d be lying if I didnâ€™t mention the reduced memory, the emotional blunting and that I miss things like bursts of creativity when hypomanic. 

Society tells me I need to stay medicated to remain productive and be a good capitalist. I donâ€™t prefer one state over the other but I can see how stable people end up going off their medication. I miss feeling â€¦ genuine. Everything now feels dull, filtered and far away. Blah.",bipolar_disorder

"This might be incoherent. I'm filled with energy and need to rant. I'm doing really well, but I wasn't for the last few months.

Mental health supports in college are a joke. My college prides itself on being inclusive. Really advertises that shit. they have mental health awareness events. The accessibility centre provides temporary counseling for mental health, but if you actually have a disorder that is not GAD and unipolar depression, they won't see you. it says on the website they will but they will keep passing you off saying that they aren't qualified. Which is fair but why is there no one qualified? 

 It's crazy because my profs actively tell us to come to them if we need to talk about mental health and the importance of taking mental health breaks. 
They mean school stress though. And that's hard of course. It's ironic because a lot of them are the same people who say ""oh the weather is so bipolar today"" and call you crazy for being manic.  I am in a health care program and my medical history is in the system. I had to get a prof to look over a section and she fucking recoiled when she read that I had had a mental health hospitalization within the last year and stopped to ask questions. It's in the chart but it was not related to the thing at aLL.

I'm going home for fall break next week and I'm scared to go home. My family is amazing, however seeing my bed and my hang out spots is just going to make me remember stuff.

"I had been putting off submitting my claim for 8 years. It always felt overwhelming. Like, I would begin to gather the documents, fill out forms, and sooner than later the drive to finish was replaced with the worry that someone would some how invalidate my experiences.

I wasn't diagnosed with bipolar until I exited the military. However, the treated me for all sorts of personality and mood disorders ranging from GAD to BPD. I also got into a lot of trouble and battled with psychosis. All of which is well documented.

Once I got out and began working with other physicians and care teams, we put the pieces together. I was going through severe manic-depressive episodes throughout my service. It was honestly a relief to understand the root cause for once.

I started going back on my meds and I noticed that I didn't have anymore daily mood swings. I don't get overwhelmed by my emotions anymore. I don't understand these changes because I had mood swings throughout the day and bipolar s supposed to be on a longer timeline than day to day.

"I had been off my meds a bit, because I couldn't afford them.

I went somewhere to get back on them under supervision.

At this point I had been on lamictal for 17 years, and it worked well for me. I had only been off it 2 days, and was informed at that point they *could* get me back on it without restarting the titration cycle.

But the doctor, who was peppy cheerful in a manner highly reminiscent of the mean girl cheerleader in a movie, took me off it cold turkey instead.

I was on a high dose, and she said that was only for epileptic. She said that medication couldn't be working anymore. 

I was in this place voluntarily, for about a week. And just at the end of that time, I started to have serious issues controlling my anger. Before that I had been calm, quiet, and kept to reading, playing sudoku, or doing puzzles. And was otherwise fairly social.

A day or 2 after the anger kicked in, they told me there was no reason to keep me there any longer.

I was then left in the position where I lost a job in the first hour, couldn't work anywhere, and was helpless to control it.

It was like whenever you're angry, the controls are right in front of you. You can pull levers and press buttons, aka control your actions, calm yourself, and take a step back. But now the controls had completely vanished. I couldn't use them, because they were just- gone.

It took about 6 months to get back up to a functional dose. The time between was absolute hell.

I'm better now, but there are relationships that are absolutely totaled now because of this- and I've been painted as an abuser, despite the fact that this was never my choice. I did everything I could to fix it.

I couldn't be mad at most people who reacted negatively to me. Buy I did judge when it came to people working at mental health facilities. I *knew* I was unpleasant, that's *why* I was trying to get help. But my situation was used to fixate on behaviors I was trying to get help for, and an entire 30 minute onslaught of abuse from a psychiatrist who refused to focus on anything other than me ""not liking the staff."" It was like being back with my mother or auntie-christ, enduring their abuse.

I'm better now. I'm back to functional and in control of myself. But venting because I will never get justice. I tried to get a lawyer, and no one would pick up my case.",bipolar_disorder
"So lately Itâ€™s happening pretty frequently. I have noticed that when I am not full blown hypo manic, I will unintentionally trigger a slightly similar state but it will only last for idk, 5-10 hours. This type of thing hasnâ€™t always been present in my life but I would say the last few months, itâ€™s very common and tbh, when itâ€™s over with I can feel the blood flowing through veins in the layer below my skull and it feels like my brain hates me and I feel kinda numb after. 

It pretty much only happens when I blast my music (Iâ€™ll be pretty neutral before it starts) but itâ€™s like when the music starts, I get a pretty much instant feeling of energy, euphoria, some â€œdelusionalâ€ thinking etc. I have just been doing it a lot lately and yesterday I was in that state for a while and decided to completely rearrange my bedroom and then I wrote in my mood tracker app that I had a feeling that I was going to die in my sleep and that the bedroom was a prefect representation of me so, I wasnâ€™t upset about it.

I told my mom in a note to make sure she waters my African violets because they are family heirlooms and important.

They would tell me I was hard to be around and that I was a bitch. It broke something inside of me.

My anxiety prevents me from socializing or being myself around anyone. So even though I am stable now and it has been 16 years since my symptoms started, Iâ€™m still the teenage girl waiting for her friends to come back and apologize for leaving her - hoping they take back all the awful things they said so I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m complete garbage and worth being someoneâ€™s friend.",bipolar_disorder

"It's like I'm a drug addict but without the drugs

So, near as I can tell, my whole high school and college career was spent in a hypomanic high.  There were a few depressed moments but they never lasted long - I tended towards that enthusiastic appetite for life combined with arrogance and exceptional productivity.  I credit hypomania for the high grades I got in high school and the fact that I graduated college a semester early.

But as y'all know, this couldn't last.  After I graduated from college I went on a 2 month vacation to Peru where I spent my signing bonus on alcohol and coca tea.  By the last week I was moving towards a mixed episode, and I was too depressed to accomplish anything by the time I started working.  And for the past 3 years I've been trying to manage this depression, including some ill advised self medicating.

Now that I'm on mood stabilizers and I'm maxed out on antidepressants that I keep developing a tolerance to, I feel like I've made it to a neutral mood for the first time in over a decade.  And good God it doesn't feel like enough.  My baseline is still that hypomanic high from 4 years ago.  I feel more motivated but not nearly as motivated as I want to be.  I'm not sad, but I'm not happy either.  Doing things I enjoy is fun, but it doesn't give me the same pleasure it used to. 

No wonder so many of us become drug addicts.  Hypomania itself is addictive.  I don't feel like myself without it.

I don't know what this is. I don't know who I am. but I know that I'm tired. exhausted in every way and fed up. what is even the point. I'm no active participant in my life. I just exist. nothing more yet something less in every inconceivable way. until I became indiscernible. I am merely a host that occupied by this disease rotting me from the inside out. I'm no active participant. my decay is exponential and excruciating because I not only feel it happening I see it in the reflection of those around me. which only fills me with guilt. a guilt that is unrelenting suffocating me to my core. bipolar disorder is burying me alive and I do not know how I survive this.,bipolar_disorder

"Partner and I are planning to get a house together. Weâ€™ve known each other 11years. Been together in a committed set up for 2-3. Due to our finances and his self employed status what makes the best sense for us financially is for a house to be bought in my name with me on the mortgage only and him to contribute towards the down payment and rent. We have drawn up a co-habitation agreement to protect him should our relationship break down, but we both want to marry eventually. 

Now he could hold onto the down payment proportion he is contributing until just before we pay. I have not asked he does otherwise but he has deposited 60,000k in my account this week. 

I am not bad with my finances, Iâ€™ve saved 28k since I qualified with my post grad degree in 2018. I have no debt besides student loans which I am paying gradually no issues there. 

My partner has seen me manic, the fact that he is trusting me with alll this money is kind of amazing. When my life felt like it had fallen apart and I would be forever viewed as unrealisable after psychosis didnâ€™t really expect to get here! 

Iâ€™m not worried about spending it, I know I wonâ€™t touch hit except to buy us a house when we find the one we like. 

It does feel like a responsibility though and I have made arrangements to sort out a will ASAP. Not worried about suicide just incase I get really unlucky and die by freak causes...",bipolar_disorder
"So, Iâ€™m really going through it. I went to the dentist today after 5 years.

"Iâ€™ve been Ill since I was 19 years old, had more than 3 major depressions and multiple manic episodes. In mania you feel on the top of the world, but people who love you are worried about you during that period of time. Major depression on the other hand is when you canâ€™t function canâ€™t leave the house, have hard time to shower and long for death. There is also hypomania and mixed episodes. Hypomanic feels the best, youâ€™re creative, happy, social etc. And mixed episodes is when you feel both hypomania and depression at the same time. I love hypomanic state, in which I am right now, but itâ€™s very fragile it can easily develop into mania. Here is my hypomanic wish and desire. I want to change mentality related to mental health. I want to be accepted as manic depressive in society without any judgments. If not me, than future generation should not have these problems.

There's no way I could or would fake a major psychotic break and delusions so severe that I was hospitalized.

I'm hoping someone can give me advice. I have always had the idea in the back of my head that I'm bi polar but always tell myself I'm overreacting and I'm not. For as long as I can remember I have gone back and forth with depressive episodes and then periods were I'm completely fine and happy. Last year around Thanksgiving i started going into a deep depression and it got worse and worse. I decided to get back on celexa for depression in February. I got off of it in 2015.i had about a months worth of side effects and slowly started to feel better. Then I got really happy I decided to get a pixie cut. And i had that pixie cut for a little while. Then I decided to shave my head. And I love it. About 2 months after I shaved my head me and my husband were having problems. I cheated on him online with multiple guys. I dont even know how many. I have never thought about cheating on him or ever thought I would do that until I did. And the whole time I was really happy and wasnt thinking about the consequences. I just kept on until he found out. After he found out i started going into a depression which i have been in for almost 2 months now. I have been feeling crazy. Just going up and down. My depression the other day was so debilitating it still is but I dont feel it as much today. I feel like I'm here but my mind isn't here with me. Could all of that stuff that I have done have been a manic episode. I have read that if your bi polar and you are put on antidepressants it can trigger mania. I have already made a doctors appointment for it. It's on the 10th but I just wanted someone point of view.,bipolar_disorder
"I'm having a lot of trouble keeping up at work.

I feel like I'm drowning and I just look incompetent and lazy, but I'm smart and fast and excellent and I wish they could see it, I'm just struggling right now.

"Today was the last day of classes for the week, Tuesdays and Thursdays are especially difficult for me as I have four classes on those days. Today in my last class I was itching to go home, Iâ€™m surprised I even got to class. We are working on this project with another school and I noticed half way in that u was rambling on about things and not watching what I was saying. That should have bene my first warning signal. I usually keep to myself and donâ€™t do well when Iâ€™m out in situations where I donâ€™t have a desire to interact with people as my response mode is this. At the end of the class the other professor was running very much overtime. It was 7:30pm and I just got up and left. I love 45 min away by bus and very extra second Iâ€™m sitting there Iâ€™m not closer to home. I just got left without even processing my physical actions. That hasnâ€™t happened in a long time. I even called my mom to laugh about it. U til now I didnâ€™t realize I was manic- but three glasses of wine in, I can reflect on what happened. I was on the high. Now my interactions with my group has been fumbled and my professor will look at me differently. I feel such shame- as one does after episodes.

Best practices?,bipolar_disorder
"I have Bipolar 1 and have been on many med combinations since late 2006. I have consistently felt stupid, empty, unmotivated and dulled, just not myself. I always feel better on lower doses, but there is a limit on how low I can go without mania and hospital. For the past year I have been on risperidone, Trileptal, gradually lower doses of clonazepam, and lamotrigine since Jan or Feb.

I was feeling completely mentally blank and numb, so we lowered the risperidone down a few steps, from 3 mg to 2 mg. Now I am feeling somewhat smarter and more able to engage with the world, but I still feel like I am not at 100%, more like 50% (I was at 5% at 3 mg). However I feel like this is the best it's going to get. It wouldn't be wise to lower the risperidone any further. And I don't think the Trileptal is really contributing to the blankness or numbness, I think it's the risperidone.

I feel I just have to settle for having some ability to think but nothing deep, and not being as motivated or interested as other people, or motivated enough to do much at all. Like I can at least follow a conversation, even if I don't have much to say. It's a relief to at least understand what people are saying, now. It's better than having zero verbal comprehension. I can also understand what they're saying on the news, which is a very positive change. But I do wish I had more feelings and initiative, more reactions and interest than I have now. It would be nice to wake up wanting to do something.

I don't feel I have any wiggle room on the medication. I feel like I cannot even bear to be alive when the risperidone is 2.5 mg or higher, and lower than 2 mg would just put me at higher risk for mania, another hospitalization, and probably a higher, more soul-sucking dose of something and needing to die because of being such a zombie. I have already been on lithium, valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and most of the atypical antipsychotics. Never found a combo that worked to prevent mania without the severe brain fog (and even with the fog many meds have failed). Have spent many years just sitting around doing nothing, or going through the motions in what few jobs or volunteer opportunities I have been involved in. Brain at 50% is a relatively good number for me.

I feel like this is quite possibly the very best it gets for me. I know people talk about trying meds until you feel normal and good and functional and all that, but I am not sure that is possible in my case. You eventually run out of options and have to settle.

Have others had the same experience? Just kind of limping by, impaired by mania-prevention meds but not wanting to get manic? Not able to adjust meds downwards anymore? Not really being a deep or real person, but having to just live with it? Stuck that way for lack of reasonable alternatives? Or afraid to try anything else for fear of the brain fog / numbness / amotivation being even worse - or failing to prevent mania and landing you in hospital?

How do you cope with being half alive? Surely it's better than being completely dead / 100% zombified, but it's still not a great state. It still doesn't afford much inner movement. It doesn't make therapy that possible, for example. (You need emotions and thoughts for therapy.) It doesn't make you an active participant in life.

I don't know whether it's worth adding something ""for depression"" or not, when it seems like the meds for mania are the problem. Lamotrigine was supposed to be ""for depression"", but we've had to limit the dose to 100 mg because it was making me foggy (or we thought so - this was before risperidone was lowered). So it seems like I am stuck here, in this limbo state, not really living.",bipolar_disorder

"i have great friends who know about me having bipolar disorder. they are understanding of it. but I still feel isolated, because sometimes I just want to talk about something like my medications or my episodes. i try not to go too in depth because I understand they donâ€™t know what to say sometimes because they canâ€™t relate. But sometimes my friends just ignore what I say and stop replying (through text usually). 
For example, today my friend and I were texting quite a bit consistently back and forth but as soon as I bring up one of the side effects of my medication (disassociating a lot), she stopped replying. And sometimes she doesnâ€™t reply for days and then she will randomly text me starting a whole new conversation.

"About 5 years ago I met the love of my life. He's a musician, very creative and a bit of a vagabond. And of course like most artists very sensitive to mental health problems.
About 3 years ago he got sick, chronic sinitis and cluster headache. After an operation for the sinitis and meds for the cluster headache (and micro dosing) he got quite stable for a year or two. 

But in january his father suddenly died and he got into a deep depression. After some therapy he got some citalopram to make it a bit easier. It worked like a charm but the cluster attacks suddenly got back. They havent gone away yet, since May. Its worse than ever before. 
Because of my bipolar I know a lot about medication, serotonin etc. I always said it couldnt be coincidence but the gp said it could nog be the citalopram. 
About 2 weeks ago I was awake after he had a bad cluster attack and started my google quest again. I found in several scientific sources that higher levels of serotonin can trigger clusters. So my partner went to the gp and now he's weaning off it to test the hypothesis. 

But now I live with a guy with a condition also called suicide headaches, and getting off citalopram. It's so terribly hard, he tries to put it in perspective but I know how hard that is. And it will take so long, probably a month before he's off citalopram and maybe longer if he will go on another antidepressant.

I held my head up for a long time. I still worked and love my job. But last week I totally crashed and feel depressed like hell, with some weird elevated spikes. The clusterattacks are so horrible, he's in such agony. They also happen during the night, so its hard to sleep. I hate this so much, it feels so endless.

He was always my rock when I had an episode and I was his the other way around. But now we try to be there for each other but it's hard not to pull each other down. We really try, we make sure we eat healthy food, take a walk every day. Sometimes we have a nice moment. But its so hard. I really need my man when I feel like this but he's so empty inside. 

On the other side it's valuable that we both know how it feels. We have some different needs of course but the understanding helps. We try to spend some time apart from each other now, to regain the balance a bit. 

So I feel crappy and hopeless :( but nice to have a good rant",bipolar_disorder

"Has anyone, especially in the US, ever been to a facility that is more holistic rather than a sterile, prison-esque psych ward?

Iâ€™m not sure if those exists, but my two experiences with two different psych wards have been awful - little to no outdoors time, no division of men/women (I become especially uncomfortable with men during my episodes), getting paired with highly unstable and sometimes violent roommates. As my two stays have been the result of mania, I have been, by default I imagine, placed in some of the more extreme units - lots of yelling/fighting, extra activities constantly being taken away, etc. I felt like I got worse each stay and had to mentally fight to get out. I donâ€™t believe these are places that are very conducive to healing.

Anyway, when I search for something more holistic to keep in mind for my future emergency plan, what I mostly find are drug rehab facilities that cater to dual diagnosis (addiction + mental health). I am lucky to have no addiction issues, even when severely manic, so I donâ€™t think those places would work for me. There were a few that seemed to be only for mental health, but the program lengths were 6 week or more, which is much longer than what I have needed in the past to stabilize (1-2 weeks). Honestly, I donâ€™t understand why similar facilities donâ€™t exist for mental health patients - places that actually promote healing and self care.",bipolar_disorder

"I called my psychiatrist yesterday about some ""shadow critters,"" as my mom calls them, that I had been visually hallucinating. She told me to stop my abilify cold turkey starting tomorrow.

For perspective, I used to be on 30mg. I was tapering down as directed starting Friday from 30mg to 15mg. I was supposed to start breaking the 15mg in half to 7.5mg and then stopping. But now we're just stopping it altogether I guess. ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ (I have Risperdal and vraylar as well, so no worries as far as antipsychotics go.) I'm just concerned stopping this medication abruptly could cause unwanted, adverse effects. My mom has the same anxieties as I do about it, which isn't easing my concerns any. 

Then, my psychiatrist told me I couldn't work today or tomorrow. Which totally blows. I want to work. I want to be a productive member of society. I miss my clients. But shadow people/critters = no work apparently. I'm totally bummed. I had a conversation with my mom in the car earlier. I said, ""I'm upset that I can't have it both ways."" She said, ""What do you mean?"" I said, ""I can't be mentally stable and work at the same time, apparently."" ðŸ™„

He's on guanfacine, Adderall, and Clonidine. He's diagnosed so far with ADHD and DMDD. We are waiting on a punch eval but our insurance isn't take by most places. This morning he woke us up to tell us something was on his head and it kept repeating ""Patty cake Patty cake."" That ""Squiggles"" wanted him to play but he told it no, not right now, maybe later. He said Squiggles lives in his sister curtain and has no eyes or stomach. That Squiggles has babies that play ""peek a boo"" in the curtains and that Squiggles other family live far away and are upset that Squiggles is trying to hurt my son's brain. He says Squiggles sits on his head till he leaves the room then he jumps off and sits above his sister bed. Squiggles come out at night time and goes back to the curtain when the sun comes up. He said squiggles wants to hurt him, to give him anxiety and sits in front of him so he can't see anything but Squiggles. 

My son has been having full blown conversation with himself, doing the voices of both sides of the conversation, not normal kid playing behavior, his therapist has seen him on video in his room doing it and was very concerned.

For example, I am a freelance artist. Iâ€™m very good at what I do and when I work hard and put my mind to it, I make good money doing what I love. I have great credits that people dream of having which should push me to keep going bigger and better but one day Iâ€™ll wake up and have no motivation. I feel terrible about my craft and canâ€™t believe that anyone thinks Iâ€™m talented.

"Long story short, my mother has struggled with mental health for the past 30 years. Her diagnosis is Bipolar 2, Hypo -manic. Iâ€™ve seen her in my childhood in both manic and severely depressive states. At the time I wasnâ€™t old enough to know much and we didnâ€™t talk well as a family, but I just knew my mom was â€œhigh or â€œsickâ€.

The last 10 years my mom has been great! Sheâ€™s outgoing, spontaneous, but balanced! Sheâ€™s always been a spender, but Iâ€™ve never been worried about her. Iâ€™m very proud of her for this. 

Flash forward to this spring and myself, my partner, and my mothers closest friends and family all started seeing a change of her getting heightened. Exhibiting all the various symptoms of Mania - agitated, defensive, hyper, not sleeping well, increased spending and poor financial decisions, risky behaviour, etc. They talked to her, she said she was trying, and eventually I had probably the first very serious and emotional conversation with her about my worries. She told me she had a doctors appointment coming up and was working on it. It ended well, but she was good at spinning, deflecting and warping the truth to take very little accountability or admit she needs help - other than an acknowledgement she was â€œHighâ€. Bottom line, I was worried about damage to her reputation (already starting), financial damage (trying to buy a lake property a single woman wanting to retire in 2 years should not buy), or that without help she will hit a significant depression when she stops taking care of her self. 

At the doctors appointment last week, her doctor commited her to the psych. Ward based on what he saw. Sheâ€™s been there involuntarily now for 6 days. She has no insight why sheâ€™s there, is very agitated and defensive. Blames everyone else. When I bring up me wanting her to stay or that I think she needs it, she ignores, deflects or gets agitated. Itâ€™s very unlike her. She is getting new meds - a long term anti-psychotic injection 4 days ago ( flupentixol) as well as 600mg of lithium daily, which she says she hasnâ€™t taken in 10 years. On top of sleeping medication. 

She has an appeal tomorrow, and long story shorter, will likely get out according to the social worker. There may be a requirement that a Nurse checks in Daily for some time to confirm compliance with medication. 

How do I navigate this? Sheâ€™s an adult and I have to let her make her own decisions I know, but the last week alone has been hard and feels like only the beginning. Iâ€™m worried she will make bad decisions, get herself hurt(not intentionally) and/or fall into a deep depressive state.

I never know how much to engage in arguments while still being compassionate. When I raise my points, she usually doesnâ€™t hear them anyways, so it feels like rational conversation never happens. I am never accusatory or harsh, I try to be delicate but eventually firm when needed. 

The social work team says Iâ€™m doing well in the support; but just need a little more help if you can offer on how to deal with this. Thanks so much!",bipolar_disorder

"Need some advice here...I have consciously made a horrible decision, for very selfish reasons. 

I've been exposed to covid through a family member but chose to see a romantic partner instead of isolating for the full 5 days. Now, I know he has three kids and is also a teacher and coach. The potential flow on impact of him contracting covid is huge. HUGE. 

I've justified doing this by telling myself: I've tested negative so far and have no symptoms, it's been 4 days since last direct exposure to the positive person (ok, more like 3.25) and we're both triple vax'd.

The reason why I chose to do this: sex. We only see each other every 2-3 weeks and I didn't want to wait that long.

I obsessed about this decision leading up to it, and kept finding myself dismissing any worry about him getting covid. I knew it was a bad decision, but didn't 'feel' the full impact of making it at the time. I felt no guilt. 

I did, however, tell him about the potential exposure so he could make his own decision. 

So yes, last night we met up and had a lovely evening. This morning he texted that he'd been vomiting all morning. Now, I know symptoms almost never show up until 2 days after exposure and vomiting isn't usually one of the first signs. But I am MORTIFIED I've given it to him.

And the other scary thing is, I'm not just worried about him or any of his close contacts getting it...it's that this will impact how he sees me.

No gratefulness for their own mental health....just a need to crucify her for what she did. I think we HAVE to be responsible for what we do, but ... the heartlessness of some of these comments...it's disturbing.!&lt;

&gt;!One headline said ""her tumultuous life""...well, okay, but it wasn't only...she had so many accomplishments both personal and professional. Moments of service to others. And that's how they sum up her life in a headline?!&lt;

"Hi, autist here.

It is pretty late where I currently am, but I wanted to make this post before going to bed to hopefully read some interesting replies tomorrow:

I think that many, especially more common psychologic disorders, are actually some evolutionary ""tweaks"" (that come with a cost) that originally evolved to vary individuals in a stone age (or before) human group to make the group as a whole stronger. Similar to specific types of ants in an ant hill (for instance soldiers and workers, but also some more weird specializations exist like an ant with a very large, deformed and hard head whose job it is to ""block"" entrances to the hill with its head when a predator arrives) I would suspect that also humans have evolved to have different specific treats to fulfill different roles within a stone age society, albeit to a lesser degree. Obviously, many of these kinds of mutations can come with huge drawbacks (take the ant with its bulky head for example, it is a pain for it to even just move around, but at the same time it fulfills an important role in the ant society). 

In humans, People with ADHD for instance are considered by some to be the former ""hunters"". Their observant nature (but observant to everything, hence getting easily distracted in the modern world) may have helped them with not getting eaten themselves by predators whilst hunting. Also, they can hyperfocus on some things for long times, in the stone age example this would be detected prey. 

I personally think it is similar with autism. In the stone age autists would probably be the tool makers. We have all kinds of problems with social interaction, but we can without issues work alone for hours on something that interests us, and if we are focused on something we will try to learn absolutely everything about it. So, who probably makes better hunting spears than the weirdo that does not talk about anything else than spears and spends all his time making tons of spears? 

Since bipolar disorders and related conditions are also rather common, I was thinking that this may also have had an important benefit within stone age society.  Something that outweighed the disadvantages so that a group, including one or a few bipolar individuals, had a better chance to survive than a group without such individuals. My question to you, the experts, would be what do you think are traits that come with the bipolar disorder that would have been of use in such an old tribal society (or also maybe still of use now)? Sorry if I am annoying, I am just interested in the topic and I think this also may give you a new, interesting perspective on this condition.",bipolar_disorder
"Idk if this is a bipolar thing because i've had it my entire life- so before my bipolar symtoms began. Also don't know if this is completely normal and it's wtvr- just wanted to see if someone can relate.  
So, i'm a person with alot of empathy, i care about people deeply and i'm always there for anyone who needs help. But i've also noticed that i sometimes have very little empathy- like the second someone annoys me or simply says something i find to be off- i lose all empathy, instantly. I get it very randomly, like someone can in my eyes seem like a great friend, n then they say something that doesn't sit right with me- and suddenly i just don't care about them or their feelings. Like there's been too many times where someone who had feelings for me- somehow annoyed me, and i just lost all empathy and end up treating them like shit which then obvs kinda ""breaks their heart"" as some have stated. But i just can't find it in me, at those moments, to care. Even with my partner at times, like recently we had a simple discussion, he said something that sounded like he accused me of smth- and for awhile i just lost all empathy- i was about to go off, i didn't care if i was gonna lose the relationship over something so small. But after awhile we talked thru it and everything was back to normal.  


But yeah- idk what it is, but sometimes my lack of care for others feelings kinda scares me. I think im a rather nice person-- but how can i be if i play with peoples feelings or treat them badly?",bipolar_disorder
"I know I already have ptsd. But last year  I went through this period where I didnâ€™t eat for three days, sometimes didnâ€™t sleep for two days at a time, I didnâ€™t feel tired at all.

"Sure, Facebook could easily ignite all sorts of anxiety into people, but ""mind-reading"" is already a negative symptom in Bipolar Disorder and Social media just makes that infinitely worse.

Now, with reddit it's the general public...I care about it like I care about the person on the street. Which is to say, I genuinely hope they're okay...no one wants to be bullied or ridiculed...people like to help out if they can (usually)...etc.

But having someone snicker at the t-shirt I wear at Walmart is not going to devastate me. If I say ""hi"" and they ignore me, my day will go along just fine (although I will probably suspect that I need to project my voice more or that they are evil people who must be dealt with when I am emperor).

But with Facebook, you say ""hi"" in a direct message and they say nothing back.

Well....they read it...it says so right there with the little symbol thingie...so what does that mean? Did you say something wrong? Did you say ""Good evening"" when you meant ""Good morning""? Were they too busy? That happens sometimes...you mean to write something back but ""Hi"" seems too lame so you try to think of something and just then you get a phone call, there's a delivery at the door and you just remembered, you are baking a pizza which is probably burning now so you will need to go out to get something to eat or everyone will be late for dinner and you can't be off schedule because tomorrow you have a work meeting and the big boss is going to be there and you're pretty sure he doesn't like you anyway, which it's hard to say because he looks like he never smiles and if he never smiles does he even have friends but I suppose it's easy to not care if you have friends if you have that amount of money and no soul because did you see the guys car....overcompensating for something....what were doing....oh...right...pizza....

BUT...it might be total rejection. 

Wait.

How could it be rejection?

What did you do? Extended a friendly hello? That's it? That's the last straw with this person? After all you did? Who the heck do they think they are? Who was there for them when no one else was? And they posted that thing about their ""Bestest most loyal friend"" and they choose Jodi?? Not that it matters, Amy isn't really your bestie either, but it's the hypocrisy of the thing, after all, who is Jodi? Jodi wasn't writing them when they were lonely abroad! Jodi didn't calm them down when they were nervous about getting married! And who drove for 2 hours to pick Amy up when Amy (You know how Amy does, of course Barry can never seem to schedule car maintenance to save his life either and let's face it, he is MADE of money...and it's not like he spends it responsibly) ignored the ""Check Engine"" light on her car one too many times and ended up stranded in Cole County....no one deserves to be stranded in Cole County...certainly not one of YOUR friends, and now they just posted something else, proving they not only ARE online but have time to write stuff!!!

It IS total rejection!!!!! 

Why, when you think of all the time you've spent on them when, let's face it, your old high school buddy Jason was always an infinitely more chill dude to hang out with than either of them and you got none of this drama...

"I had been taking 300 mg extended  release twice a day for about 15 days, maybe closer to 20. I was feeling  fine, kinda just happy for the first time in a while. I did have pretty  severe side effects (intense thirst/dehydration, excessive peeing,  slight kidney pain). I decided that the side effects were probably worth  it in exchange for being alright mentally.

However,  at one point I became almost manic and super shaky. I do not usually  become manic, I usually stay somewhere on the hypomanic side of things  (the only time I have truly become manic before was when I was on  lexapro). This was unusual, especially because I'm on two mood  stabilizers (lithium and lamictal). I also was having fairly intense  feelings of bugs crawling on me and was sure that they were in my hair. I  saw them out of paranoia a couple times too. It was bad enough that I  bought lice shampoo to try and feel better.

I  emailed my psych on Friday, and was told to stop taking lithium until  Monday, when our next appt is. I have done so, and the mania / shakiness  has stopped. I feel right back at my baseline (depressed) but also in  less physical discomfort from the side effects.

About a year ago, I began noticing some changes in my behavior, no manic phases but aggressive and depressive phases. In these phases the smallest things could set me off- hitting/scratching myself just so I don't lose my mind and alert my parents. I could spend a few days- weeks in depressive phases. 

I cover really well, I do my best not to blow up infront of others. As far as my parents(dad and step mother) know, I'm still their happy, healthy little girl. 

I lost 35 lbs in the span of 8 months due to anorexia and bulimia. Starving, cutting, and vomiting. Once again, I'm good at covering so my parents have no idea. I'm convinced that I went through an 8 month depressive episode, which is why I haven't noticed any more symptoms of bipolar disorder till now. 

I'm healthy, and happy, and I have friends and a boyfriend, but the last few days have been rough.

"This has come up for me a lot. How do you perceive and handle when someone drops bipolar as derogatory? For me (35F)  Itâ€™s usually men describing their exâ€™s or women in general. I havenâ€™t actually had a woman describe someone as bipolar as a result of their conflict, their feelings and reactivity.
I understand this comes from a complete lack of understanding of, and sensitivity to, the reality and struggles people with legit bipolar struggle with. People think someoneâ€™s bipolar because theyâ€™re easily triggered. In a relationship context, itâ€™s disowning their role in driving said woman crazy (I doubt the lady is bipolar). Sheâ€™s been dismissed as simply bipolar as an explain all for issues and feelings.  So for me itâ€™s an ignorance and insensitivity issue.

"I want to know if any of you have had vision problems because of bipolar medicines. Haven't gotten consistent answers from doctors.

I have bipolar 2 and am currently taking 300mg lamotrigine and 300 bupropion (wellbutrin). Earlier I was also on abilify but I stopped a year ago. About a year and a half ago I suddenly started seeing double. Not a lot, like an offsetted shadow of edges on top. It is most prominent in low light and when there is something light on a black background (like subtitles) or the moon. It is usually not a problem, but walking or driving at night is dangerous. I have seen 4 ophthalmologists and 3 optometrists have had all sorts of tests done, but no one has been able to tell why this is happening. I got a pair of specs that reduced the shadow, but it is still not completely gone.

My brother is also a doctor, so he looked up side effects of the medications (I know I can google it on my own, but he can better assess legitimacy of claims). It is possible to have visual disturbances because of bipolar medication. Lamotrigine seems to be the one which causes double vision, it didn't say this specifically for bupripion and abilify. But I have been having 300mg lamotrigine consistently for 10 years and this hasn't happened before. 

If any of you have experienced this before, has a medical professional said that it is because of medication? How have you been able to rectify it?",bipolar_disorder

"I had a tiny episode yesterday while at work. Tiny for me, big enough that Iâ€™m now worried for my job and my relationship. 

To start, I had an event trigger me just before I went in for work. I got yelled at for 10 minutes for trying to park my car on the street in public parking. This set me in a bad frame of mind as I went into work, and got into a tiff while I was entering the building with security. Things escalated very quickly from there that I know at the very least an incident report was made, and itâ€™s likely I have a â€œstrikeâ€ against me.

In the aftermath, I immediately felt bad, and wished I couldâ€™ve made different choices, but when my mania took over, it was like I was on the outside watching my body make these bad choices. At this point, Iâ€™m trying to mitigate fallout from the event, but like I said, Iâ€™m afraid for job security. 

In terms of my SO, we work together so he was witness and privy to the whole event, and though he knew Iâ€™m bipolar, I donâ€™t think heâ€™d ever seen an episode before. Of course we talked about it after work last night, and he told me how he felt about it all, and today it feels like he really doesnâ€™t want anything to do with me at all.

"Interestingly, whether I am hypomanic or depressive I want to drop all my responsibilities.

Depressive:

I feel exhausted and apathetic. I want to withdraw into myself and hibernate for months or years. Energy feels like a fairy tale and I canâ€™t believe it was once something I experienced not too long ago.

Hypomanic:

I want to chase my compulsions. They entice me that at the end of the pursuit I will feel something Iâ€™ve never felt namely â€˜satisfied with myself.â€™ 

I am a programmer and I may have thoughts about how to code the most elegant software architectures ever witnessed by man or machine. I write creatively as a hobby and I will obsessively write 80,000 words of an epic story that burns in my mind as though gifted to me by the muses of Ancient Greece. 

I am non binary AFAB and I will form a graduate level thesis on how societyâ€™s importance on gender roles have oppressed woman into neurotic behavior and then blamed them for behaving neurotically. Society dictates that women cannot complain so they mask and claim they are fine. Their true feelings are only allowed to be expressed with subtle signals that only other oppressed people will recognize. On the other hand, a man will be taught that getting angry is fine when they are displeased. So they find an oppressed womanâ€™s conditioned responses incomprehensible. They may even jokingly say, â€œa woman saying she is fine means all hell will break loose.â€ Society never dictated that they have to repress their dislikes to behave in a ladylike manner, so it seems absurd to them. We are demons that blame each other rather than taking accountability. I have never studied gender issues, but I am feeling grandiose so I am certain these are the issues I faced when I was being raised female. 

I feel compelled to write these thoughts out and drag over them again and again despite all the mundane tasks I need to accomplish going unfinished and unstarted.

"So background: one of my hobbies is keeping houseplants, and I also work in horticulture. Over the past couple of years I've gotten to know this small group of women through local plant swaps and such and we bonded through a shared hobby, traded plants with each other, etc. And we've all been there for each other through some really tough shit in our personal lives.

And I never really had stable friendships growing up. When I was younger and unmedicated, I was not pleasant to be around looking back. I'm 26 now and this is the first time I've felt like I've had a solid friend group in my whole life.

Last night they came over to trade some plant cuttings. We sat on my living room floor eating pizza and chips, laughing and talking, admiring each other's plants.

My wife and I are worried about her sister, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder earlier this year after suffering a psychotic episode, likely induced by new medication in combination with personal trauma that she experienced at the time. 

She was hospitalized against her will after intentionally crashing her car (according to her own admission) and put on antipsychotic medication for the duration of her hospitalization. 

After her stay at the hospital, her behavior normalized and she seemed motivated to tackle her mental health head on. Sadly, apart from regular communication with her med-manager, sheâ€™s mostly refused to deal with this incident at all. She does not allow it to be brought up in conversation at all and insists that she has been lucid and coherent the entire time. According to hospital documents and her families personal experience of the day, that is objectively not true. 

Since her mood seemed stable this last half year, her family tried to give her space and process at her own pace. 

A month ago she moved to a different state and immediately started showing signs of severe depression (staying in bed for days, not showering, not taking care of getting the empty apartment furnished,â€¦). Her family tried to support her as best as they could by sending housewarming gifts, visiting, calling and checking in. She has been dealing with depression and the resulting procrastination her entire adult life. 

A week ago she started broadcasting on all channels (endless text messages, half hour voice notes and videos to every family member) how happy she was that she was feeling better. It has been an endless barrage of epiphanies since then: coming out as non-binary, deciding to legally change her name to her momâ€™s maiden name, finding faith and breaking down crying during her rabbiâ€™s sermon (probably not the right term, sorry!), the list goes on. Her family was trying to be excited for her but also deeply concerned since she was showing all these signs of being in a very agitated state that were extremely reminiscent of the week leading up to her psychotic episode. 

Since then, her mood has swung to being at war with every individual family member for varying reasons. Sheâ€™s refusing to take the emergency antipsychotics she has on her and ignoring all of the tools for emotional self-regulation my wife and her have worked out together as soon as they hang up the phone. 

Her registration for Medicaid in the new state is still being processed and she is currently uninsured. She is coherent and calm enough where emergency hospitalization is not an option at this point, but then she swings towards extreme dysregulation. We are all deeply worried and donâ€™t know how to proceed. 

Iâ€™m hoping that you might share some insights, resources, tips, or whatever to help us help her.",bipolar_disorder

"Hey, I'll try to be short as possible.

I'm autistic, high functioning like they say nowadays. In the few last months I started texting than calling then I saw one a girl, she started everything, and she was so much into me that felt sometimes fake but she was so charming and beautiful and unique. We were talking in any way like every moment of the week.

So we met, we felt so good, only talked, we live in two different countries, then after a week or two since almost 3 weeks she almost ghosted me. She keep me sending meme, jokes, and love hearts on insta. Nothing else.

I then remember that she said her terapist disgnosed her with BP disorder. But she doesn't feel so.

At my last message after a month almost of support and taking my side keeping suffering I just texted that this is strange also as friends and we were talking love for almost two months... She replied almost immediately (recently she replied after days sometimes) that quote:

***I'm so sorry--I never know how to deal with people.
My way of letting others know that I care is a sending of this crap to laugh together....
And then I'm heading into the darkness, feeling depressed and apathetic. I have incredible mood swings***

She didn't get my message... at all... That last part can suggest that she's really falling into some disorder. I'm not a specialist, I'm only trying to think what is better to do... I know I can't do much if it's something like that but anyone has something to say?

"I (18 f) got diagnosed with bipolar at the beginning of this year. I was dealing with a lot of different stuff and doing lots of drugs. Around June I went off my meds (I was on latuda) and I don't really know why. I felt a lot of shame for going on meds especially with the shit I got from my parents for it. My memory is terrible, I feel like I'm just floating through the days I don't have the energy to anything. I'm failing my college classes and lying to everyone about it.

I know that's probably the depression bit but I don't even feel depressed most of the time I don't feel anything so who am I to say I'm feeling depressed? Who am I to go back to the doctor and start the process all over again when I'm probably just going to go off of them again. I feel terribly ungrateful and guilty, I feel like I'm taking resources away from people who really need it. 

I just don't know what to do. half of the time I'm convincing myself I'm not mentally ill and I'm actually just doing it for attention. even if I were to go back to the doctor I don't even think I would be able to give an accurate representation of my symptoms, I feel like I always over exaggerate them and that's how I got diagnosed in the first place. 

anyways I think half of this post is just me trying to convince myself I am actually mentally ill. I wany to talk to my bf about it but he has his own stuff and I don't want to bother him with my self pity party so I'm just bothering you guys about it lol.",bipolar_disorder

Like of course sleeping 24/7 makes me unhappy! Itâ€™s very irritatingâ€¦ how am I supposed to feel better if I am struggling in all my classes? Do all medications do this?? Am I supposed to just adjust to being sleepy 24/7? Caffeine does nothing",bipolar_disorder
"I remember seeing some article once about a woman who had lost her home several times due to hurricanes, having to start over and rebuild each time. And I think it's a bit relatable to how I have experienced bipolar.

In the first many years in ignorance of what was going on, over a decade, I succumbed to depression that got worse and worse as the years went, until I couldn't take it anymore. But because I was barely functioning at that time, it was ineffective and and ended up surviving and hospitalized for months. And a lot of resources were put in by society to try and rehabilitate me, rebuilding me. 

Slowly, I started getting better and slightly hopeful about life. Working on myself and one day after a long time,  I found myself happy. ""This is how life should be, I did it! For the first time in my life I am happy!"" I thought. I had won and figured out life! I had a relationship, a good job. I could finally begin living.

Except, it didn't stop at happily ever after. I got increasingly ""happier"" and suddenly I had these grandiose plans on how to save the world, writing a book for that purpose, going to dangerous areas. If everyone knew what I knew and felt, with my love and happiness, there would be no more problems. Euphoria.

At a regular appointment, a psychiatrist could tell, without me even mentioning these plans. ""You are manic"". Pleading or discussing it didn't help. I was committed against my will. At the hospital, the diagnosis came, Bipolar. I had gone through all that just to be deemed insane, locked away.

I was back to rebuilding, not just my mental state but the perception of myself and everything. The home within.
And it's been like that ever since, just building that home back up again in order for it to be blown down by some invisible hurricane. And I will keep doing that , through the depression, suicidal thoughts, the other episodes. It's just that, it's not getting easier and I am tired. How long can one do this?

If you struggle with something similar, I have no answers. Only that I will cling to hope as long as I can, that we can have that inner peaceful home, that at least lasts for a little while longer.",bipolar_disorder
"I am not diagnosed with anything, tho me and my a select few family members have been trying to get my grandma to see someone for years because we believe sheâ€™s bipolar. I donâ€™t know much about it thoughâ€¦.. I come from a family where mental health is not very considered. Idk if thatâ€™s related but yeah.

Here we go. So, my ex broke up with me last week (in a pretty traumatic way, might I add). 
I was only sad for a dayâ€¦. And then all of a sudden I felt like a switch flip in my head.

I ended up writing my ex a note asking if he wanted to be fwb (only 3 days after break upâ€¦..)

I have only been eating every other day. Im buying hundreds of dollars of worthless shit (like 1000$ this weekâ€¦ im a broke college student)

I feel like my body is vibrating. All of my energy is making me nauseous. Im getting less sleep.

Its been about a week now.

Oh, and i have filled up a whole sketchbook with letters/poems in just the last couple of days.

So for years i have had terrible nightmares every night. But now, ever since the break up, ive just been having really trippy and somewhat pleasant dreams.

I laugh at stupid dumb shit.

Any time i have to text my ex about picking up his stuff and whatnot, i actually HAVE FUN. I flirt, i tease, i make jokes. Its like i have no pain or awareness of the terrible break up i just went through. 

I just scheduled an appointment to get 2 tattoos (ive never been tattood).

The only person i spend time with is my sister who i live with. She seems a bit concerned but i think she just thinks im happy to be single.

This week has felt like a lifetime.

Ive gotten drunk more times this week than i have all year. I dont normally like drinking. But drinking this week has been the only thing to slow my mind down.

I know that this sort of sounds like mania based off what ive seen on google, but could it just be my reaction to a break up? Also, if i was manic, would i even realize it?",bipolar_disorder

"I have been in one of those ""push everyone away"" phases, and while I don't want a divorce, things have been quite toxic and whenever literally anything comes up where I get remotely upset I'm instantly told I should get med adjustments to even me out more or bring it up to my therapist. Apparently being bipolar is a terminal sentence in which all of a relationships issues can be blamed.

I know this is fucking stupid, but whenever I think about how our 4 cats would be split, I get really upset and depressed. 2 of them have been raised together for 10 years, and the other two are sisters from the same litter. I can't get over how much it bothers me to have that thought, I don't want to split them up, and I don't want to lose my beloved pets.

"I initially picked it up with wet hands and threw it away, when the Nurse Practitioner said ""It wasn't me, but very funny though"" then no one acknowledged it. Not going to lie I have had auditory hallucinations so I question a lot of my daily life. So I went back to the trash and dug it out to make sure that really happened. Because today an alarm went off and I used to hear those in my car when I was driving a lot. I no longer drive due to a different medical condition so I ride with my husband and no longer have those. So I don't know if it was my car or what, but I had to ask a patient if they heard it too. So I mean it's not out of the realm of possibility for me, I guess. I don't feel as though it is necessarily meant  for me, but it was still traumatic. I spent the rest of the shift in the bathroom.

"I'm 19f, during my last manic episode I got pregnant with my 2nd child during then got married to the father. That was the most severe manic episode I've ever gone through.

That part isn't what's ruining my life necessarily, it's the fact that I can't ever feel good about my decisions. I always feel like I've messed up no matter how hard I try. Even if my moods are controlled and I'm not manic or depressed I question if I'm doing the right thing all the time. I feel like a failure as a mother and person. 

I had a baby at 17 and was homeless at the time, I had a full blown manic episode and met the man I'm with today. I got pregnant by him when my son was only 4 months old. I completely lost touch with reality and pushed everyone in my life away. My parents have nothing to do with me. I have mental illness on both sides of my family, especially my dad's family. I don't want to be a continuation of my family's curse. I have been on meds and nothing helped. I got off of meds awhile ago because it wasn't helping anyway.
I ended up in the hospital during my manic episode, they said I have bipolar type 1 and psychosis, I left early by self discharge. I feel like that was a death sentence, no one will ever take me seriously because people with mental illness are treated differently.

"How do you deal with irritability? 

I (30F) recently had a burnout, which I relate to exhaustion rather than depression. I was off work for a few weeks and am now slowly getting back into it. I am still dealing with trying to recover although I am feeling positive about how I handled the situation after talking to my psychiatrist. It feels like I am entering a new phase now though. Even though I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in 2019, it feels like I am only starting to accept it now. Unlike my recent autism diagnosis, I never felt like the bipolar diagnosis really fits. I am starting to think this might be because it came a little unexpected and I didn't come to it by myself in my own time (like with autism), even though deep down I think I've known I am bipolar since my first big hypomanic episode 10 years ago.
With all this, I am currently feeling uncertain that I actually know what is real. 
I feel stable at the moment but am experiencing a lot of irritability. I just can't deal with people at the moment because everything just annoys me. I have been feeling this irritability since August/September already (even throughout the burnout, I just didn't have the energy to do anything about it). Now my energy levels are coming back up and I am just so annoyed about everything. I think it is making me a not so nice person because I don't have much patience for anyone else or what their issues are right now. I am going hiking on my own for a long weekend just to hopefully help get back to myself.

when i think of myself, i feel like iâ€™m floating within a vessel- not necessarily physically, but mostly mentally. 

iâ€™m bipolar type 1 with ptsd, anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and more. the result is that every emotion is way more intense and heightened. it feels like i am only my emotions because of how much i feel them. 

who i am feels like a constantly changing thing because i feel trapped within infinite layer of emotion, anxiety, depression, and so much more. 

who am i under those layers?? how do i define that?? 

whenever i try to think about this, i think about my younger self. it felt like i was the most true when i was a child, before the onset of trauma and mental illness. i feel like deep down, im still a child. 

maybe this is who i am, but i feel like i deserve to credit myself for the growth iâ€™ve made. iâ€™ve improved so much as a person and iâ€™ve worked so hard to get where i am. the thing that conflicts me is that i really only needed to improve because of my mental illness and the habits i adapted from abuse. this is what i meant by â€œlayersâ€ - did i grow if i was only responding to things that i had no control over? who was growing?

No judgment but I love Taylor swift, I did get tickets, after a nerve wracking 6 hours. Barely. My whole family depended on me. I donâ€™t work, so obviously I have the free time.

We ended up with not very good seats and some people are upset, but I couldnâ€™t have done anything differently to be in earlier. I started drinking to deal with the stress.

I thought we werenâ€™t going to get anything, shows weâ€™re selling out, I still feel like I did a bad job. My partner comforted me until he had to go to bed for work. He doesnâ€™t understand how I am still stressed, because ultimately it did work out even if it wasnâ€™t as planned, and no one other than my teenaged sister is mad.

Iâ€™m relieved how it turned out to be honest, but the stress of the day has broken me. Iâ€™m here and still canâ€™t sleep. I just feel so wired and exhausted and stressed all at the same time. I need to sleep tonight, itâ€™s been days since I last slept well, a few more days of not sleeping Iâ€™ll start seeing things from psychosis, and honestly that thought is probably psyching me out from sleeping.

But when we get into arguments, they are heated beyond belief. He misinterprets what I say, often, and gets very defensive. He never lets me finish a sentence and immediately jumps to conclusions. He thinks Iâ€™m gaslighting him and Iâ€™m putting words in his mouth. This is not the case whatsoever. But whenever I decide to share and communicate a concern of mine, this is how he reacts. 

Itâ€™s frightening, to an extent, because I want to be with this man for the rest of my life. I want him as the father of my children. But if me bringing up a small concern always has to turn into him freaking out, I donâ€™t think I can do it. I need stability. Itâ€™s not fair that I work and try to be as understanding as possible and suppress my issues, but he canâ€™t do the same. And Iâ€™m sure people will respond by saying that his disorder is significantly more severe than mine, which I get. But I donâ€™t know. Advice? Once he steps away for a few minutes from the discussion, he apologizes and says he loves me and wants to be with me forever. But I canâ€™t stand the way I feel in that moment when heâ€™s in his mood.  It sticks with me for the night, and he expects me to snap my fingers and be back to â€œnormalâ€ in an instant.",bipolar_disorder
"Could I be experiencing a manic episode? For context, I have anxiety, and I take fluoxetine for it, also I suspect I MAY have ADHD but I have never been able to be diagnosed. The symptoms I am experiencing are so. Strange. For weeks and weeks I go through what I would call mood swings, I'll be extremely sad for literally no reason and also simultaneously feel extremely empty. But then it's like my mood changes like a switch, and I'm normal again in the presence of people, and others I feel extremely happy and full of energy for no discernable. Usually I have none, and stay in bed. I have trouble concentrating (though I always have had this but it's worse), I have racing thoughts a lot, sometimes I sleep for an extremely long time or very little. Regardless i usually feel a brain fog impacting how I think. I feel a little out of control, I definitely know something is wrong but I have no idea what, and it bugs me to no end because I don't even know where to begin in seeking help. I also have trouble empathizing with the people around me, its making it difficult for me to be around them. A lot of my symptoms sound so similar to ADHD, anxiety and depression. But just simply having ADHD doesn't seem right, not all of my symptoms line up. I'm just so confused

"I been diagnosed bipolar for over 5 years now, currently seeing a psychiatrist for my meds, and a social worker for my therapy help. I have not worked in a few years due to this illness, and I still have manic/depressive episode at least a few times or more every year. 

Late last year, I had a really bad manic episode, Delusional I harmed myself, scarring my arms. I was not institutionalize, lucky my friends and family understand what was happening and didn't have me committed.

I realize working would not be a choice for me. After trying to applying for SSI benefits, I was turned down. I talked to my doctor about it, he told me he will release my records but he wouldn't fill out any forms or show up to any court stuff. He knows my bipolar is bad to the point where I harmed myself. I think he fears having legal ramifications so he is hesitate to help with the SSI.

I am now talking to a disability lawyer on my appeal case, they recommended that I get the doctor to fill out a RFC questionnaire that details the mental illness etc. I have a feeling he will refuse as well.

The sad part is I been going to this doctor for years, and I have learned this isn't uncommon for doctors to not want to deal with SSI stuff, can anyone give me some advice from their experiences fighting for their disability case? Did you run across doctors that won't help because of similar reason.

My lawyer's paralegal doesn't seem like they are helping to convince my doctors to help out either, I feel like the lawyers should help call the doctors office and push a bit for them, I mean I am paying them if we win, they can at least get off their asses and help, am I wrong in thinking this way? Should I be talking to another more aggressive law office ? They don't seem to care about getting the evidence for my appeal with any haste. 

I feel so trapped in this situation and frankly feeling hopeless and depressed, this entire process has been long and draining. Any advice would help, kindly thank you everyone.",bipolar_disorder

"Hiâ€¦ my best friend &amp; I both have a family history of BP. I have known her for long enough to know that she has changed drastically in the last year. None of this is coming from a place of judgment. Having grown up w/ a BP mother - Iâ€™m not just observing it, I am being triggered by her behavior which is how I started to notice it. She has cried to me about being over scheduled &amp; tells me sheâ€™ll prioritize rest, but after each burnout she immediately takes on more jobs or commitments and ramps up even more. She has developed paranoia, her apartment is boarded up, out of character anger outbursts to strangers, and I can hear the vocal fry &amp; speed in her voice when she begins to go off on a long rant. (She often complains about money to me which is rough on me bc I am always living check to check). She now has 3 demanding jobs and keeps adding more to her workload to the point she is physically ill and having to make ER visits. I am not any kind of professional, but it is reminding me of my lived experience. I used to experience manic episodes myself until I did several years of treatment for complex PTSD. I think from the outside it looks like over achievement, which is celebrated in our society, and I honestly donâ€™t think anyone else will say anything. Itâ€™s getting harder for me to talk honestly to her bc she is interpreting everything as a personal failure.

What can I do to support her to seek professional help? Obviously the choice has to come from her. I am coming from a place of love and also a need have my own boundaries, bc i donâ€™t have the capacity to continue this way. Did anyone help you by reflecting your behavior back to you? Did anyone say anything that made you feel safe and supported? I listed examples above, but I donâ€™t think if that will helpful in convo.

Another complexity of this situation is that, she is a medical professional herself and involved with a group with a lot of cult like dynamics and uses alternative medicine â€œtherapyâ€. She invited me to join the group &amp; every alarm bell in my body went off with their group leader/ bc there was an incredible abuse of power, as well as MLM schemes so this â€œtherapistâ€ is selling healing water to her patients.

"So I've been taking lamictal now for a few months at 100 twice a day. I recently started wellbutrin XL and am now at 300mg. Anyways, I don't know if it's the combination of these medicines, if I always felt like this before the wellbutrin... I can't remember. The problem I'm having is like crazy repetitive thoughts. I don't know what it's called... Is it intrusive? I'm not sure. For example I'll wake up with a verse of a song in my head(I'm a musician) and I have that verse repeat over and over and over and over in my head... Like uncontrollable, I can't stop and it speeds up. Another example is ill here a certain phrase or sentence and that sentence repeats in my head over and over and over. I feel like I'm going crazy.. And it's giving me so much anxiety because I feel like I'm not in control of my thoughts. Nothing suicidal or anything about hurting myself... But crazy because I can't stop these annoying repetitions in my head! I also have ADD so idk if that's also something that's causing this.. But no because I've NEVER had this problem before. I told my psychiatrist this and this is when he upped both medication doses and I feel like it's getting worse! It's been about a week since my upped dose. I have another appointment in about another week and I'm not sure whether to stop the meds now or just power through and talk to him about it again.

TLDR: My brain keeps repeating thoughts over and over again without control and it's driving me mad!",bipolar_disorder
"I was diagnosed with bipolar I and ADHD a few months ago. I remember being fairly outgoing as a kid but in high school I suddenly got much more reserved and anxious. I thought it was something I would grow out of but Iâ€™m 25 and I feel like itâ€™s only gotten worse. When I have anxiety attacks it literally feels PARALYZING. I cannot think of what to say, I become very quiet, my muscles tense up, I have a hard time with eye contact, I start stuttering, etc. I become hyper aware of my posture and every movement Iâ€™m making. This happens mostly with people I donâ€™t know very well. On random occasions (Iâ€™m assuming when Iâ€™m manic) I become very  confident and outgoing, i get loud, I want to make spontaneous plans and do things, and I just feel normal. 

I read that anxiety disorders are comorbid with bipolar so I just want to see how many people struggle with this as well.",bipolar_disorder
"Hi guys, I'll preface this by saying I started having thoughts again that I might have bipolar disorder and the first time I had this thought was about a year ago when I was looking up the symptoms of my months-long high followed by very terrible months-long low (which ended up WAY longer than my high) and bipolar disorder is what came up, and I related to almost all of the symptoms in both descriptors of the mania and depression. I brought this up to my doctor at the time and asked him how I could get diagnosed. He told me he wouldn't refer me to someone who could diagnose me but would test if Abilify helped. I seriously don't remember if it did or not--it was such a confusing time for me mentally, and I remember stopping the Abilify on a whim--I was just tired of it or something. So over time, I started doubting the idea of having biploar bc I was tired of my doctor just testing meds on me--just started to even forget about the concept.

But now that I've fallen into another big depressive phase, especially right after planning so many commitments, in what I believe would have been in a state of mania, I've started feeling really anxious about what to do about those commitments and how I'm going to even succeed in them, or make it through them. (On top of that it's been kind of upsetting bc just a week or two ago I was actually excited to do those thing as well!) I suddenly had that memory of how my doctor didn't tell me where to go for a diagnosis, and I feel as if I'm reliving all the symptoms that got me on the internet discovering what bipolar was in the first place. 

Long story short--who do I go to for a diagnosis? A psychologist, a psychiatrist? I don't want to just ask my doctor again since he for some reason didn't want to give me the answer the first time (okay, he GAVE a reason for that, but it made no sense to me, and idk if I'd accidently be giving out personal info by detailing that). Just wanna know how to take the next step! Thank you guys! :) 

(Lastly, I did read all the rules about not being a diagnosed poster on this subreddit, and also not seeking professional help--I didn't really think this was seeking professional help, but more like asking where to GO for it lol. But if this post isn't allowed, I understand. Sorry for the inconvenience in that case!)",bipolar_disorder

"So I struggle with mental health issues, and a lot of it is related to drinking but not sure if anyone has similar issues.

To preface, I donâ€™t drink during the week, but drink heavily on Fridays and Saturdays only.  I sometimes will wake up and have racing thoughts, paranoia, and very real â€œfalse memoriesâ€ that whenever I ask people about, arenâ€™t real. Itâ€™s very delusional. They usually involve having all these conversations with people, or people screaming at me, or getting in enormous fights in my head, or me having done or said something bad. I have trouble telling whether itâ€™s real or not, but whenever I ask people, itâ€™s not real. Ive gotten really angry with my friends and cussed them out/accused them of things I swore up and down happened and had vivid memories of and accuse them of lying even when they swear to me it isnâ€™t true. Iâ€™ve had rapid mood swings, wear Iâ€™ve had memories of things that didnâ€™t happen that made me so happy I was balling crying, then angry, then depressed. This will go on for at least a month sometimes and I have trouble sleeping. 

I was diagnosed with OCD, social anxiety, and depression back in 2020, by a PHD clinical psychologist and was seeing a psychiatrist( nurse practitioner)for a long time- now I have to switch due to new telehealth laws. I have long believed that these â€œfalse memoriesâ€ were intrusive thoughts, and my constant questioning to my friends and other people were compulsions to gain certainty over these memories. Exposure therapy doesnâ€™t seem to help stop the intrusive/racing thoughts.

Just saw a new psychiatry nurse practitioner who evaluated me for 30 minutes, and was diagnosed with bipolar depression. She believes Iâ€™m having delusions, and wants to treat my racing thoughts. Antipsychotics(olanzapine) didnâ€™t work for me in the past at stopping racing thoughts, but she wants me to try Latuda, and stop taking my SSRI. This is a big step, and Iâ€™m not sure what to do. Do I see a new psychiatrist and continue trying to get treated for OCD, or do I quit my SSRI and take Latuda? Does any of this sound familiar to anyone?
I realize most people hear arenâ€™t doctors but would like advice. Main diagnostic issue is are my intrusive thoughts actually intrusive(which can seem delusional) or are they paranoid delusions a part of something else. Any insight would be great!",bipolar_disorder

"Hi all! 

Diagnosed BP tp 1, not currently medicated (not for lack of trying). I have it pretty well under control for the most part. I look for early signals of mania and slow down my life, stop going out, focus on health and staying home, etc. This typically makes the manic episodes less destructive and the downswings less bad. That being said, I still have cycles.

I'm manic now. Typical symptoms - lack of sleep, rapid thoughts, easily agitated, the need to party harder than anyone else, highly productive workdays, etc. 

Anyway. Lately, these manic episodes have been pretty...intense. I feel like I'm vibrating. This one is a bit overwhelming. My brain is screaming more than normal.

My question is - is there anything anyone does that helps slow them down a bit through their peaks?

A lot of questions, I know, but Iâ€™m 1 year in and very treatment resistant so itâ€™s been a miserable year. I found out I was bipolar from being hospitalized from a mixed episode. Almost exactly a year later, Iâ€™m having another episode but itâ€™s depression and the most unbearable depression Iâ€™ve ever felt.

Today I had a job interview. It went okay, but I left feeling like they saw me as a weird kid, even though the people interviewing me was about the same age as me.

I also felt like a fraud. I tried to tell them about my experience and what I know, but everything I have is just a rambling brain that sometimes can be directed at problems and solve them. I can't pick up a fucking book. I can't really focus enough to learn anything properly.

The results were not at all surprising but definitely disheartening. I'm too amped up all the time and that impacts my memory retention. It also makes me feel exhausted all the time. She did bring up impulsivity and ADHD symptoms for the first time. That was a first suggestion I might have it, so a bit scary, but not surprising.

After the call I talked to my husband about the results and how frustrated I feel because I've been trying to meditate (and often doing it) for years, but I still feel this way and struggle with memory. All he wanted to do was fix me. He just kept asking questions about how to change and how I want to be, etc etc. I tried to tell him to stop but he doesn't get it. He thinks because he can 'hack' his brain to change behavior I should be able to just as easily. But I'm bipolar and I struggle in ways he can't comprehend. I just want some empathy. Some kindness. Anything but 'figure out how to be different!'. I'm so sad and have to go back to work. Ugh. At least it'll be distracting.

"This is very specific but worth a shot. I never had experience with kids in my family, mostly because the majority of my close-in-age family members decided to not have kids. I don't think those that did even trusted me to be around their kids when I was in my early adulthood, though no one mentioned it. I also have decided not to have children of my own. Long story short, I'd like to be a therapist/speech language pathologist, but I have next to no experience with children. I know I can get started simply by working in a kid-centered job, but I'm super anxious about that prospect and was curious if anyone has had similar thoughts.

I know many people out here are parents themselves. I've spoken to parents who say that having children provided them with a reason to be, and they actually recommend having them. I also talked to people who said although they loved their kid, they highly don't recommend having them as they made their mental illness 10x worse. I'm not looking for opinions about having children, just working with them. Would you honestly trust another bipolar person around your kids?

I had just gotten out of a 10 month long depressive episode where i tried to â€˜end itâ€™ multiple times and my life was going to crap. And everything started to make sense. But im starting to doubt it now.

Ive noticed i have periods of sudden suicidal ideations/temptations even if i had been feeling incredibly happy for days before hand, i try to overdose and will cut off contact with family and friends then a day or even a few hours later im fine again. Nothing triggers these â€œbreakdownsâ€, they just happen. Id randomly cry my eyes out and yell at everyone then ill be overly social, making plans, studying and  happy again.

A big part of this confusion is the fact that im fifteen. I was professionally diagnosed and all, and im currently on prozac. But i still feel like im â€œlyingâ€ or â€œmaking this a big dealâ€ because i feel i cant be â€œillâ€ at 15. Even though its ruining my life.

My friends donâ€™t care, my family expects me to â€˜feel all betterâ€™ just because i got diagnosed, i still feel like shit.

These breakdowns are the worst part of it. They last hours or 3 days at most so my parents dont take them seriously but theyâ€™re very severe, i try to run away or randomly fight with people during them. And i feel horrible about it.

Unfortunately one of my classmates is writing a story about what he describes as a 'bipolar/psychotic serial killer.' As someone who has had psychotic episodes and whose mental health team is trying to decide between a BPD and Bipolar diagnosis, this is uncomfortable territory for me. Especially since I've been hospitalized a few times and have had breakdowns just out of paranoia that I'll hurt someone. It's nuanced because part of me feels that I need to accept that it's not a direct attack on me and that there are many people with psychosis/bipolar who are bad people and I can separate myself from that. And part of me wants to help my classmate improve his script by suggesting this nuance I've had to accept. But it's also difficult when I'm in a midst of a conversation that reflects things I've experienced like they're a horror movie. I try to be open about my mental health struggles because I hate how taboo and stigmatized it all is but it's shit like this that makes it harder and harder. Even more layers are added because the guy in my class is an old classmate from elementary school. I think he might have a crush on me, or he might have thought I was attractive before I was revealed to be a reflection of his crazy serial killer character. This is evident because after I discussed my concerns in class he canceled plans we had to work on our scripts together. He said it was because of work but he seemed too overly apologetic for something he apparently couldn't control. It's also dumb that I even care cuz I am not interested in him romantically. But it just pains me that there's even a possibility that someone I do like in the future will act the same way. I just wanted to vent because I don't even know what I'm angry about. Just life I guess. Bluh.",bipolar_disorder
"i called my stupid doctor and she wrote me stupid new scripts for my stupid meds. she gave me an earful about stopping the meds, especially cold turkey, without rhyme, reason or consultation. 

i truly don't know why i stopped taking them. i pushed my spindo for my daily dose and nothing popped out. i pressed a couple more times. nope, totally empty. and i just never refilled the spindo or my meds at the pharmacy. 

my whole life is unravelling around me right now and all i want to do is go to sleep and not wake up for a couple of days. a good depression would have facilitated that but no, had to go the other way and now i'm so jacked up on thoughts that i can barely blink.

 but im taking my meds and next time one if y'all needs to stop me *before* i shit the bed, not after.

"Iâ€™m on Lamictal, which is working pretty well. I see a therapist weekly, and I make sure to keep a good routine with exercise. I run, do yoga, and lift weights. These things help me tremendously. 

But recently I incurred a running injury and a shoulder injury (from weight training). So Iâ€™m having to take time off from running and any type of exercise that involves putting any weight on my right arm. I can only do yin yoga at this point. 

But Iâ€™ve found myself in a position where Iâ€™m going to have to take a couple of weeks off from pretty much all exercise (even walking (my toe got messed up from a 10 mile run)). 

So that thing thatâ€™s always been so therapeutic for meâ€¦ I canâ€™t do it right now. I depend on it, and Iâ€™ve become super depressed now that I canâ€™t do it. 

Iâ€™ve been doing so good lately. Not being able to exercise has messed me up pretty bad. And what adds insult to injury is that I live in Houston, where we only have a short period of the year with good weather for outdoor exercise. The feeling of missing out is just killing me. Iâ€™m just sitting around watching Always Sunny all day. 

Any advice on what to do in this situation would be most appreciated.",bipolar_disorder

How can I ensure I get more sleep? More sleeping pills? I am unmedicated in terms of stabilisation meds. Had 4 mania episodes and 3 depression episodes since 2016. I feel it coming again. I can see a degradation of symptoms, the mania is less severe as the first one in 2016. Depression becomes longer. Last time I was in hospital for mania was 2017 and the last 3 mania episodes where manageable with good support. Good news is I catch the symptoms very early on.

That deep dark sinking feeling that you canâ€™t stop whatâ€™s coming but you know itâ€™s just around the corner. All you can do is handle whatâ€™s right in front of you, but itâ€™s not enough. It canâ€™t be enough to pull you from your own mind and what it will do to you. Please tell me you guys understand that feeling.

"...it's over.

It's been thirty five months now since the first signs of trouble. That's somewhere around 10% of my entire life so far. 10% of my life spent spiralling, fluctuating, climbing, falling, succeeding, failing, crashing. 10% of my life watching what I had built with it fall apart piece by piece, powerless to stop it, reluctant and incapable of rebuilding.

It was seven months from the first sign of trouble before I finally obtained a proper diagnosis and began the proper treatment. The two months hence confirmed everyone's suspicions: that the damage was done.

And so twenty five months ago fell not the first domino, but the one that could've served as a firebreak had it stood firm. I was told by a psychiatrist that it was time I took a break to recover and reassess my direction in life now knowing what I knew. I agreed - there really wasn't any other safe choice. My employer and I parted ways and I applied for state benefits to see me through.

I thought I'd take a six month break at most. I thought that would be enough. I was of course wrong to imagine I could set a timeline on it.

Fourteen months ago following a prolonged and immense campaign of support from my family and friends the levee finally broke and I had no choice but to give up my home - the last scrap of my independence. And for fourteen months through the continuance of that campaign of support I've been sat here as a so-called-temporary housemate of a close family member struggling - *struggling* - with the immense task that is scaling this mountain that life had built for me; the goal attainable at the peak - secure and safe independence - towering higher every day.

And now, at last, that struggle is ending.

Through months of fighting with myself on my goals and aspirations, my health and stability, my apathy and my dread, I've *finally* found the courage and the appetite to find myself a job. And it's a *good* job, too. It should serve my immediate needs as well as the needs of my mid and long term future selves whether they be well, unwell, comfortable, itching for more or else. The peak is finally visible, and I can for the first time measure how long it'll take for me to arrive. 

I didn't expect to feel *good* when I finally made this breakthrough, but I do! It really is the first and hardest step, the core struggle I've been dealing with for so long now, and that I've figured it out is *huge*. As much as I may have chastised myself on occasion over the interim for somewhat mythologizing what I've been through, I have to allow myself the grace of understanding that what I went through *was* traumatic and that it *did* represent a kind of transformative paradigm shift in my life that in effect justifies the ripples it affected. It took a long time because it was *always going to* take a long time; my absolute recovery hinges on my willingness and enthusiasm for employment because that my capability for it disintegrated is why I'm here thirty five months down the line.

This is the first moment I've been confident that I'll be able to look back on as the moment the clock stopped counting up on the duration of this chaos. So for me it feels now that while there is still work to do, I can finally say that this nightmare is *over*.

While I maintain no illusion that what comes next is easy, I am - for the first time in 10% of my life so far - ready for it.

"I started taking Lamictal 25mg consistently 3 weeks ago. My period was supposed to have come a week ago and Iâ€™m regular. I'm basically without the PMS I usually have: sore breasts, spotting and a lot of cramping. I'm just feeling very swollen overall, including my breasts - but no pain. This is freaking me out because I don't remember having a period that was so late and without PMS. There is a very low chance that I am pregnant. I take care of myself as much as I can because I have tokophobia (pregnancy phobia). My bf and I always use condoms, I have a copper IUD and we do pull-out (w/ condom, of course). And the last time we had, I was in my dry days. 

The only thing new to my routine is Lamictal. I'm so paranoid about a possible pregnancy. I can't stop thinking about it. I don't have the courage at the moment to take a test because I'm so afraid of this tiny chance of pregnancy being real. I'm in the finals and I can't study. I feel fuckinâ€™ stupid because I'm a biochemistry undergraduate student and I've studied a lot of things that can delay period other than pregnancy but I can't be rational at moment and I'm in hypomania. I'm thinking of taking Lamictal off for a few days to see if my period comes but I'm not sure it's a good idea. I canâ€™t go to the doctor for now. I donâ€™t know what else to do.

i've had head aches, terrible mood swings, reckless behavior (risky driving, substance use, shopping too much), been restless, fatigued, and so horribly horribly depressed. this is a certain type of depression that ppl withdrawing from drugs have. it's deeper and more intense than anything i've ever felt before. last night i relapsed with self harm (punching myself) and screamed at the top of my lungs for the first time in years, while sobbing.

The chiropractor only done an xray of the lower part of my back. She didn't xray my middle or upper back. What if I have a nerve pressing against my brain or some shit? Wouldn't that mess me up and give me bipolar-like symptoms and explain why bipolar medication isn't working to treat it? Hmm... I suppose my next course of action is to find a rheumatologist or someone who can order a CT scan (with dye) to get a look at my brain and see what's going on. Idk. I'm not a doctor.

I started seeing a new psych and when we were trying to figure out a sleep option I hadnâ€™t tried, I mentioned Latuda being really the only thing to work for me without all the stupid side effects. She said sheâ€™d ask her colleagues and do some research and learned itâ€™s going generic for Medicaid early 2023! I have insurance through my hospital job, a private one, and when she said sheâ€™d send in a 30 day prescription just to see I thought thereâ€™d be no way. 

The Walgreens app showed my co-pay at a little over $1,800 and I wasnâ€™t even super disappointed tbh because I knew thatâ€™s what would happen. But! A few days later I checked again and it was accepted through my insurance and my co-pay went down to $30 :â€™) I cried seeing that and cried even harder when I picked up the physical bottle. 

It does seem like nothing lol but this was such a huge win for me. I was so emotional and happy and relieved. Just wanted to share because I want to tell everyone lol and hope this might be helpful for someone who also have had a short success on it but couldnâ€™t afford the outrageous price.",bipolar_disorder

22f here diagnosed with BPII 3 years ago. I have been dating my current partner for 6 months now. I can see I have engaged in some seriously problematic attention-seeking behaviors. 


some examples include: 

1) trying to walk into traffic

2) cutting myself badly after an argument (I hadnâ€™t self-harmed in 2 years prior to this) 

3) exaggerating my emotions (purposefully) when he hurts my feelings 


Iâ€™m very aware these behaviors are ridiculously toxic. I wasnâ€™t actually able to understand how scary and burdensome my actions were on my partner until I did some serious self-reflection when they brought it up to me. I struggle a lot with seeing my own faults. 

Iâ€™ve been doing some research and havenâ€™t found a lot of studies or articles on this.

"When I was 17 I was a good student, had lots of friends, was liked by my teachers and was known for always smiling. By 18 I was failing my classes, skipped school, got in trouble constantly and had no friends. Instead of smiling I was asked a lot, â€œare you okay?â€. By the end of my senior year I was planning to unalive myself. I want to share with you the moment I decided to fight my illness with everything I had. I still think about this moment when things get tough. I hope it might help one of you. 

I went to a church conference (this isnâ€™t a religious story. Just the setting lol.). I had gone the year before and had a great time. This time I lived in my room. On the last day the lead minister gave a speech. What he said was life changing for me:

Some of us will be stalked by the dark dogs of depression. Some of us will lose them in the forest but for the rest of us they will hunt us to the edge of a raging river. On the other side is a rope laying on the water, tied to a tree. It is at that moment that we must choose. Do we surrender to the dogs, or do we jump into the river and swim for the rope? The water will be cold. At times it will feel like youâ€™re drowning. Fighting the current will exhaust you. But over time you will withstand the cold better, you will hold your breath longer and fighting the rapids will make you stronger. It is through your own strength, determination and resiliency that you will find land again. But you need to make that first brave step into the water not knowing if you will make it to the other side. 

I didnâ€™t want to surrender. I would rather die fighting for my life. When I got home I told my mom to take me to the hospital. That was the start of my journey. The years that followed were hell - not gonna lie. But I eventually reached the shore. Iâ€™m not the same person and I still have bipolar symptoms sometimes.

"I (23F) am diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder and believe I actually have ADHD. Multiple psychiatrists have initially considered an ADHD diagnosis, but after learning I performed well in school, my concerns were not taken seriously.

Today, I learned that the only reason I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder is because I had a Prozac-induced ""manic episode"" at 19 while in an eating disorder treatment program. Essentially, because my psychiatrist believed I experienced a manic episode while on Prozac, I was diagnosed and it was never questioned. Aside from my time on Prozac, I have *never* experienced a manic or depressive episode. My *baseline* temperament is very energetic, talkative, and honestly might look like mania. The difference is that it is constant and not episodic.

I'm not fully convinced I experienced a manic episode on Prozac. **I am curious if others think my Prozac experience was mania or something else.** This is relevant because if my time on prozac was not a manic episode, my diagnosis will probably change and I may receive a diagnosis (ADHD) that actually fits my symptoms.

Some of the symptoms I displayed while on Prozac, such as distractibility, talkativeness, and racing thoughts, are symptoms I experience all the time. I did not (and never have) experience a sense of euphoria and self-confidence. At that time, my self-confidence was very low.

I was sleeping less, but it was because I began working a job with a start time of 4:30am. What may have seemed like impulsivity related to mania (signing up for a half marathon without training), was in fact normal for me; I'm a runner, it's something I enjoy, and I continue to sign up for big races last minute without experiencing a manic episode. I had no increased goal-directed behavior and no impulsive behaviors aside from the race.

Was this a manic episode, or was it ADHD masked as one? Medication and treatment for bipolar has never had an effect on my most debilitating symptoms that fall in line with an ADHD diagnosis. If my experience was not a manic episode, there is no other evidence to suggest I have bipolar disorder considering I do not experience mood episodes.

"I mean not really, but I donâ€™t want to hook up with strangers anymore.

I went to my GYN a couple of weeks ago and found out I have a lot of pelvic issues that were causing pain when I masturbated. She put me on meds to fix that. And oh did it.

I ended up buying a different kind of vibrator than the one I had to test when or if the meds were working. Iâ€™ve never been able to masturbate because it was always really painful. As a result, I always wanted to hook up with strangers when hypersexual because I thought I was doing something wrong and was really frustrated all the time. Now, I do not need another person to get me off.

"Hi. I (26F) was diagnosed with bipolar 1 early 2021. Before I was diagnosed, I experienced the most extreme manic episode Iâ€™ve ever had, followed by - or entering, idk - what I (and my therapist) believe to have been psychosis. After I came down, I was catatonic. I donâ€™t remember how long the episode/psychosis/catatonia lasted, I just remember how it all felt. Anyways, I was never hospitalized. My husband and I had no clue what was going on. 

Fast forward a few months, I was put on a medication that REALLY worked for me (as well as therapy). I was neutral. Like, actually normal for once. It was incredible. Iâ€™ve stayed on my medication for over a year and didnâ€™t experience much of my mood swings.

Unfortunately, Iâ€™ve run out of medication. Iâ€™m on a medication assistance program, but thereâ€™s screwy shit going on with it (long, long explanation) and they wonâ€™t give me anymore medication. I donâ€™t know when I will get it again. A 30-day supply is almost $1,400 USD and I absolutely cannot afford that.

Currently, Iâ€™m coming up on a manic episode. I feel it, I know the signs, I know whatâ€™s going on with my brain now. 

Iâ€™m TERRIFIED. Iâ€™m so unbelievably fucking scared. The last time I had a manic episode, I was literally psychotic. Sometimes I still get triggered by little things that remind me of the episode and I just.. tbh, I freak the fuck out. It REALLY fucked me up. Iâ€™m so worried that Iâ€™ll get too deep this time. 

Right now, Iâ€™m just experiencing irritability, anger from nowhere, racing thoughts, and a decreased need for sleep. Itâ€™s manageable.. but what about when itâ€™s not? 

I have my husband.. heâ€™s my support system (and heâ€™s fucking INCREDIBLE) but what about when itâ€™s too much for him? He cannot handle psychosis and Iâ€™ve made him promise to hospitalize me if he suspects it. Thereâ€™s that, I guess. 

Iâ€™m scared for myself. Iâ€™m scared for what might happen. Iâ€™m scared of the hallucinations. Iâ€™m scared of the thoughts. Iâ€™m scared of what Iâ€™ll do.

"So I am newly diagnosed and still figuring things out. I have been on Latuda now for almost two months, my dose increased about 4 days to 40mg from 20mg. 

I swear this drug is making me hypomanic but I just can't tell. I do know it's not preventing hypomania that's for sure. 

Before I started I was pretty sure I was in a level state (kinda in a healing reflective state after a ywar of manic/hypo/mixed/depression). Within two days of starting my mood got happier and productivity went up. I vibed in there along with some spikes into racing thoughts, irritability and panic attacks. My dose went up and I slept hard (11 hours) and felt great. Then I went up again and feel amazing. The list of things I can do in a day is even BIGGER. But I am also trying to find ways to spend all my savings and almost bought an iPad last night (currently living on social services so that would have been my hard saved for emergency funds). 

I really enjoy how this feels, esp since the irritability seems mostly gone. I am planning on starting photography again, writing a book for nanaowrimo, exercising every day, getting more tattoos and a piercing, doing an drawing class, decorating my house, getting nicer clothes because I deserve nice things too....

If I can figure out a way to stop the spending and the desire for sex this would be great. Normally this time of year I am a stressed, anxious, irritable mess. Just in time to crash for Christmas. But I am not getting my crash is coming symptoms so this may last all winter which would be super exciting.  November to March/April is my sad times.

Anyways. I have an appt on Friday with new psychiatrist who is part of the intensive outpatient therapy program I am enrolled in.  I am scared he will do something and take away my happy mood. I don't wanna lose it. I don't want to be sad and depressed. But my logic brain says if I can find a way to tone it down just a wee bit that might be good. So that I don't go broke (or more broke as it is). 

Is it OK to try to stay hypomanic? Level was so boring and not productive. And it's not like they are going to get my meds correct right away anyways. Right now I am in good spirits and want to do something fun. I have enough energy to do the should-do's and want-to's. 

Anyways, I have been up and then upper occasionally, then crash back to up. And my up level seems a bit higher (and more expensive) since I got the higher dose. And that iPad sure does look pretty, and all the cool things I could do on it. I could be really productive and even get my life organized for once with it, and the colors are so pretty! But yeah. I don't become psychotic and delusional, although last winter I had some sort of mixed episode where I massively paranoid, unhappy and borderline wanted to take myself out. And the highest I got saw me dating 3 people at once and setting up an only fans (but not posting content!) before I crashed. So nothing too bad overall, semi manageable except for when I wanted to die but that was just occasional intrusive thoughts and I would not do it because I have kids to be here for.

Good morning everyone. I am type one bipolar and I have been noticing a few things that have been happening but I wanted to make sure. Normally I donâ€™t really do my makeup and I tend to keep to myself. If anything I just want to be a fly on the wall so to speak. The past I want to say four days I have been doing my hair and my makeup and walking around with more confidence. I have been sleeping between 5-6 hours a night when I normally sleep 9. I have been waking up earlier and find it hard to go back to sleep and I have been having a hard time tossing and turning trying to fall asleep. I am also more alert. I just wanted to know what Iâ€™m dealing with. Thanks all.,bipolar_disorder
"So my sex drive seems to be low or nonexistent however whenever Iâ€™m with my boyfriend everything seems normal.

I used to have a higher drive, I seem to have lost all interest in masturbation recently. It doesnâ€™t help that me and my boyfriend donâ€™t sext, there just isnâ€™t really time for it either.

Iâ€™ve been learning to navigate life with this disorder since 2017, Iâ€™m assuming Iâ€™m like this due to depression, but then my sex drive is normal when Iâ€™m around him?

"When I was in junior year of high school I told my AP Psych Teacher that I had been diagnosed with bipolar 2, then asked her if id be able to be in a healthy relationship. She told me that it was up to me, it could be unfair to my partner if Iâ€™m having swings left and right and would probably be best if I was seeing a therapist and getting medicated. Since then Iâ€™ve probably had two â€œflingsâ€ that basically went no where. Been recently trying to work on myself by meditating and trying to focus on the present moment and things around me, sometimes I have good day, sometimes theyâ€™re bad but ultimately i feel a bit better, so I wanted to ask how yâ€™allâ€™s experience have been with relationships and if yâ€™all found anything that mightâ€™ve helped.

"Anyone with multiple conditions? Iâ€™ll never know if epilepsy was really meant for me or not. I donâ€™t know if bipolar came first. A normal MRI in 2019 after my first seizure, scarring as of January 2022 in my left temporal lobe. I donâ€™t know what if currentmy manic episode is due to bipolar or epilepsy and brain damage. I canâ€™t work, stayed up 80 hours last week straight. I canâ€™t get my life back feels like. Applying for SSD today, canâ€™t drive so often because I get so many auras lately. I never know anymore. I guess Iâ€™m just tired. I wish I knew how bad it gets, because the longer I wait around it seems my prognosis gets worse. Hearing about eventual brain surgery in the neurologists office yesterday was startling. I wish I knew. I never had epilepsy before, was diagnosed in 2019 after two seizures a few months apart. I was diagnosed bipolar in 2017, and many anticonvulsants I started on were for bipolar first. But now yes, Iâ€™m like, did epilepsy happen because of bipolar? Was I supposed to be epileptic before? Didnâ€™t start getting auras before my seizure in 2020, now I get them all the time (auras). I wish I could hold down a job and get my life together, but I truly donâ€™t even know why itâ€™s like this to begin with. Thereâ€™s no point in asking why me, and I should be grateful that things arenâ€™t worse.

"I messed up at work with one of my clients and kept forgetting to put her morning meds out. Iâ€™ve been working like crazy, doing the caretaking as well as house sitting, catering events, and a weekend restaurant gig, but itâ€™s no excuse. 

So this client had dropped me, leaving me with far less hours, and a mess Iâ€™ll have to explain to my agency. 

Overall I donâ€™t want to do this job, which is eye opening. I was in school because I thought I wanted to be a nurse, but I donâ€™t know if I want that anymore. The caretaking has showed me just how stressful caring for others can be and idk if I can handle it. I like science, and I like health stuff, but it doesnâ€™t feel like my calling.

Im house sitting right now, and soon I need to feed 80 animals, clean out my car, and get to work by 9:30. I wanna cry, I feel like a failure, and I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing with my life.

"So a few years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar. I no longer meet any of their criteria and so I'm pretty sure I'm recovered. At least ADHD is no longer there I'm kinda hyperfocused. But the thing is I have doubts about Bipolar. I still have mood swings but I feel the manic phase never left me. 

Even when I'm depressed, I still have feelings of invincibility, high risk taking. 

And when I'm not depressed Its just a different ball game. Extreme ambitiousness, Euphoria, Hysterically laughing and smiling, high self esteem and a feeling that nothing can stop me

Not that I complain, its just that I have been thinking about when i was younger and I was nothing like this. Perhaps its who I am? Or perhaps its manic phase that's been going for years?

"I love my boyfriend very much. We've been together for over 2 years, cohabitate and are pet parents of two cats and a bearded dragon. He's put up with me through all of my nonsense including manic, depressive and mixed states, an emergency hospital stay and surgery, IOP, and being jobless and penniless. 

He's honestly amazing and handles it all with minimal fuss. I don't know if I could do it were I in his shoes.

So, I feel horribly guilty and like a terrible person when I'm  unwell and all I can see is the negative aspects of our relationship. It's all things that don't bother me (much) when I'm well and balanced,  but when I'm like this, I feel so unheard and and unseen and neglected. I feel like these little things I ask for and don't recieve aren't very difficult to do and wouldn't take much time out of his day so he must not want to do them and that means he doesn't care about me and I should just leave since I'm such a huge handful and a burden to deal with anyway. 

I know how ridiculous it sounds, but I'm stuck in this mental and emotional loop. I'm just so upset and hurt and I feel so dumb for being this emotional. And I really don't want to bring it up to him and start the same argument all over again.

I'm starting with a new therapist and medication management tomorrow, and hopefully some new or increased meds because seroquel, while giving me the best sleep I've had in years, isn't doing much mood stabilizing for me.

"Dialectical Behavioral Therapy was a life saver for me.  Coupled with an intense workout routine, Iâ€™ve been able to go with minimal medications.  I still abuse alcohol and nicotine but not nearly to the same excess. That is next on my list to conquer. I thought Iâ€™d pass it along for those whoâ€™ve never tried DBT. I did 2 rounds of 8 month group sessions, took the â€œhomeworkâ€ assignments very seriously, etc. I donâ€™t believe you can reap the benefits by just going through the motions.  Everyone is different, and I do not propose going off ANY medication without careful monitoring and advice of your doctors.  But for me, DBT was a life changing.

"To start this off, i know Iâ€™m a shitty person. This is one of the first times Iâ€™m taking accountability for something so for me to post this is taking a lot.

With that said, Iâ€™m pretty sure drinking triggers my hypomania. I know drinking alcohol alone can inhibit your decision making skills but this is beyond that.

I drank last week and I kissed someone who isnâ€™t my fiancÃ© after a night of drinking and a day of forgetting to take my meds. I told my fiancÃ© about it the next day because that guilt needed to be shared as it wasnâ€™t fair to him. We talked it through and agreed to start couples therapy.

"Hi all - wanted to ask the hive mind how y'all handle non-episodic hallucinations and paranoia. 

I've (31F) been experiencing some for the past few weeks, likely related to stress as I lost my job in there. I take my medication regularly (lithium, caplyta and as-needed 25mg seroquel), am 600 days sober, see my doctor and therapist, and am communicating this to those close to me. Mainly, the trigger seems to be my phone - in my past manic episodes, my phone would be sending cues through the apps, people talking to each other to talk to me, etc etc. 

This time, I'm not so much delusional but have been struggling with thoughts of everything tech possibly being a simulation, seeing things happen on my phone that aren't actually happening (i.e. attachments in messages that were never received/sent, occasional ""glitches"" that look like a coding screen that disappears quickly). A couple weeks ago, I shut off my cell plan for the time being so it's wifi only and got a 1998 landline phone to help manage, but even just wifi messaging/use is proving stressful. My doctor and therapist agree that I'm not manic at the moment. I keep hoping that since I'm aware of it, that's the best step for management, but I also know how quickly slippery things can get (and also that I won't be able to notice everything myself).   


I feel like I'm doing what I should in terms of trying to eliminate triggers and keep care close, while still living in 2022, but I'm curious how y'all handle these symptoms as they arise. I'm not even 3 years into this diagnosis so every symptom seems to be a learning opportunity. Thank you!

I have a physical illness and because of it (and financial problems), I had to stop therapy. Right now I experience since weeks a depressive episode that makes my libido.. almost non-existent. 

While she has a high libido and do our traumas: sexual desires works differently. She feels affected, extremely sad because of my low sexual desire. I canâ€™t change it.

My trauma contains too a fear of fighting and every time she mentions â€œlets talks about itâ€ it makes my skin crawl because it ends into either an argument, a slight argument or a fight.

I know for sure that I have depression.

I still really doubt it, but i read an article where it said that the emotional highs/lows happen every 2 months or less and that seems to be the case for me.

i take my meds and eat healthy, try to get consistent sleep. i donâ€™t have the energy to exercise. i also feel like i really donâ€™t have anyone i can talk to. i moved from california to maryland last december, and have only made two friends here who it doesnâ€™t seem appropriate to open up to because iâ€™ve only known them a handful of months and we rarely spend time together. 

all my california friends from highschool are busy advancing in college and with all the new friends theyâ€™re making. donâ€™t get me wrong iâ€™m very happy for them but iâ€™m definitely sad that i donâ€™t have a â€˜next stageâ€™ of my life to move onto too because iâ€™m not in school or making enough money to build a life for myself so i feel somewhat left behind by life. it also doesnâ€™t help that i have to do 100% of initiating the conversation if i want to talk to any of them; it makes me feel like a total loser and disinclines me from talking to them at all because iâ€™m worried they donâ€™t actually want to chat and only reply out of obligation. i generally keep things pretty light when i talk to them, so itâ€™s not a case of me mental illness dumping on them either. things like asking about their day, what music theyâ€™ve been listening to, etc. 

despite all that, my parents think iâ€™m fine because at least iâ€™m not having a mixed episode. i just donâ€™t know what to do. i just feel like the slog of life is never going to be worth it unless i become incredibly independently wealthy so i can move out and build my own life and not have to worry about a mood swing destroying my livelihood/sending me back to square one. thanks for reading, any input is welcome.",bipolar_disorder

2.  I thought my devices were hacked by an online bully and thought he was about to kill my mother

3. I thought there was a gang of vans stalking me because they had the same sticker

4. I thought my phone was being hacked by someone for helping out someone they might have hurt.

This past week for me, Iâ€™ve been very impulsive (got a new tattoo spur of the moment)and will clean sporadically and been drinking more then usual.

"As I begin to settle into a life of acceptance things start to slow down, time does not slow down but rather my worries of the world and how they affect me.  My mental state has become calmer, though as the wind blows there are still times of turbulence just as there are times of calmness.  Triggers, instances that will activate an emotional response, are to be recorded and avoided, not to say completely avoided but monitored to avoid a bad reaction when already traveling up or down.

Coping mechanisms are becoming less attractive.  Often, I would turn to computer gaming, as sort of a white noise, to avoid intrusive negative thoughts.  As these intrusive thoughts fade or are thought-stopped my interest in computer gaming fades, I no longer need this mechanism to go on.  It's weird to see myself let go of computer gaming, it's been there the whole journey, with a death-grasp on it.

Now I have all this time to ponder everything about myself and my surroundings, it doesn't bore me in the least.  I begin to wonder about other coping mechanisms: over-eating, excessive sleeping, bad hygiene, even excessive medication I contemplate.  I have been taking more showers and brushing my teeth more often, it doesn't seem to bother me as much.  Been sleeping less as I feel tired less often.  Although when I hunger, the Beast still has to be fed.  Would you also believe it, my psychiatrist even let me reduce one of my medications again.

Though I must always remember my limitations, as this is what defines me.  I mean after all removing computer gaming doesn't make me smarter or better at anything.  Applying pressure to myself still feels like a risky proposition, I still have some anxiety in me.  With all that I still wonder what is next in the process of moving on.

Anyways, I guess I can still call it, ""The ramblings of a madman.""",bipolar_disorder
"TW - suicide mentioned. 

My brother and I are adopted, which is relevant. My father had a horrible combination of mental diseases - addiction to alcohol was the first, or perhaps major depression too, not sure. He'd been a first responder at 9/11, not really a hardened man, the two weeks spent caused major traumatic damage to his soul and he developed PTSD. At 50, a psychologist diagnosed him with ADHD and prescribed him Adderall. From the experience of this around him, this was the point where his life declined big time. He became addicted to the Adderall, couldn't sleep and was given Ambien. Abusing, both, somehow this triggered Bipolar disorder. There were ups and downs, but when his second wife filed for divorce, he'd really felt at rock bottom again and unfortunately killed himself. I have a mistrust of psychiatrists, the one who diagnosed him with ADHD did so after meeting him once, and gave him addictive drugs that f'd him up.

My brother recently told me that a psychiatrist diagnosed him as having a minor type of bipolar disorder. My brother has ADHD, and with him that ADHD is so evident, unlike my dad's case which did not seem like a problem that was really affecting his life, if he had it at all. I'm not the expert, and I have only my dad, with multiple issues to compare my brother to. 

But in both cases, a psychiatrist has diagnosed a member of my family after meeting them one time. With another mental issue going on in the background, how can these people be confident in naming anything? My brother really acts nothing at all like my dad did. I've lived with him just a couple of years ago so had a really up close view of his life. He isn't medicated anymore for ADHD,and hasn't been since joining the military in his early 20s. I don't see the cycles my dad went through. I don't have plans on interfering in his life in any way over this, but I guess I'm just asking the question, is it normal or okay for docs to diagnose people during their first talk with them?",bipolar_disorder

My mind wanders a lot, ane sometimes i start thinking of something and a scenario pops up when my eyes are closed and it feels so real. Like I'm in a completely different place with people inknow and they seem so real. One of them touched my hair and I felt it. When i open my eyes again it's all just gone and i am where i am.

"Iâ€™m 25F and I havenâ€™t been in a relationship since I was 21. I had a terrible experience with my first long term relationship and a few guys after that. I went through a deep depressive phase and told myself I was going to â€œwork on myselfâ€ and would just meet someone naturally along the way. During manic phases, I would get hypersexual and sleep with people right away, protected or not. I guess I enjoyed it in the moment but felt so empty afterwards and usually ended up ghosting. I donâ€™t know why but anytime someone showed interest I had the urge to run in the other direction. I had one guy say that I changed after sleeping together and itâ€™s like I put a massive wall up. 

I met a guy recently when I went out for drinks with some friends. We were teasing each other through the night, I got drunk and ended up kissing him and he put his number in my phone. He messaged me the sweetest things and would call everyday. We were hanging out constantly and the sex was incredible. What honestly blew my mind was when he would just hold me close in his arms afterwards. We would fall asleep together. He would grab and hold my hand when we walked together.I felt so safe, content, and loved. Thinking about it makes me want to cry right now. I know this sounds crazy but I have never received or felt that kind of intimacy before. He kissed me goodbye one day and told me heâ€™d see me later, and then I got ghostedâ€¦ Karma. However, that experience changed my mindset and made me really desire intimacy and a true relationship.

"I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 in 2016 after a manic episode and hospitalization. When i came down from my mania i was sent straight to the bottom of a severe depressive episode. It lasted about 4 months and finally i was able to get back up and start working again. Fast forward to March of 2022, i had another manic episode and hospitalization. This time, the depression is even worse. Iâ€™ve barely been able to get out of bed since June. I tried to start working twice and had to quit both jobs due to severe depression and anxiety. Iâ€™m going on month 6 of not being able to work. I am medicated and seeing my doctors and therapist regularly. Has anyone else had symptoms so bad that they couldnâ€™t even work an entry level job?

"Iâ€™m 35(f). Iâ€™ve been on anti depressants on and off for two years. None of them worked as I later realized I was bipolar. Type two I believe. Iâ€™m now on Lamotrigine and Iâ€™m feeling so much better, still moods fluctuate but generally happy. 

Iâ€™ve recently gotten engaged and this has sparked an intense intimate desire with my partner. It feels out of character because my libido has dwindled since my depression and anxiety and being on anti depressants. I have manic ups and irritable lows. 

It feels like the Lamotrigine has heightened my bipolar symptoms or the symptoms Iâ€™ve been reading about on this sub Reddit. 

What Iâ€™d like to know, does the medication highlight bipolar symptoms more? Or is it just coincidence and Iâ€™m happy from being engaged.

"So I was on valporic acid 750, lamictal 100, Seroquel 150. Then my psych changed my meds to lamictal 200, reg Seroquel, and taper off the valporic acid. On the second day of tapering off, my stomach problems kicked in about 30 min after I took my meds and I spent about an hour vomiting. I'm assuming a great deal of the med was not absorbed, considering how I felt them on my tongue while I puked. I took another 50 Seroquel (psychs directions) and went to sleep. I'm 3 days later now, and my moods are crazy. I was sort of manic for two days? Now I'm severely dysphoric and anxious.

"Iâ€™ve had imaginary friends my entire life. Iâ€™m in my 20s now. As I got older, it became really elaborate with an alternate persona for myself to interact with my â€œfriends.â€ I get so caught up in it that I forget thatâ€™s not reality.

Iâ€™m on antipsychotics and have been for a while. Iâ€™ve tried bringing this up with counselors and maybe even my psychiatrist, but they just brush it off. I have trouble interacting with real people because I donâ€™t like not having control or not having the opportunity to redo conversations over and over again.

"My diagnosis is relatively new (about a year or so), but itâ€™s been a minute since the hypomanic episode that led up to my diagnosis. I used to romanticize that period in my life in my head.

But Iâ€™ve started to remind myself of the other days. The ones where I ruined years-long friendships over impulsive thrill-seeking. Wasted my savings. Ended up in the hospital. I embarrassed myself by posting the whole destructive episode all over social media. I was not a person that I want to be.
And now Iâ€™m just embarrassed.

"So, both my mother and I have been diagnosed with bipolar and have shown it since early childhood. Having a bipolar parent has had a very important impact on me, how I carry myself, how I treat others, how I interact with older adults. My mumâ€™s a great, caring, and genuinely kind-hearted person. Sheâ€™s supportive, responsible, and driven. But sheâ€™s also one of the meanest people Iâ€™ve ever met when she wants to be. Sheâ€™s a pathological liar, a manipulator when she wants information, and often times a hypocrite. I will say this: sheâ€™s been through hell and back in life and sheâ€™s managed to balance raising four kids all with their own problems, recovering from an abusive relationship that almost ruined her as a human being, severe chronic physical pain, a stressful career choice, all on top of being mentally ill and sheâ€™s never been hospitalized through her 50 years of life. The stress doesnâ€™t excuse it, but I can get how some of this can show itself as negative trauma reactions. Iâ€™ve watched her beat up neighbors, scare the hell out of people, and chase people down in bipolar rage all to protect me and my siblings. When sheâ€™s manic she paints every room in the house by herself and spends a lot of money on furniture. Which is a lot better than what I do when Iâ€™m manic so no judgment there. She also once spent $500 on candy crush and ripped down the bathroom wall with a hammer because she swore there was a leak.

"I am 25 years old and was a heavy drinker. For a long time I didnâ€™t want to admit I was an alcoholic. After much reflection I have never had a healthy relationship with alcohol. I started drinking when I was 18 years old and when I turned 20 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. By 20 I had been drinking and smoking weed every single day. Anyone who has taken mood stabilizers knows you are not supposed to drink or use a substance of any kind, but by 20 I was too far gone. I was taking my meds and still partaking in these substances. It wasnâ€™t until 4 months ago I had a really bad night and thought to myself â€œwhat if I just really never did this again?â€ This is the thought that will change my life forever. I am taking my meds sober for the first time ever and I canâ€™t even begin to describe the positive impact this has had in just 4 months. I have been promoted at my job, I no longer struggle with crippling anxiety, depression, or extreme bouts of mania. I feel extremely calm and level headed. I have been able to save thousands of dollars in such a short amount of time, which really helps me feel stable. Iâ€™ve even been back in therapy which is helping me heal from the embarrassment and destruction I have caused myself. I actually have goals in life again. I feel like Iâ€™m truly seeing color for the first time in my life. To anyone who is struggling with making this choice: it is WORTH it. Learn to be comfortable being uncomfortable. Sitting in silence just feeling the emotions you may be avoiding can be so healing. It took a while to get accustomed to my new lifestyle but it is so worth it.

"Today I had a discussion with my son (21) about Bipolar rage. I explained to him that being concerned about my triggers is not his job (or anyone else's), but when I am triggered, my medicine, and my therapy, can only do so much. I explained that when I am triggered, I have the possibility of becoming enraged, which could lead to violent behavior. (When I was younger and not medicated, I would physically fight anyone if provoked). I explained to him that there is no stopping Bipolar rage, it has to run its course and unfortunately,  the consequences (I have already gone over in my head- repeatedly over the years, along with my therapist and psychiatrist) will be something that a non-Bipolar person wouldnt understand.  We were going through a scenario, so i could better explain, and I informed him  that I would (more than likely) end up being violent in that kind of a situation. He looked at me and told me that I should be institutionalized if I feel like something, as little as words, would lead to violence. There's a whole process that happens before the violence. The disrespect that happened to provoke me to call that person out on their bullshit, and then the second wave of disrespect, that will more than likely happen once said person is called out, then the aggression from both sides, with high emotions, would possibly lead to violence. I let him know that I do not go out and look for a fight or any kind of trouble, but if it finds me, I am not one to let it slide. I really don't understand why there isn't more help for mental health disorders in 2022. I informed him that being Biploar isn't just mood swings, it's a disorder and it comes with many faces. I am trying so hard every day not to rage at people... I am usually exhausted after a few hours of being  out and about, not because I'm lazy or out of shape, but because I am constantly fighting a battle to ""behave"" in an orderly manner while I am out in public.

"Been single for about 5 years or so. Have not â€œgotten anyâ€ in two.5-ish years. Iâ€™m okay with being alone, I actually prefer it. But the loneliness is starting to really get me down.

So, like the genius I am I reactivated and updated a dating app profile. Have been talking with this person for about three weeks, have gone on two dates, and have enjoyed it so far. Now typically what happens is I keep the app activated for no more than a week and chicken out despite good conversations with people. So, three weeks is honestly astonishing to me. But, without fail my brain is finding every single reason why I should just cut things off and delete the app. The worst part is how really mean my brain is being about them. Likeâ€¦ripping them apart for hypothetical things. And that is just so awful of me and they donâ€™t deserve to be thought so little of. I even had to not speak with them for a day because the intrusive thoughts had me so conflicted about everything. Either itâ€™s going to work out with this person or itâ€™s not.

"Hi! I was diagnosed with Bipolar I a couple years ago. Since my diagnosis, Iâ€™ve gotten so much clarity in regards to my behavior over the last 10 years, itâ€™s really a relief because damn I was messy, and still am lol 

Iâ€™m now a HUGE advocate for those of us with bipolar, and like to spread as much accurate information as possible. With that being said, Iâ€™m a graphic design student and I have to write/design a book, and I chose to make it about what it means to be bipolar from the patientâ€™s perspective, but I need help. 

Iâ€™d like to include other peopleâ€™s stories and perspectives without having to make it up, but I want it to be witty/sarcastic. My idea was to get ratings, like Amazon reviews, of bipolar disorder. I donâ€™t want it to be clinical, I want it to be dark in a way that we find funny, that maybe other people find shocking. Or, if you want to go for completely dark and honest, do that! Something gritty and accurate to our experience, and how hard it is to manage day to day life that might come easier to others. 

If youâ€™re willing to participate and want to be featured, comment with a review out of 5 stars of your bipolar disorder/highs and lows/reactions to trauma etc. or even medication reviews. Just help me communicate what this is really like outside of what the public perceives it to be. 

Thank you guys. If this pops off the way I want it to, Iâ€™ll post it here first so you can all see how it came out. â¤ï¸",bipolar_disorder
"My gf has been needing space lately. It's been 3 days and we've talked but it hasn't been resolved. A lot happened to get to this point, I finally got a job where she is, then we realized it was going to be too expensive for me to break my lease, I had a break down. We both said things we shouldn't. But I don't think that negates our whole relationship as we've always been great together and always worked everything out together.

Has anybody had major side effects with long term use? 

I have read many stories about bone loss and dental health, that is the biggest thing holding me back from medicating. 

I don't know if other people worry about this, but I have dental PTSD after several bouts of dental trauma, so it's hard to weigh if the cure is worse than the disease.

"Greetings bipolar besties. Iâ€™m a 28F living in Colorado that was dx with bipolar 2 at 23, though Iâ€™ve had it longer than that (earliest severe depression episode at 12). I think I developed it due to genetics as my paternal aunt gets severe depressions but has had severe cut and dry manic episodes (ending up in jail one time) and her paternal grandfather, who was described as â€œhot or coldâ€ as he was super busy/active or catatonically depressed, ended his life in his 50-60s. Gotta love genetics sometimes, huh. The following is my seemingly endless list of my triggers: 
For Depression:
- too much sleep 
- not socializing/staying at inside too much 
- too much exposure to darkness 
- not taking care of myself or my home 
- prolonged moderate-severe anxiety 
- sad/frustrating/traumatic stuff. Just bad life happenings.  
- not positive on this but Jan-April is not my happy time. I live in a place with winters now so logically that would make sense if a. I wasnâ€™t in one of the sunniest states b. I didnâ€™t live practically next to the beach on the water in south Florida 20+ years of my life.
- Constant Alcohol/some drug use
- After a viral sickness (weird I know but look it up, its a known phenomenon) 
For Hypomania:
- happy events like new jobs or falling in love. Especially when itâ€™s more than 2 good things.  
- Lack of sleep 
- Fall- not all of fall but Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ve only gotten episodes from Aug-Dec. 
- traveling/different time zones 
- Some drugs like steroids and some med combos 
Mixed Episode:
- stress/busy schedule
- SSRIs 
- Some Med combos 
My funniest trigger though (to me at least) was when I was taking an overnight flight from Philadelphia to Dublin, the Irish guy next to me kept talking to me and wouldnâ€™t stfu, so I couldnâ€™t sleep the whole way there. He was nice and I think he liked me, but Im still on America time and need my sleep lol. Now to preface this, I have to let yâ€™all know that I am and always have been the queen of sleep. I literally can count on both hands of periods where I had difficulty sleeping. My problem is that even when Iâ€™m not depressed, throughout my whole life , I sleep a lot and need at the very LEAST 8.5hr to even function. I like to get 10 on a normal day and even then I need naps and I literally can fall asleep on concrete if I want. I also fall asleep with in seconds at night to the point I have no idea what time I went to bed and just describe it to others as passing out (which I recently found out is very telling of a sleep disorder due to how my brain developed, lol fr I need a brain transplant). Long story short â€”&gt; I need my 8.5+hrs or Iâ€™ll be a droggy zombie. So imagine my surprise when I got off the plane, I wasnâ€™t tired and I was ready to came/saw/conquer that day. Even the following morning (when I only got like 3hrs of sleep cause me and the hostel when bar hopping all night), I got up at the crack of dawn and did every experience I can fit in that day. It was weird cause I felt slightly tired deep deep down and was pretty loopy, but it was like I was wearing a coat of energy/excitement/Nirvana. To this day, Dublin is the best place Iâ€™ve traveled, out of the 100+ towns/cities/countries Iâ€™ve visited and stayed in and I recommend it to everybody. I think it was an objectively fun trip, however I do think it was mainly due to my goofy gal of a mood. I wish I caught that Irish boys name or remembered what he looked like cause I need to invoice him for the excessive/impulsive spending, condoms and cigarettes I used, and the extra meds I had to get on to bring me back to Earth.

"It might be social anxiety and paranoia. I love writing and singing and playing so much and itâ€™s always been very well received. I just have a lot of social anxiety when it comes to making real connections with people. I feel like people have taken it the wrong way? Like, in person itâ€™s different! But, online I suck at interacting with people. Iâ€™ve never made friends online, I find it so hard to do that.

Anyway, it seems petty I know but like I see they interact with me less online nowadays. Probably because at some point I didnâ€™t reciprocate. I feel like a socially inept ass. I genuinely want to make more artist friends because they seem like interesting people and Iâ€™d love to collaborate, but everything nowadays is done online and I just??? Like if I wasnâ€™t trying to pursue my shit Iâ€™d just not have social media probably lol

It doesnâ€™t help that shortly after a serious car accident in which I literally almost died I had a short hyper sexual episode. This one local dude started talking to me and it got sexual fast, but we never even met up. I kind of blew it and was mean to him for no reason because I had his suspicion that he was just playing with me. I apologized and we stopped talking and every now and then we briefly chat online, but we never really addressed anything.

Then, Iâ€™m a sincere attempt I started seeing a guy who he plays with sometimes. I genuinely liked this guy, a lot. He sort of just fucked me over repeatedly until I cut him off after some months of him maybe not purposely screwing with me, but still really hurting my feelings.

Iâ€™ve been incredibly stable after that short hyper sexual episode. Iâ€™ve never in my life been so stable and consistent in everything I do. Iâ€™m not hypomanic, and I still get depressed sometimes, but I truly am in the best place Iâ€™ve ever been in my entire life.

I feel like Iâ€™m stuck picking up pieces now and dealing with the consequences and it sucks.

I have a band now and thatâ€™s bringing me much more joy and purpose, but Iâ€™m so nervous to â€œnetworkâ€. Iâ€™m the leader, and Iâ€™m stepping up to the challenge of doing shit but fuck. Maybe itâ€™s growing pains.",bipolar_disorder

In the beginning days after I was overly medicated from the hospital, I couldn't even prepare my own meals in the microwave or complete the most basic of tasks. My doctor was bewildered by this and stated that he's never seen someone with such severe side effects. It was some of the worst months of my life and I felt truly terrible. Am I alone in this?

"Hi everyone,

I've had a bit of a rough year, it started off with my worst manic episode which ended in psychosis and sectioning and hospital but I managed to get back to baseline without becoming depressed. I had another manic episode in the summer, this one stressed induced which was thankfully mostly contained by lots of medication but it took a toll on me, to be completed honestly I haven't quite bounced back and for the past few weeks I feel like my anxiety has been getting worse and worse and it's causing my mood to dip. I'm so scared of becoming depressed because I've yet to have a depressive episode where I don't end up getting sectioned and hospital is so traumatic. My psychiatrist left a few months ago so I have nobody who knows me to talk to (my care co is on long term sick leave for the second time this year and they haven't issued a replacement and they also haven't given me a new named psych, just the duty one) I just feel so lost, alone, hopeless and scared.

"This is a bit of a combo post, I was diagnosed bipolar at age 13 but the doctor only really said it was because my father was and I was exhibiting some symptoms. She put me on Trileptal at 13 and I gained 50lbs from it which wrecked my teens. I was bitter and angry because it never effected my personality or my mind it only made me hate my body. 

Fast forward to when Iâ€™m in college 18/19 and Iâ€™m diagnosed again by a different doctor as bipolar. She put me on Lamictal which also I felt very little affects from. I had been on antidepressants since I was 13 and Iâ€™ve been on and off them since then, Iâ€™m now 30. I stopped taking Lamictal when I was about 25.

Currently, my relationship is suffering from my spells of self destruction, Iâ€™m paranoid and pushing him away with my behavior. Itâ€™s on itâ€™s last legs now and I just want to find some way to fix it. Iâ€™m not super impulsive in my actions but I do destroy my relationships when I get into whatever phase this may be (Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s manic or depressive, I mostly have experienced depressive in my journey since being diagnosed). 

Is there any medications that can be recommended that anyone has found success with that I can ask my doctor about? Iâ€™m currently not seeing one as I moved to a new state but Iâ€™m willing to get back in and try this again.

So last year I had weed induced psychosis (I believed I was Jesus) which landed me in the psych ward. I was put on Lithium and Envega Sustena and it ended the psychosis/mania. I was diagnosed as Bipolar 1.When I got out a while later I smoked again and ended up manic w delusions again. No meds were changed this time but the mania ended. After this I ended up crashing into horrible depression. Lasted months. Was hospitalized for suicidal ideation and my meds were changed to depakote/geodon. I was also given ECT. The ECT took me out of depression for a couple months. I started smoking again here and there but never had any more mania (maybe because of meds?). It did noticeably drop my mood once off though. Anyways a couple weeks ago I attempted suicide and was sent into psych ward. While in the psych ward my psychiatrist told me he doesnâ€™t think Iâ€™m Bipolar. He said he thinks itâ€™s an overdiagnosed fad and that HE thinks I have â€œsubstance induced mood disorderâ€. He took me off of all medication.

"Currently crashing after a two week hypomanic episode where I destroyed a friendship between myself and a close ex partner of mine, who I still hold feelings for. 

He just served a mandatory military service, which was part of why weâ€™d broken up. That and other reasons. According to him, he held on to his feelings for me for a while, until one day he woke up, and heâ€™d moved on. Me, however, I never got over him. Even after getting in other relationships. I never processed the ending of our relationship. He was my first real love, and the last good thing I had left in my life that i had before my life went bad due to trauma. 

I did the worst thing ever the moment he got out. I lovebombed him. I told him I never got over him. I begged him over and over again to take me back. I asked him to reconsider his feelings for me, his decision to move on. Multiple times he shot me down. I kept going. I was clearly not well. I also had other symptoms of hypomania â€” I wasnâ€™t sleeping for days on end, my record was about 4 nights in a row (I live in the US, heâ€™s in Asia, so staying up was my only way to talk to him), I didnâ€™t eat at all, I would go on speedy drives to â€œde-stress,â€ I blew up his phoneâ€” my mind went a million miles an hour. Iâ€™m only on Topamax right now, and I just started it. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve been on it long enough for it to be effective enough to prevent an episode. 

We kept fighting. Last night he asked me what happened this week, and I just was like, I donâ€™t know, maybe itâ€™s because Iâ€™m severely mentally fucking ill?! Oh the IRONY. But itâ€™s not an excuse. And I hate myself for it. And I hurt someone for it. Itâ€™s my fault. Itâ€™s all my fault. He has enough to worry about right now. 

Today I crashed. I know because I actually slept well last night. And when I woke up, everything hit me like a fucking semi-truck. How Iâ€™ve tormented this man for about two weeks now. How Iâ€™ve put myself through physical and emotional torture over my inability to move on. I actually slept. My hunger came back. I can think again. God, the depression is coming, I can feel it. Iâ€™m scared. This isnâ€™t going to end well for me. I feel miserable.

"Hello everyone! Iâ€™m new to this sub and I thought this would be a good place to ask for advice on how I could possibly help my mom. Sorry if itâ€™s not, Iâ€™ll take it down. A bit of context:

Growing up my mom was very violent and awful to me, to the point that when I turned 20 I escaped my home, I literally just left. (Weâ€™re hispanic and culturally itâ€™s pretty  normal to see a 20 year old son/daughter to still live with their parents) At the time I made the decision of leaving because of all the abuse I was already facing because of my mom but also her husband. 

Since I left I can only imagine this psychological abuse only kept getting worse. The husband is a narcissist and in a way wants to control her as much as he can. I firmly believe sheâ€™s dealing with some sort of domestic violence (not necessarily physical but clearly mentally and emotionally) As far as I know things were really bad for them (financially, housing, etc) to the point that she decided to visit her home country and family. While visiting her family, the day she landed she had a couple of drinks with one of her sisters and she lost her shit. She got violent with her sister. After all of this happened her sisters just thought it was the alcohol but still decided to take her to a therapist. 

My mom was reluctant to talk to the therapist, she treated the therapist horribly and at first she was diagnosed with PTSD. She was given medication but she refused to take it. 

Now a month later, still in her home country, my mom decided to look for â€œevidence of the witcheryâ€ in her sisterâ€™s home. My mom believes that doctors are stealing her energy and sheâ€™s being watched through her phone. (She emphasizes the stealing of energy and witchery a lot)  Since she made a mess in the process of trying to find said evidence, her sisters decided she should be hospitalized. Sadly my mom wasnâ€™t cooperating and she was taken to a clinic by force. 

While being in that clinic, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and she was medicated. She was there for 5 days and now sheâ€™s out. Sheâ€™s currently not wanting to take her medications and behaves really nasty and even intimidating to anyone who tells her she should take them. 

I am far from her and I will stay this way. I have my own anxiety and PTSD problems myself as to add more to my plate. Iâ€™ve had to do so much work to get better for myself and all of this hit me like a truck. I feel like Iâ€™m slowly taking steps back by trying to help her and I am not even sure Iâ€™m actually helping.  So I was wondering: 

What is something you wish your family had done when you couldnâ€™t see your problem? 

What helped you understand your problem?

"Stopped getting drunk, stopped partying and have taken my illness very seriously the last 3 1/2 years. Steady taking meds and doing regular group therapies and have full support from friends and family. When I become manic I don't realize it until it's too late and then I sabotage myself when I get depressed. (Ruin my personal possessions, physically hit myself, and absolutely degrade myself to the point I lay in bed for 4 days straight only to get up to use the bathroom. The embarrassment I feel after these depressive explosive episodes is like no other. I don't get any joy out of life anymore. ( My mom has my dog full time due to my living situation, I don't have sex anymore, I don't enjoy sports, I don't enjoy friends ) all I ever wanted in life was to be a father with a loving family and I don't even want that anymore. I am so very lost and not very intelligent which makes for things to be very confusing and hard to deal with. I don't even want to love myself, I just don't want to hate myself anymore.",bipolar_disorder
Wanted to feel less alone and ask if anyone else feels flat while being on meds? I feel like my psychiatrists just keep adding antipsychotics and Iâ€™m doing ect too but I feel so flat. It makes me feel suicidal. I miss the highs and the lows sometimes but I know Iâ€™m more stable now. This just isnâ€™t a way to live I hate feeling flat. I donâ€™t feel anything.,bipolar_disorder
"Journal Setup
- Get a three ring binder, a ream of paper, and three tabs to make distinct sections
- label first tab â€œPastâ€
- label second tab â€œCurrentâ€
- leave last tab unlabeled and put all the blank pages after this last tab

General Idea
- Only pull in pages to â€œCurrentâ€ from unlabeled as needed
- â€œCurrentâ€ is where you note all mental health concerns or other things you want to bring up in therapy
- After therapy session pull everything out of â€œCurrentâ€ and put in â€œPastâ€ section 
- Now no matter how shitty â€œCurrentâ€ was youâ€™ve discussed with therapist and start with clean slate.
- The â€œPastâ€ that youâ€™ve journaled is still there if helpful to review, but I keep focus on â€œCurrent.â€

My Therapy journaling procedure (for anyone interested in the nitty gritty details)
- take out page from last unlabeled tab and put it in â€œCurrentâ€
- daily or as often as works for you write in mental health concerns as they occur. Stressful things, things you arenâ€™t managing, things that you are guilty or ashamed about, things that are disruptive to your life, no problem is too big or too small for therapy
- Before therapy session take out a new blank page form third tab and title â€œReview Pageâ€ read through â€œCurrentâ€ section with a blank page beside you to take notes on things that you want to talk over with therapist. My therapist typically asks me about my mood in beginning of session so after reading through I usually have good sense of prevailing mood and emotions so I can note those as well.
- At start of session I open third tab and pull out a blank page where I write â€œTherapy Sessionâ€ and date. During session anything that my therapist and I decide I should try to work on is written here. 
- During therapy keep the â€œReview Pageâ€ in front of you to check off discussing or at least mentioning the things from â€œCurrentâ€ that you wanted to discuss.
- After session, I pull out all the pages from â€œCurrentâ€ by unsnapping binder and put them in â€œPastâ€ section.
- I put â€œReview Pageâ€ behind them in â€œPastâ€ as a nice summary of whatever that past was
- I turn binder open to third tab and pull out â€œTherapy Sessionâ€ and put it in the empty â€œCurrentâ€ section
- Every time I open to â€œCurrentâ€ I am reminded of things I wanted to work on or think over from last therapy session
- Repeat process forever

My thoughts about this journal technique
- it feels cathartic to me to take all the heavy things or if I am depressed probably no pages, and start after each session with a clean slate. Those things have been discussed and now Iâ€™m trying to focus on other ways to manage disruptions in my life. In other words, it feels really good to leave the past behind me. Itâ€™s still reachable but itâ€™s not staring at me.
- I feel like Iâ€™m writing my own life story. As more pages go to â€œPastâ€ itâ€™s like my therapist is my book editor and giving me advice on how to manage where things go badly so maybe â€œCurrentâ€ chapter shows improvement in small ways.
- I like the third tab unlabeled because even though I could call it â€œFutureâ€ that feels weird since the pages are always blank. But having lots of blank pages makes me feel hopeful like there is still a lot of time to get my story right, so that my life finally becomes what I want it to be.",bipolar_disorder
"Whenever I fall into a depressive episode I hate listening to music. Itâ€™s the number 1 indicator that Iâ€™m in for a true depressive episode rather than just feeling a little down. I will stop listening to music all together for a few weeks to months at a time. Iâ€™ll listen to podcasts and YouTube when I want to listen to something. I hate even favorite artists and songs.

"i just need to get this off my chest. about two months ago i was told i am bipolar. i had - what i know now are - manic episodes in the past, but this is the first time i can actively tell its happening. i have been hypomanic for the past couple of weeks and i am on the brink of a fluff blown manic episode. my roommate is aware that i am manic and i will be calling the local psych ward with their help on monday and getting myself committed asap, because i have absolutely wrecked my life during manic episodes in the past (for example - long story very short - i dropped out of school, moved 300km away into a different state to go to dietician school because i was convinced its my dream and started dating someone i just met because i was convinced they were the love of my life and wanted to start a life with them right after i turned 18).


and the worst part is i feel good. i feel fucking invincible right now. i feel ecstatic. and i am incredibly glad to have people in my life that are keeping me grounded enough to tell me that i am not doing okay and i need to go to the psych ward now while i am still somewhat able to make this decision because i do not think i would be able to do this alone right now",bipolar_disorder
"So a month ago I started seeing a psychiatrist and I was put on 100 mg Bupropion, 25 mg lamotrigine and Seroquel to sleep. I had a bit of a mental break down and stopped taking the lamotrigine the way it was prescribed(wasnâ€™t increasing my dose like Iâ€™m supposed to) 

Anyway, today I take 100mg Bupropion twice a day and 100 mg of lamotrigine and I feel a whole lot better. I was also prescribed recitalopram because my anxiety is so bad but I hated it instantly and sheâ€™s okay with me not taking it anymore

Soâ€¦I was never told what my diagnosis is. She didnâ€™t explicitly say Iâ€™m bipolar and or anything else for that matter. Does it take time for them to â€œofficiallyâ€ give it a label or am I overthinking it and Iâ€™m not bipolar? Thank you in advance",bipolar_disorder

"I was recently diagnosed with BP1 and looking back in my past I ca definitely see where I was in manic episodes but had no idea what was going on. During one episode I literally packed all my belongings in the spur of a moment and moved from NC to OR. I was on this high for over 7 months. Then it all came crashing down on me and I went into deep depression for a very long time. 
 
Iâ€™m still learning how to determine when I am in a manic state now. For medicines I am on Lamotrigine, Seroquil, and was recently put on Sertaline for depression. Lately I have been on this extreme anxiety phase where interactions with people give me extreme anxiety and I flee from the situation in such a embarrassing and rude way. I feel like I am not in control of myself at all. I do very risky things and after the fact I realize what I e done and then have panic attacks Because of my behavior. Beating myself up saying how stupid and embarrassing my reaction was to the point I am crying and wishing I could runaway or just die. Iâ€™ve always had social anxiety but never like this. Iâ€™ve talked with my psychiatrist and thatâ€™s when she put me on the sertaline. Iâ€™m so lost and know Iâ€™m on the downward spiral now. I have no friends, no family that understands. I want to get better but Iâ€™m just doing everything to prevent that from happening. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How can you recognize when you are in a manic state? Any suggestions for keeping self control during these times? I am so lonely in this.",bipolar_disorder
"When I was 18, I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 by a psychiatrist after I was admitted to the hospital for a hypomanic episode with psychosis (induced by sleep deprivation). Within 6 of that incident and I had tapered myself off the meds and I never went to see that psychiatrist again due to how traumatic the experience was. 
I went to see another psychiatrist from the same hospital again last year, in 2021, to seek help for depression and anxiety. 
It was at that meeting that I found out that my previous psychiatrist had diagnosed me with Bipolar 2 because she had never mentioned this diagnosis to me before, only asking about my experience taking the medication she had prescribed which were Sodium Valproate and Quetiapine. Ever since I found out about this diagnosis I disagreed with it as I never experienced a lucid enough hypomanic episode ever again, or at least not that I can remember and I thought maybe it is a misdiagnosis.
During this visit for depression and anxiety, I asked for anti-depressants. I was prescribed Fluoxetine and Lexotan, however, my new psychiatrist, cautious of the diagnosis in the previous psychiatrist records, also prescribed me Sodium Valproate to be taken with the fluoxetine. I also asked to be given Quetiapine just in case. 
I took the new medicines regularly before giving up within a few weeks and remaining unmedicated for the rest of the year.

Cut to now.
I am feeling very mentally unstable right now. For the past 1-2 months I have been in a cycle of extreme depression which were exacerbated by or the cause my disturbed sleep cycle. During this time I did not have any particular suicidal thoughts but just a profound feeling of the meaningless of life. I would just sleep non-stop and even forcing myself to sleep because I did not want to wake up and experience the depressed state of being awake. During a time like this I would say it's ok because I am not causing any harm to anyone because I'm just not there. 
The past month, I was feeling severely depressed and stressed due to looking for jobs and going for interviews, being rejected. I actually cried because of the stress which is something I hardly ever do. To stop the intense sadness I self-medicated by taking Quetiapine and Fluoxetine which I had leftover one time hoping to ""reset"" my emotions.
I'm experiencing severe anxiety to the point of a panic attack, and also sometimes fear and paranoia. When I go out I feel like people are staring at me. I feel very agitated by my mother and am easily triggered by anything she says which I feel is a slight to me. I feel also increased sensitivity where I think friends or people are pissed at me if I do not get a reply quickly when I message them. I also feel a more intense suicidal ideation where I really would like to end myself to stop the flood of anxiety that is overwhelming me. I'm not sure if this is an anxiety attack or hypomanic episode because on the one hand, I am not euphoric nor depressed, but I'm so agitated which I associate more with manic episodes rather than my states of depression. I have scheduled a visit to the psychiatrist with a public hospital but that appointment will be months away unless I do something stupid and end up in the psych ward. 
I would like some outside input on how to process what is happening to me now.",bipolar_disorder

I'm getting SO depressed right now especially because my mom is probably terminally ill and now I have completely and utterly lost faith in myself.  

Now I feel crazy for thinking I could handle this job, I just want something where I barely have to interact with people because I feel like I could break down crying any second. I have to like interact with kids for this job, and do lesson planning, and be really engaged intellectually, and I just feel like my brain is melting and I'm dying inside.

I feel so fucking embarrassed cause I told like everybody in the world how happy and excited I was about my new job and how great it is and now I just wanna quit super badly. And it WOULD be a great job if not for my own personal failings. And if I DO change jobs, what am I gonna do? Just like lie about it to people and pretend I'm still doing my other job? 

And I already like got off of Medicaid and onto this new insurance through my job so that's gonna be a whole fucking problem. I'm fucking stupid. The intrusive self-harm and suicidal thoughts are coming back and I don't think it's gonna work for me to be working around kids if I'm this unstable. 

My supervisor fucking caught me weeping in my office today due to something related to my mom, and it was when he was on his way in to my office to like talk to me about something I fucked up, something that I fucked up MORE times this week but he doesn't know about. And I'm like welllllll he's probably going to find out about those other times I fucked up, plus the lesson I taught my student today was fucking awful, I feel like she could probably like rat me out and they'd fire me on the spot.

"Repost from last night since i thought it over and settled down.

I am 21 and over the course of last year, i increasingly got back in touch with my old friends from high school. I left because of some assholes they have in their stupid group accused me of stealing alcohol at a DND session and told me my cry for help or mental status was personally hindering the group. They even told me to delete shit off my own snapchat story and been kept as a pushover. To clarify, all i was posting was asking for help or to talk because of my recovering mental issues. Literally nothing to do with them. I still hate them to my core.

It seems the toxicity has been rubbing off on my friends too. They have lost interest in me (our friendships are extremely one sided) and they talk behind my back, courtesy to an old friend telling me.

Literally nothing I do has made them budge. Even people from the college i go to and only have minutes of talking to, have helped me or even sent a reply back. Our group chats are abandoned and its of course mostly me using them.

There a whole shit ton of other BS they've done and this is the surface level of the entire situation. I dont give a fuck anymore.

Literally if there is a single person here who also thinks i should cut them off forever, please reply and you have no fucking doubt ill do it. It doesn't even hurt anymore.

"If I have to fill out one more safety plan I will lose it.

Any time I meet with a different therapist, receptionist, intake specialist and they ask about symptoms and I report suicidal ideation (even though 90% of the time Iâ€™m at the most a medium risk level for an attempt) we have to drop everything that was going to be worked on/said/asked

Now we have to do the same filling out of the same form with the same names and the same coping strategies and the same phone numbers to keep and all that

I understand theyâ€™re doing their jobs, even though-maybe itâ€™s cynical-this part of the job is probably mostly to keep them from getting sued

Either way I just feel like at this point the 15 or so minutes of my 30 minutes I get maybe once a month for mental healthcare is just wasted on this bull crap 

Not to mention I lose my health insurance in less than 5 months so I am on the fucking clock right now

At one point I told a former therapist I was close to just lying about or reporting reduced severity of symptoms just to save time

They always start talking about the safety plan the same way too: â€œI know youâ€™ve probably already done thisâ€¦â€

Iâ€™m not knocking Safety plans they are a good resource especially if you share them with your support team but filling them out over and over and over again and wasting time is only hurtful for everyone involved

"I'm used to mixed episodes. Normally, all my depressive symptoms occur with hypomanic symptoms. E.g. racing thoughts but I'd like to die; can't sleep or sleep but miserably fatigued; a sense of elated thinking paired with deep despair. They're seemingly contradictory symptoms and Googling the combos was the beginning of me accepting previous Bipolar diagnoses.

The past couple weeks, I'm having what feels like physical symptoms of depression with zero hypomanic symptoms. I could nap indefinitely, at many points in the day. (I have been napping once or twice each day.) I'm eating well (many small meals a day, which is normal for me). My mood is...eh. I'm not in despair, but I do have these moments where I feel as though I could cry at the drop of a hat. I'm sensitive, and occasionally sad, but often okay. 

There have been a couple life triggers. (One trigger was romantic, the other was career/life path related. This is usually the perfect recipe for one of my mixed states, yet here we are, sleeping.) I have had no changes to my meds.

At first I thought I was having an existential crisis. Then I thought I was pregnant (tested negative but I need to test again in a couple weeks anyways).

Has anyone had experiences with this?

"I've been researching this and it doesn't seem like anyone can agree. I've seen it be based on whether you have psychotic symptoms, how long it lasted, ""the severity"", the impact it's having on your life? Besides the psychosis, none of these are empirical lines that you can cross into mania. But you can be manic without psychosis, so what does that look like?

For example, people say ""severity"" or ""impairment,"" but what does that mean? Maybe someone is mildly manic but can control themselves from experience. Maybe someone is hypo and in denial but they haven't actually made any poor decisions yet. Maybe someone is not psychotic but their verging on it, or maybe someone is still sleeping but they're sleeping like crap, borderline not sleeping at all. It feels extremely vague and I don't love that a psychiatrist gets to interpret how ""severely"" I am being ""impaired.""

"(I'm a man in my mid 30s)

After years of suffering very annoying depressions that I chose to automedicate with drugs - triggering hypomania until drug used spiraled out of control and I would fall back into depression.

&amp;#x200B;

A few times, it was full blow mania, the latest was earlier this year, where *I particularly exagerated*.

Multiple drug use, all the time.

I bought two cars for my two managers. (One of them didn't have one, and the other just because)

I bought a washing machine but I already had one (also new).

Some portable computer screen but I don't need it. (I thought I did)

An Ipad, but I don't need it (it was supposedly to be the spotify ipad, used exclusively for that. wtf)

etc, etc, etc. I even negotiated 1 month GFE with a hot escort... (wtf why)

Had great times with this GFE escort. I was relatively generous, traveled to another country with her 1 week, restaurant almost every night, we had great time and we even cuddled a little bit.

But one day, she said I was *stingy* . That ended the manic. Back to reality. And then shortly after as I realized what the hell I had done.

This time I had exceeded myself financially.

It really made me think. So much, that I actually came to the conclusion that I didn't want to be ""crazy"" anymore. I wanted to feel normal.

And I knew, I always knew that there existed this ""lithium"" thing, but before I didn't want to lose the manias, so I kinda refused to consider it, trying instead drugs or antidepressants to get out of depression.

I started googling ""how lithium changed my life"" and similar words in order to understand this more.

I had been told in the past by each of my close friends, girlfriends, to consult a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but I always dismissed it.

But now, I knew I had never been so crazy before, and I kinda forgot I was crazy in the end this time, so I accepted that I needed to go to psychiatrist to tell him what's going on, and today I did.

He asked me ""why are you here?"" I replied ""I think I'm bipolar...""

He did what psychatrists do and then told me ""yes, you are clearly bipolar, no doubts about it"", and prescribed me valproex 500mg and some blood tests.

I have to take the pill twice a day and that it. All my life he said. I don't mind.

I expected lithium though.

I put a lot of faith in this treatment, I really want to live normally. I always wanted to be ""crazy"". I liked being a crazy motherfucker. And I did some crazy amazing things, many parts of my life were quite the adventures... but that's it. No more.

I haven't taken the first pill yet, and I already feel myself better.",bipolar_disorder

"I got my bipolar diagnosis after I had an intense mixed episode over last Christmas. At the time, it was very important to me that my diagnosis be Bipolar 2 and my care providers agreed.

However, I looked over the diagnostic criteria again and Iâ€™m starting to second-guess this. The main reason being that my mixed episode was severe enough for hospitalization. The diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5 specifically says that a manic episode is one thatâ€™s severe enough to warrant hospitalization and a hypo-manic episode is not. (Iâ€™m getting my masters degree in counseling psychology).

Beforehand, I thought mine was less severe because I self-hospitalized and therefore was still lucid enough to make that decision. Iâ€™m not so sure now and I wonder if Iâ€™m actually type 1. 

At the same time, I think bipolar is too complex to limit to two types (3 if you include cyclothymia).

I take Latuda for my bipolar. Itâ€™s helped me immensely. Iâ€™ve been stable for almost 2 years with no mania or depressive spells. 

However- Iâ€™ve gained 60 lbs. it sucks. I thought it was my thyroid (I have hypothyroidism) or my hormones were out of whack or PCOS symptoms. Been tested for everything- levels are great. It comes down to the Latuda. 

I saw a new endocrinologist yesterday who told me I was overeating (I track my food 1600 calories a day and do 30 min cardio a day - my weight doesnâ€™t budge). He told me to eat 800 calories a day (I cannot do this seems unhealthy) and to start taking phentermine. 

Iâ€™m worried that a stimulant might cause a manic episode. Iâ€™ve never taken one before and I am not sure I should risk it just for weight loss (I have a BMI of 37 so I do need to lose weight)

so last night i had a mutual friend come over to get their hair done. while getting his hair done with my partner and i both there weâ€™re all talking and then the friend asks â€œwould you ever be polygamousâ€

and my heart drops to my ass because iâ€™m in the middle of a really fucky mixed episode that has so far made me quit my last job, been very focused on vanity, too much rumination, etc.. yâ€™all know how it is. just self sabotaging.

my partner answers â€œnoâ€ and then our friend looks at me and i donâ€™t know if it was literally the worst thing to say or notâ€” but my genuine answer was â€œi think itâ€™s something to be talked aboutâ€
and he says okay and the conversation keeps pushing but i can feel the tension resonating off my partner telling me i fucked up. (iâ€™m definitely on the spectrum but high functioning, talking and socializing in an accepted way is weird for me and in general iâ€™ll be mute.) 

so after he leaves me and partner get into it really heated because theyâ€™re pressing me about what i meant and if i seriously want to be open.

 i word vomit essentially what adds up to â€œi know that at our current state in our relationship it wouldnâ€™t be an option (they have trust issues from past exâ€™s) and i never intended it to become a topic right now because iâ€™m fine with it and in the future when weâ€™re more stable i woulda brought it up properly and with my talking points ready.â€ 

and all that they heard was â€œyou wanna fuck other peopleâ€ as much as i tried to explain it from and indigenous and decolonized way of loving but in my current mental it just wouldnâ€™t come out right. the next day and we just got into it AGAIN and iâ€™m trying to explain thereâ€™s no reason to feel pressured to make me happy by agreeing and iâ€™m content with monogamy right now.

did i fuck it up entirely? my partner is convinced that the friend asked intrusive stuff but i interpreted it in general, as in with any partner. i donâ€™t know what is right and i even more so donâ€™t know what i really want. itâ€™s made me relapse SH and it sucks.",bipolar_disorder

"Which do you prefer and why? Is it something you even personally care about?

The gist I've gotten while I've been on this forum is that most neurodivergent/atypical folks prefer person-first language, but I don't know this to be true. 

I'm taking a general psychology class and they made a big deal about identity-first language ""allowing people to reclaim what others may see as a disability and incorporate it into their identify on their own terms"". However, there's been numerous instances in this reddit of people asserting person-first language to separate their identities from the disorder. Ex. ""I am not a bipolar person, I am a person with bipolar disorder.""

Personally, I prefer person-first language. I don't wear my bipolar diagnosis as a badge of shame, but I'm not proud of it either. Swap out the bipolar with depression and ""person with depression"" sounds a lot better than ""depressed person"" to me. Same with ""patient with cancer"" vs ""cancer patient"". Bipolar is a part of my identity and a major force in my life, but I don't believe it is my most defining trait. My good friends know about my diagnosis, but I'm not their ""bipolar friend"". I don't believe any of them would use bipolar or similar language to describe me if asked. I'm not trying to distance myself from the diagnosis because I think it's shameful, but I don't think it's an accurate description of me. Something about being called ""bipolar person"" doesn't sit right with me. 

Part of my feelings might stem from the feeling that I don't really identify with either bipolar camp. My symptoms most closely align with bipolar 2, but I experience psychosis and hallucinations, which I've been told puts me in the bipolar 1 camp. I don't really relate to the ""typical"" presentation of bipolar 1, but I experience things that aren't a common complaint for bipolar 2, so I'm somewhere in the middle and a very good example of why bipolar should probably just be considered a spectrum. This makes me feel like a bit of an outsider within my own disorder.

"â€œThere was a part of me that was alive and screaming, and she was scratching at the surface searching for a way out. Panicked, I cut open my chest to free her, but she stayed there, screaming at nothing.

I stare at the sky and watch the orange drip to blue, and I feel like I can breathe. Iâ€™m here, I exist. I feel it all, all at once. The world becomes a feather, and I float above the clouds. I float higher and higher until my fingertips touch the moon, lost in the weightlessness. Suddenly I start to choke, the air escaping my lungs as I fall back down. Crashing, burning, exploding into dust that disappears into the wind. So quickly, I am gone. The pieces of me that survived the fall slowly come together again, and then I am here. I exist.â€

This morning at work, we were reviewing each patient in our care and a nurse said: that daughter is crazy! She is severely bipolar.

Each of these little moments illustrates why I keep my diagnosis to myself! Both times, I  choked back tears. If they knew, they would think I am â€œcrazy,â€ too.

"Hi I'm a college sophomore, and for my whole life I've have issues with bad bipolar depressions and what I now realize is hypomania. My dad was diagnosed with bipolar along with many other things and took medication for a long time. My parents divorced because he stopped taking it and in a literal sense went crazy.

My mother now is beyond upset I'm struggling in college because of my bipolar. I recently have been diagnosed and after trying to figure it out on my own, I'm seeking help. I have a therapist, and now I have an appointment for a psychiatrist.

I'm having panic attacks, irritability, huge issues with my sleep, my mood fluctuating constantly, every symptom you can think of and my body is suffering. I'm getting huge sores on my scalp, and I can't find the motivation to eat. Having dreams where I wake up with bruises from my body trying to wake itself up. Just horrible dreams from nowhere for weeks now. I keep wanting to just stop being. Stop feeling, because now I can't control what I say. Or how my face looks when I'm in a conversation I don't want to be in. Lashing out at my friends over small things. I can't cover it up anymore. I'm always one small issue away from breaking down, and crying. It's affecting my studies so bad. Even more than last year, I thought it was the major so I changed that, but it's me.

Medication is a last resort. My family is disappointed in me, thinking they were right. I'm just crazy. I know this isn't my fault, but I feel that I could've done more to prevent it. I kept pushing it away. I was always the good kid, and then I broke in high-school. I was abused by my dad and my mom as a kid, and had my share of problems in life, but I didn't think it would still affect me at 19. 

I'm laying on the floor crying, and I feel like I'm watching my emotions act on their own through a screen. Like they are running things not me. Why am I not good enough to control my brain?",bipolar_disorder

"That's what I tell myself. My mood has been stable for years but now I'm getting signs that something is off. It's so frustrating because it's mild so I don't know what is going on. It's not consistent either which I've only had mixed episodes. I'm thankful it's mild but I don't want to be driving to work everyday about to cry forever so I need to do something. But then I question if it's really mild. I always minimize my symptoms. 

When it's like this, I tell myself it's all in my head. Like if I listen to happy music, I'll feel better. If I try to be more positive or accomplish something. Maybe it is all in my head. I hate feeling this way. And I know it could be so much worse so I don't want to make a big deal out of it. I can't get out of my head and stop thinking about it.

"So just needed to get this out somewhere because I feel like you're the only people who will understand.

So the past month I've been really well, new promotion at work, getting better at art, impulse dyed my hair for the first time and got this new cyberwar jumpsuit and have never been happier with my appearance. Been doing all the things, seeing all the peoples and just feeling fantastic.

Last Friday I went out clubbing with my boyfriend and our mutual friend, we went to three different clubs and then all came back to mine. He spent the night and it is honestly the happiest I've been for longer than I can remember. It was amazing, everything is going amazing, HE is amazing.

Then Sunday night I'm lying in bed and I just feel empty, I started getting stuck in my head and just couldn't muster a positive thought. Woke up feeling awful and didn't want to get out of bed, so I didn't and called in sick. I didn't leave the house for two days, I went back to work today and had dinner with my family. And the entire time I've just felt disconnected, not bad or good just empty and making what feels like the appropriate response to an interaction.

Literally everything is going great for probably the first time in my entire life and somehow all I want to do is lay in bed and cry, my throat hurts like I'm choking up and I feel so tired after just standing. I literally sat down waiting for a coffee today because I just felt exhausted.

Why now of all times, why can't I just get to enjoy everything that's going on. It's so unfair, I was doing so well nothing could have possibly caused this it's so shit. Anyway thanks for listening, hope you're all sticking to it I believe in you.",bipolar_disorder
"I'm trying to switch off Lamictol because it made me almost suicidal and almost relapse to self harm for the first time in 7 years (I resisted though!). Needless to say I was so depressed I genuinely considered checking myself into the hospital.

I can't fucking get into contact with my doctor. I sent her an email, I called her nurse, she told me to dial back on medication and she'll call me Monday. I had to call her, on Tuesday, and she asked if I'd be willing to try Wellbutrin because I seemed to respond well last time. Last time it was a supplement to Zoloft because I was suicidal after living on my own for the first time and being lonely, and I gave up on antidepressants because they didn't work and I ended up getting a partner (who I'm still with) and I didn't get lonely-depressed anymore. So no they didn't work, I gave up. So she said she would talk to the doctor again. That was on Tuesday. 

Out of frustration I decided to see if they would ever get in contact with me, and now I've fully weaned off the Lamictol but I still need help with my moods.

So I called them today, a week later, and left a voicemail like normal, usually they call back around 4pm but nope. Nothing.

I'm at the end of my rope. I like my psychologist as a person but the lack of communication is killing me, and there's no other psych close enough for me to go to.

Manic depression;

Constantly talking about it.
Constantly doubting everything around me. 
All the things around are constant, but me. 

I'm never consistent or sure.
Never secure or pure. 

Always scared or overthinking. 
This or that. Now or then. 

When do we stop
When does this stop 

There's no both. 
Just me and something I have. 

Why can't I understand and let it go?
Why does every song remind me of you? 

Like a lover and the heart-breaker 
Usually reviewing all the words we spat 

Except you don't talk
And I make up your words 

Because you are a part of me
Although I can't say we are one 

So when it starts
Aren't I the one to blame?

Till we see the story end.

"I want to know what you all think of this.

Abilify, Latuda, and Seroquel all gave me massive anxiety, obsessions/compulsions, and panic attacks. It was unbearable. Zyprexa, however, has helped with these issues. It has always puzzled me as to why.

I poured over the known mechanisms of action for all of these drugs, and they for the most part all do the same thing: D2 antagonism/5HT2A antagonism. Each drug varies a bit, but I did find one thing all 3 do that Zyprexa does not. Latuda, seroquel, and abilify are all 5HT1A agonists, while Zyprexa isn't. 

Counter intuitive, as that mechanism is supposed to relieve anxiety. However, it does do the opposite in some people. I don't know. Do you think I'm on the right track? I guess the only way to know for sure would be to take Buspar and see what happens.",bipolar_disorder

"Long story short, I havenâ€™t worked a steady job since October 2021. Itâ€™s because I was rapid cycling since then.
For work since then I had a babysitting gig a few times , some dog walkingâ€¦. Also a state park booth person for a month in august but quit because I was manic. 
Then things came to a head and I had a 14 day hold at the hospital. It was traumatizing but the one good thing they did was put me on lithium.
Because I started lithium they did a blood test. Turned out I had hypothyroidism all along. Explained a lot , including why I was so unstable.

Since then I have been very stable mentally and it feels great, like a relief. Life is boring and I love it. However I am still struggling with my thyroid , I am always fatigued and feel incredibly sick at times. 
Now Iâ€™m moving with my boyfriend to his hometown far away. Finally out of my parents house. Iâ€™m moving to where he is from , have a great living situation and will be meeting his friends and family . Heâ€™s paying for the trip and making it possible since I have little money(I do have some though). Now I have to consider going back to work, even if I feel bad with thyroid symptoms.(Thyroid meds take months to kick in). Living with my parents I could easily get away with not having a job. My boyfriend said he wants to take care of me financially but I donâ€™t want to be a burden on him. I also dont want anyone to think Iâ€™m using him or think Iâ€™m lazy or a bad girlfriend. Iâ€™ll be living near NYC and there is such an intense hustle and work culture. If I meet new people I donâ€™t want to say Iâ€™m unemployed. 

How the fuck do I prepare myself to go back to work after a year of being unemployed. I have nothing to put on my resume. I have so much anxiety around getting a job. I literally see people working and get anxiety bc I imagine being them in that moment . I have a mental block.

"Hi everyone, this is a question for those that are BPD type 2 hypomania.  

I was diagnosed earlier this year for BPD type 2 hypomania and started medications shortly after.  Originally started on ambilify and moved to lamotrigine.  Highest dosage of lamotrigine was 200mg which I absolutely hated, and now am at 100mg.  

One of my biggest frustrations is that I no longer feel like myself, and while I understand that thatâ€™s a side effect that can happen, I sure do miss the creative ability of myself before medication.  My creative imagination / ability to problem solve / come up with new ideas have dwindled immensely (were non existent @ 200mg).

Has anyone ever stopped taking their medication (with the approval and guidance of their doctor / psychiatrist) and self managed themselves when in a hypomanic state?  Are there other medications that I can try to bring back the creative aspects of my personality that I feel like Iâ€™ve lost since starting lamotrigine? 

Thanks everyone.",bipolar_disorder
"Hi everyone!

I (22F) want to start off by saying, by no means am I trying to self diagnose as I know how harmful this can be. I truly just want to see if I can relate to others in any way, as it would make things a bit clearer for me. 

So, I watched the Selena Gomez documentary the day it came out. As I was watching I found myself relating to her and her struggles with her mental health. After watching, I felt compelled to do a bunch of research. For a good majority of my life, my mental health has always been an issue. The best way I can describe it is exhausting really. I guess I never really realized it, but I feel as though I am always going ""up and down."" A part of me always thought it was normal to have these shifts though and it was just a part of life. I will have periods of depression where I struggle to even bathe regularly, keep up with my hygiene, have suicidal ideation, and lay in bed all day with essentially no strength to do anything as it takes too much energy out of me. Now, on the other side I will have very brief periods where I feel amazing. I will wake up with loads of energy and feel extremely motivated. I'll sing in the shower, dance around my room, blast music in the car and sing along. My self esteem is also in a much better places during these brief periods as well. A part of the reason I am making this post is because I feel like these brief periods I have aren't me acting super out of character though. I don't spend a lot of money (at least I don't think I do) and I don't really engage in ""risky"" behavior I would say. I am notoriously bad at explaining symptoms I experience so I apologize if this isn't really much to go off of. Also, as of the last year or so I have been experiencing derealization, which has been very scary for me to be completely honest. 

Also, a big reason I am seeking some clarity/advice is because I graduate nursing school in less than a month and my mental health is starting to make me think it will be hard to keep a nursing job. Right now, I can get away with laying in bed and doing nothing all day during my depressive episodes because I only work 2 times in a pay period at my current hospital and am obviously in school. I fear that when I start a job I'll really struggle and not be able to ""keep up"" during these periods. 

I also want to add that I do go to therapy! However, for some reason I am not fully transparent with her about my suicidal ideations, which I know I need to be and I plan on speaking about this with her tomorrow. Should I bring up bipolar disorder with her? What do you think? 

Any comments and insight is appreciated! :)",bipolar_disorder
"I (37f) was recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder after having a two-month-long manic episode. My oldest child almost died of a drug overdose and then my husband started an affair, and suddenly I was experiencing unexpected but welcome euphoria for a couple of weeks, followed by deep depression, extreme weight loss fueled by disordered eating, self-harming behaviors, and irrational/erratic responses. After a stay in the hospital, two weeks on Lamictal, and moving out of the house I shared with my husband, I am finally starting to heal and feel ""normal"" again.

Last night, I was in a store with my oldest child looking at jewelry and various gifts with positive messages when suddenly the feeling of euphoria returned with intensity. I felt it for about five minutes, basked in it, and then it faded away quickly. It reminded me that I have no control. I have no power over my bipolar disorder and it could return at any time. I feel like a ticking time bomb.

While in the throes of my mania, my children saw and heard me do things that were likely emotionally damaging, no matter how much my husband tried to protect them. I was trying to hurt myself and I consequently hurt them (emotionally). I feel immense guilt over that. I cannot do that again. How do I wrestle with this fear? I'm terrified of falling back into a depressive state. I never want to feel that way again. It feels like life is not worth living if this is going to happen to me again. Does anyone else feel that way? And how do you rationalize it or cope? I'm not feeling depressed right now, but I am feeling hopeless, lonely, and scared.

i moved back home after my internship. i am graduating with my bs in mechanical engineering in december. my parents offered for me to stay at home rent free, i just contribute to food and household chores. i'm currently job hunting; i've been on a few interviews so ill have something lined up after graduation. i don't really like living at home but its the best thing at the moment. i feel like a failure. doesn't sound terrible except, my dad is literally draining the life out of me. i have my good days and bad days as i'm unmedicated. i've been keeping busy by staying off of social media, exercising, reading, and going to social events once a week (i'm an introvert, once a week is enough, then i have to recharge my battery lol).

my dad works from home so any time he wants to vent he comes directly to me. i'll be in my zone doing my thing and he'll come in and just start complaining. he'll complain that he's unhappy in his life, that every time he tries to change his life he's still in the same situation, how he wants to go out and do more stuff but he can't because my mom is always pestering him, how my mom doesn't help out around the house (she cooks every now and then but she has rarely ever helped out around the house), etc. it's funny because he complains to us about my mom and how unhappy is but my mom never complains to us about him. that's not to say that she isn't also unhappy but that's just interesting to me. **i told him to talk to my mom about his frustrations. there's literally nothing i can do about any of this.** i suggested that he get individual therapy as well marriage therapy with my mom. he sounds depressed. its hard to go places with him because he complains all the time.

i honestly think he's cheating (again) because he keeps talking about this mystery business trip he's going on this week. he hasn't even told my mom because he's **afraid** to; he doesn't know how to tell her because 1) she's gonna wanna go too and he doesn't want her to, 2) if she does go she'll have to spend the whole time in the room alone and he's gonna be worried about her and 3) if she says she's going with him he just won't go. it all seems very suspicious to me and my siblings, we honestly think he's up to something.

i realize this is long but i'm so mentally and emotionally tired. i can't really stay anywhere else so i'm hustling to save some money  so i can move. i can't listen to him complain anymore. 

thanks for letting me vent, guys",bipolar_disorder

"6 years in a relationship. 6 years of undiagnosed cyclothymic BP. I always wondered why I would be super depressed and near suicidal for a few weeks then super ambitious for a few weeks with a high sex drive. 

During my periods of mania I would try to break up with my bf because I just needed to let it out, I wanted to have sex all the time. But when we would go through the conversation and basically break up, not one hour later Iâ€™m a wreck and running back to him because I knew it was a mistake. I tried open relationship convos and it just didnâ€™t work out because once we talked about it, I didnâ€™t want it.

Iâ€™ve been medicated for a few months now and feeling the most stable I ever have (which isnâ€™t super stable but way better than before). Iâ€™m now overly aware of when I shift btw mani and depression. 

I finally slept w 2 guys this weekend. I gave up on having a stable relationship, I canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™ll never be okay w monogamy, I donâ€™t think I can ever be stable with one person without my crazy sex drive getting in the way. 

We just broke up again, and we canâ€™t go back to how it was. Either the relationship has to change or we end it. Iâ€™m feeling really shitty and sad. I just want to be normal.

Anyone else feeling this way?",bipolar_disorder

This happens every year around this time. The time change has left me extra venerable.

Am I even going to post this? Will anything even change? I just don't know.

Sorry I'm taking up space. That's a dumb thing to apologize for but I'm genuinely sorry for it. I wish I didn't take up any space and could disappear quietly.

Iâ€™ve been trying to watch this one episode of my favorite show for three days. This has been happening for years. I really canâ€™t concentrate. I end up on my phone and scrolling through social media. I also have zero desire to watch new movies or tv shows or read any new books. I come home from work and I sit in silence for hours.

So like the title says Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ve been having a mixed episode for the past two weeks and itâ€™s just getting worse. Both the depressive symptoms and (hypo?)manic symptoms.

"Had 2 serious suicide attempts in 2 weeks ( was hospitalized for both). Second hospitalization they started me on extended release depakote because it's the ""gold standard"" for bipolar treatment. I'm not sure this was the right choice because I am already on vraylar and was not manic. I don't think depakote will help for the depressive parts of bipolar. I am supposed to take 1,000mg of extended release at night. So far, I've had nausea, GI upset ( I literally shit my pants today in the car ugh). I don't think I should stay on it.

"I have recently completed and received my results from my neuropsychological testing. I know that a lot of people with mental health concerns have considered it at one point and so I'll detail the whole process.

Before I found my testing location, it was really hard to get a hold of any places near me that took my insurance or worked with adult patients. What worked for me was calling my insurance company and having them recommend places that they knew would accept my insurance. 

I eventually found 3 places that worked with my insurance with various wait periods ranging from months to over a year. They also had various costs ranging from $800 to $3,000. After doing the intake process with one of these places, they told me they had an opening within the next two months which was great for me since I had already struggled to find a good testing place for over a year. The unfortunate part was that my insurance only covered half or so of the testing. On the day of testing **I paid $2,660.** Based off what I was told, **insurance will only cover what it deems medically necessary.** If you need this for academic accommodations, insurance will likely cover less, based on what I was told. I was able to save $600 by going to a fellow rather than the clinical psychologist. The fellow still had their work reviewed by the clinical psychologist.

Two weeks before testing, I met with the fellow who **went over my background, including family history, trauma and/or triggers, mental health history, current treatment,** et cetera. I personally found the pre-testing meeting very hard and emotionally draining despite it only lasting an hour.

The **testing lasted approximately 6 hours.** I went in as blind as possible so I wouldn't have any sort of preconceptions of what things I would be asked to do. I understand that others may want a better idea of the testing itself to ease any anxiety. The **actual date of testing was more cognitive ability focused.** I was asked to do many tasks focusing on academic skills such as math and writing. My memory was tested through recalling passages read to me or by drawing an object shown to me an hour earlier. I also had my abstract problem solving skills tested. Midway through the testing I was asked to fill out 3 or so questionnaire's focusing more on my mental health and symptoms or behaviors I experience. I felt the testing itself was better than the interview prior, but I still was very exhausted. **For those who have taken the SAT, imagine that but testing every possible thing that your brain is capable of**. I believe she also took note of my behavior during the testing since she pointed out some things I exhibited but I can't be sure.

Finally, I had my feedback meeting, which was about an hour long. **The first half of the result meeting went over my cognitive abilities** and where I scored percentile-wise. The fellow highlighted my strengths and urged me to use those in my daily life to improve my mental well being. I was also provided my IQ (in comparison to only those in my age group). 

**The last half of the feedback session was going over my mental health concerns.** The fellow started by going over mental or behavioral concerns (non diagnosis specific) such as low self esteem or feelings of guilt. Next, she went over what diagnosis's she felt best described what I experience. I felt that her findings were very accurate, even though the truth can sometimes be difficult to hear! To conclude, she gave some recommendations such as increasing therapy to weekly and maintaining medications, among other things. I would say this was stressful for me but was important.

**To wrap everything up. I would say that this was a beneficial experience.** I was able to identify some diagnoses that did not apply to me and identify some problems that are intense enough to be more than diagnosable. It also highlighted some of my strengths which might be able to aid in my work with my therapist. The main downsides were the emotional and mental exhaustion, cost, and struggle to find testing location.

Let me know if you have any questions and I hope this helps you if you are seeking neuropsychological testing. (Every testing location and testing person likely does things differently so unless you go to the exact same person I did things will vary!)",bipolar_disorder

Iâ€™ve recently been trying to picked up meditation as a way to keep me well during my little depressive episodes and I feel as itâ€™s been helping out a bit.

I think today just feels off, I was doing so well but suddenly suicidal thoughts come up for no damn reason! Thoughts of quitting my job and just leaving everything behind. I think I feel shame for feeling this way and Iâ€™ll find myself questioning if this is how I really feel.

"I (29F) got diagnosed with ADHD earlier this year. After increasing my Methylphenidate dose I got psychosis that turned into 2 months lasting mania.
One manic drug induced episode labelled me as bipolar. 
I doubt that, assuming I would restrain from drugs, I would get manic again. 
I was never hypo or manic before, only depressed which I assume was due to my untreated adhd. I guess I am looking for people who got drug induced mania only once and carried with their life like before without being medicated?",bipolar_disorder
"Anticonvulsants can't hold back psychosis, but antipsychotics will worsen depressive symptoms. Antidepressants cause mania which in turn causes psychosis, which is horrible and I wish to never experience again.

And on top of all that, my risperidone is making me sleep through most of class. It's making me feel empty and still. My skin is becoming horrible, no clue if that's a side effect and I honestly kind of don't wanna know. I just wish my brain worked normally without me having to drug myself. 

I have missed out on key life experiences because of this disorder. All throughout middle school I was too depressed to go out with friends, or to actually study anything, and starting from high school I started getting manic too. My life's a never ending cycle of picking things up and never going through with them. I never ever finish anything, not even a goddamn TV show or a book. Now it's college-applying season and I have no idea how to do anything and I feel as I'm not ready. Which is probably true: I'm not ready for life. To have a job. To pay bills. To have a boyfriend, to hang out with friends and party, all this I speak of is a life I dream of and will never be able to achieve. 

I know it's the risperidone acting up and making me depressed. I just wish there was treatment specifically for this disorder, because neither antidepressants nor antipsychotics are good for us on the long run, and anticonvulsants aren't even meant for us. We just found out it worked and rolled with it. I wish there was a ""bipolar drug"". I wish I didn't have these struggles that no abled person has ever had and that I honestly, truly, hope they will never have. I wish I never wanted to kill myself, I wish I never thought people were putting things in my food, I wish I had never seen things or thought things that weren't true. I wish my brain didn't hate me.",bipolar_disorder
"Hey, I finally got to see a psychiatrist last Wednesday (my area is so lacking in psychiatrists that I sent in my paperwork at the beginning of August). Anyway, she said that I definitely have bipolar disorder, though she's not certain as to which one. I planned on writing here the next day, but I started Seroquel Wednesday night, and basically didn't wake up fully until Friday afternoon.

I mean, I woke up Thursday long enough to see and pet my dog. But I felt super zombified the entire time. The zombified feeling stayed around every day a little less than the day before, and now I can wake up and get going in half an hour (or so). 

It's weird because I didn't realize how much emotional energy I was using to maintain a semblance of sanity until I didn't need to. The Seroquel is working and I feel more like myself than I have before. 

I do wonder what to do now. I am waiting for my body to finish adjusting to the Seroquel. But then what? I read up on bipolar disorder, and printed out a workbook. It discusses things like discovering early warning signs and creating a mood journal. Do people do that? And how does it work?

I guess I just wanted to tell people who will understand what I'm going through. Thank you for listening.",bipolar_disorder

They said there's a good chance that if insurance covers Vraylar that I'll be put on that, if not, Lithium is highly likely. I'm just happy because I haven't been stable at all literally all year and even after multiple ER visits and an inpatient stay this year, they still haven't found anything to keep me stable... but my psychiatrist has high hopes of me being on Vraylar or Lithium.

"I tend towards depression wayyyy more than mania, and it can last for months. In that time, I form habits of not really doing much, never wanting to go outside, and procrastinating self-care. Once I come out of a depression, my mental state is much better, but it feels like those habits linger. I still don't really want to go outside or do anything, and it's like I can only do one major task per day. It's so strange because I used to be very productive and social, and now I really don't mind just binging tv shows all the time and am not bothered to go work out or explore my city, or shop, or anything fun really.

"2 days ago my bf had an appointment with a new doctor because he wasn't feeling ok for some time.we always thought he had depression.I know what each med is for but never really paid attention to what he was taking.so after the appointment i asked him how it went and what did she say and stuff.he said she prescribed lithium.I was really shocked and told him : ""but doctors don't usually prescribe lithium for people with major depressive disorder!""he said whatever and we moved on.since i take lithium too, he said he will buy his later and take some of mine for now but didn't know the dosage.I checked his prescription and saw that he was also prescribed lamotrigine=)))) this time i was like something is wrong here=) turns out he's been taking lamotrigine for the past 2 years now:))))))) and I didn't notice:)))) so i said if you're taking these two you must be bipolar too(I have bipolar II) and he's like no i'm not I'm just depressed.i made him ask his doctor what her diagnosis was and she said he's on the bipolar spectrum.I'm still shocked after 3 days because he never shown any signs of being bipolar.btw his previous doctor had prescribed lamotrigine too.so yeah I'm really confused",bipolar_disorder
"And I feel so defeated. I was really trying, and my bosses told me they thought my heart wasn't in it and I had given up. It's so frustrating because that isn't the case at all. In spite of being depressed and having such a hard time focusing, I was doing my best and powering through. I wish I was normal. 


The real kicker is that I was supposed to get back on medication is September, but my appointment kept getting pushed and now I won't be able to see my psyche until the end of December... I feel like I may have stood a chance if I was medicated in a timely manner.


Anyway, I didn't really know where else to vent where I could possibly be understood. This hurts so bad, I don't want to spiral, I felt as though I was finally doing ok.",bipolar_disorder

But after she spoke to my psychiatrist, all he's done is increase my quetiapine from 300mg to 400mg and has said ""not to worry about the sleep"" and they'll check on me after a week to see if the increase has helped.

"I've had my psychiatrist since I was diagnosed in 2017 and she's gotten progressively worse. She rushes appointments, with my last appointment being less than 5 minutes long. Not only that, she has consistently joined these telehealth appointments *at least* 5 - 10 minutes late. Paying over $100 for 5 minutes of her time is infuriating.

I wanted to switch my prescriptions to Cost Plus Drugs because of how expensive my meds can get ($150 per 3 month supply because my insurance wouldn't allow less than 3 months vs $32) and she had the gall to get frustrated with me because it took like 10 minutes to do the initial sign up. Before I could ask her to send my Rx to them again, she ended the appointment and sent it to CVS. 

I've also had issues with my weight thanks to Seroquel and the pandemic, which she points out at every appointment in a condescending way rather than a concerned way. Seroquel has made it INCREDIBLY hard to lose weight and my self esteem has tanked because of it. During the last appointment, she told me to get bariatric surgery even though my weight isn't at the point where it's necessary AND I just had another invasive surgery earlier this year which I had a difficult time recovering from. Rather than being in shape, I'm a bit chubby, but this honestly just hurt me to the core.

After they cooled on me, even though I'm the person that pulls everyone in the family together, I feel liberated but still lost. After they decided not to observe my birthday (but offered a simple cash gift), it made sense to just cut them off seeing how low they really viewed me. Meanwhile, they went all out for multiple people's birthdays just before mine. 

Anyone have any advice or similar experiences? I'm new to Reddit's mental health boards and could really use some insights from similar people. During the event, I deleted my Instagram even though I was already distanced from people.",bipolar_disorder

While manic I held two relationships (not at the same time) and looking back I wonder how I even did that. I also wonder if those people even met the real me. Why did they enjoy me in that state? Makes me question a lot. 

*off topic but can I just add that the memory loss from this illness is one of the hardest parts

"Hello. I just recently got prescribed two medications: Depakote (Divalproex) ER 500mg pills before bedtime and 100mg of Seroquel (Quetiapine) to help me sleep.

The thing is, I donâ€™t like how they make me feel. The frontal region of my brain feels retarded now actually and Iâ€™m not experiencing much, if any, feelings of pleasure. 

For context, I was taken to an inpatient program after my mom became worried about me when I got really drunk one night and skipped my meds while I was already seeing another psychiatrist and taking Zoloft, Latuda, and Trazodone. The psychiatrist at the inpatient facility scrapped the previous docâ€™s plan because he wanted to see how I would respond to bipolar medication.

As I mentioned though, I am not a fan. However, I have not been able to get into contact with either psychiatrist about switching or stopping medication.

Iâ€™ve taken the 1000mg of Depakote ER and 100mg of Seroquel for seven days now; four days last week (Tues.-Fri.), skipped Saturday and Sunday, and three days this week so far.

But I was wondering: Can I just stop taking this weird mind numbing shit right now since itâ€™s still so early? Iâ€™m not in danger or suicidal or anything like that and have zero health conditions, I was just struggling with a bout of anxiety, depression, and insomnia as well as a tendency to binge on the weekend (Iâ€™m a senior in college).

My blood pressure was high enough earlier (About an hour ago) that I called EMSA. They came by and did a few more readings and determined that I was probably okay, as within the course of a few minutes. (Just took it again, we're looking at 151/85 with a rate of 110)

With the changing of the seasons, the two major life changes I had recently, the excitement of getting into a study program I've anticipated for a long time, and the stress that I'm under, I'm worried that any one of these or a combination of them may be a trigger for mania for me.

"Hey guys! I am 19 years old and currently attending university, I was diagnosed with depression at 15, and bipolar when I was 18. I was taking medication during my 2nd semester of school and I was doing so well! I felt energized, and I was working part-time while being a full-time student, all while maintaining a stable relationship with myself and my emotions. I decided to stop taking them because I felt I was ready and capable of managing my emotions a lot better and in a sense my bipolar. 

But, that was not the case. As soon as school ended and summer started, it seems as if everything caught up with me and I entered one of the worst depression states ever. I did not go outside, cut all my friends off, cried almost every day, and just sat there doing nothing. I felt that maybe if I just tried hard enough I could overcome it. This was the summer before I transferred to a good university in my state and I felt I needed to be prepared, but I just couldnâ€™t get myself out of that state.

As school started, I tried so fucking hard. I tried to get up early morning, go on a run, eat a good breakfast, study, read, and meet people; I just tried so hard to be *normal.* But it felt as if God laughed in the face of my struggles because it did not matter. It did not matter how hard I studied, I failed and had to drop 2 classes, dropping me to part-time. I had to switch my major and give up on this dream I had to become a psychiatrist. It did not matter how much I put myself out there, I felt ostracized and insecure, resulting in me being stuck in such a lively city, feeling isolated. It did not matter how much I read, I feel no smarter. It just did not matter.

I have a plan, I want to continue school, but I feel terrified of myself. I can't trust myself to just wake up and be consistence in life. I feel like I failed at life the moment I was born, what did I do to deserve bipolar? Why can I just have a normal brain? I just hate these emotions and thoughts always pushing me until I fail over and over again. I just want to know I can find some peace in my own absurdity. I just don't want to hate myself. I want to succeed, and have friends and lovers, but am I allowed to have this life with bipolar? I can't shake this feeling of my life was already decided for me, I am almost a victim to myself.

"If the title sounds like a clickbait tabloid article, good.

Hereâ€™s what I know: when Iâ€™m depressed, tiktok is a soft comforting glowing screen of entertainment to distract me from myself. When Iâ€™m hypomanic, tiktok lets me lie in bed all day, racking up dopamine hits in a way that bothers nobody and keeps my bank account safe. It brings me slightly up from depression and brings me down off my hypomania, turning me into useless, mushy state of nothingness.

When I experience hypomania I do not experience any kind of ego inflating symptoms. I do not feel extraordinarily smart, attractive, or funny. I donâ€™t feel on top of the world or like nothing can stop me. Instead, I primarily feel anxiety, paranoia, and delusional. It can be fairly terrifying at times.

At first in video games and then in real life. When it got to real life I knew it was a bigger problem. Would wait for my rides from work and see somebody watching me out of the corner of my eye

 Nothing I couldn't console myself about though. But today at work I kept hearing my coworkers say really derisive things that didn't make sense. They'd been so kind to me this entire time.

Then my boss and my supervisor were talking to me about filling up the mop bucket, and I noticed that I couldn't understand their faces, and instead I got this really terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach, as if they were scowling at me horribly. And then I shut down and had a panic attack that stopped me in my tracks. Had to explain to my boss what was going on. I felt like a complete fuck up. Went home after that.

The worst thing that seems to happen with me is when people hurt me emotionally I get vengeful and want to hurt them. Only to realize not only would that be morally wrong, but Iâ€™m often incapable of causing them the same levels/type of pain they made me feel. 


So I find myself in these situations where I continually dwell on the pain the person caused me it get consumed with the idea retaliation.

"Hello all. I recently got prescribed Seroquel and diagnosed as bipolar. I haven't much felt a difference in terms of mood quite yet, as it's only been a few weeks, but I had some strange side effects that I was wondering if any of you have ever experienced.

First off, and most embarrassingly, I have almost no libido at all. Even if I want to have sex or masturbate, I find it to be almost a battle, where just a few weeks ago the smallest thought would have me ready to go. I was definitely a once a day man, and now I've only masturbated once in three weeks, and my body didn't even really want to do that. It's like it's taken all of my testosterone away.

Secondly, and MUCH harder to explain: I take the pills at night right before bed, and for about the last fifteen, twenty minutes I'm awake, my brain is absolutely filled with nonsense. It's like someone is opening thousands of random one second mp3 files all at once, and one right after another. It's all completely random and has no continuity or pattern, and it doesn't seem to be coming from any specific place. It's all just noise, and it drives me absolutely insane. Most of it sounds like my own voice, like my own inner monologue, but some of it is people's voices I've maybe heard on tv or something like that. It's really bizarre, and I'm hoping that it goes away as I get more time with the drug under my belt.

"Iâ€™m not by any means trying to self diagnose. In fact i never thought I had bipolar. It just seems too far fetched - or maybe also because of the portrait of bipolar in mainstream media and movies etc makes me feel like i donâ€™t really have bipolar. 

I already got diagnosed with major depressive disorder (chronic, usually nothing triggers my episodes) and ADHD combination type primarily inattentive

Basically ive been a high functioning wreck for as long as i could remember. I was not really a happy child and my adolescent years i was miserable. So when i got my adhd diagnosis i feek like its explained a lot of my symptoms - being territorial with my belongings, throwing tantrums and fits if plans get altered or cancelled,periods of reckleckness and unnecessarily risky behaviours, hyper focus and at the same time not being able to to focus on doing whatâ€™s important

My antidepressants prozac worked for 4 years, i was on 40mg a day. Until one day it stopped working. But even when it was working i was just feeling numb a lot of the time and periods of reckless behaviours still happen consistently. 

Honestly i doubt i have it but i just want to see what mania really feels like with those who are already diagnosed? I dont want to leave any stones unturned. 

I have a habit of overworking myself and taking on a lot of projects and also socialising, going out a lot, always end up consuming so much drugs and alcohol, stacking up credit card debt, detailed planning of career change (say i watch a murder show and plan to quit my job to be a detective), very difficult distinguishing or telling what is real and what is not. Like my thoughts when im feeling this buzz are real but when the depressive episode hits me i look back and be like wtf was i thinking. I barely sleep when im feeling hyper too. 2 hours a day give or take. The feeling of being invincible feels so strong and real that when im like this i think im being completely within sense and rational. While people around me think im losing my mind. Last week i spent over 1k on random shits i dont even need at 6am cause i was pacing and couldnt sleep. 

My depressive episodes are the worse. I got hospitalised twice for suicide already. Most recent time was 4 months ago. When im depressed i dont eat i dont get out of bed i even pee in bed cause i cant be arsed to go to the toilet. Id say the frequency where i alternate between being hyper and being depressed is probably around every 3-6 weeks? Although there were a few occasions where my depressive episodes lasted for like a whole 5 months. 

Do you think these might just be severe adhd symptoms?
Should i seek another psychiatric evaluation?

"i was going through my first depressive episode, which started when i was like eleven, when i finally got psychiatric help, at sixteen. my psychiatrist was an idiot, a complete dumbass. he treated like a child, belittled my problems and blamed it on being on puberty. he completely ignored the fact that i had mood swings, not only depressions, and put me on an antidepressant whichâ€™s name i canâ€™t remember.

and then i got stupid energetic and frenetic. my adhd worsened to the point i stopped being able to sit down and study without having a fit. i used to be the best student, and downgraded to someone who was barely mentally present in class. i became so irritable, something so uncharacteristic on me, i didnâ€™t feel like myself. that smae irritation drove me to speaking up against my psychiatrist and demanding a new one.

this new one, guy who actually knows what heâ€™s doing, took that antidepressant away from me and put me on lamotrigine. and things are so much better now. i feel like when i was a child again, so honestly happy, no lies and no filters. iâ€™m hipomaniac now, and things are so much easier than before. i get much less sad, much less angry, and much more happy. i still get my moments, but i donâ€™t feel hopelessly lost. still a long way to go, but iâ€™ve improved a lot.

i canâ€™t blame it all on my old psychiatrist, but he did screw me over a bit. he got me somewhat out of my depression, but created a deep hate and terror of dchool in me. but oh well, life goes on",bipolar_disorder
"i started feeling off a few days ago. i'm moving out of my parent's house and it's a really last minute thing so i've been so overwhelmed since the beginning of the month, especially since i had to decline a job offer i was really excited about because of this move. so im guessing that's why im having this shift in mood.

i also stopped taking meds. idk what made me quit besides me just not caring about taking it anymore. i simply just don't want to even though i know it could help me. i wasn't on anything besides 50mg of zoloft which was way too low for me anyways :/ i was supposed to pick up an abilify prescription 3 months ago and still haven't.

psychiatrists haven't been very helpful. my new one prescribed me a bunch of pills and sent me off with no follow ups. i wasn't aware of my bipolar until recently so i have no idea how to handle any of my episodes. i was told to document them but wtf do i do when it actually happens??? i've been feeling like i'm on an insane amount of caffeine since i woke up, even embarrassed myself again today by going on deranged overly personal rants on my instagram story. the worst of it has been the shaking and the cold sweats. my voice breaks as if i'm about to cry because my teeth are chattering and i can't get words out properly because of it. everything i say keeps getting so jumbled because my brain is moving faster than my mouth can.

my boyfriend lives with me, but is gonna be spending a month or two with his parents bc there's so much stuff we need to do before the move. so this is my first time sleeping alone in bed in a while, and i've been so paranoid at night. because of all the boxes in my room i keep hearing something shuffling around between them and i convince myself something is hiding there. i can't sleep until i turn the lights on and play some boring long youtube video to distract myself.

"Hi so I have diagnosed bipolar spectrum disorder and I have a lot of trouble consolidating my emotions with my reactions to situations. Often my reaction is blown way out of proportion to what's actually happening. Mood stabilizers and therapy have helped greatly but sometimes situations like these happen and I'm confused as to whether it's okay for me to react this way or not. Some advice would be awesome. 

Anyway so me and my gf (who knows I'm bp) were playing a game that involved taking turns. The turns are something you can control the length of, it's not like ""until you beat a level"". I took about 10 minutes on mine, with her helping me, and then she took her turn and refused any help, even telling me to stop talking. After 25 minutes I was really frustrated with just watching her quietly and decided to watch a YouTube video while she finished her turn. I started watching one on the PC and she yelled at me for ruining her recommended videos with what I was watching, while physically lying on top of me so I couldn't click on my video. I got up and told her ""I'm genuinely pissed off"" (those words exactly) and walked to the bedroom to cool down on the bed. After about 3 minutes she walked in with our cat and they started to play on the bed on top of me, then she laid on me and tried to kiss me and I told her no. I got up and said ""I'm going out. You didn't do anything wrong but I'm really angry so I'm leaving for a while."" She was like ""...ok"" and I left the flat. I'm scared I maybe have upset her so I'm just going to turn my phone off for a while and maybe go to a movie and then come home. Did I fuck up really badly I'm scared, maybe I should have stayed home I don't want to ruin anything or make her worried :((

It has been a year since you came into my life and started messing things up for me. I donâ€™t love you, and I donâ€™t want you, but I am starting to accept that you are part of my life now. 

In the beginning, you were the driver that spun the car of my life careening out of control, but with help, you are now just an unruly passenger. I will not let you take control over me again. I have domesticated you. You are not the boss of me anymore. I will tame you with the unquenchable fire that burns within my soul. 

I am lessening your symptoms with my medications and coping skills. I know you will never go away, but you need to know that I am the one in charge now. If you try to take over, I will beat you down time after time. I am stronger than you.

"hiii I (F21) was diagnosed with BP1 and suffer from hallucinations and delusions almost daily and iâ€™ve had violent manic and depressive episodes since age 12. I have a great therapist who referred me to a psychologist and once i met her she basically told me i would not be able to accomplish any of my life goals until i got my bipolar symptoms treated with medication and that really terrified me. I donâ€™t like the idea of meds and she started me on Lithium 300 mg then doubling the dose after 5 days. After 3 days on lithium i felt an extreme urge to self harm after years off being clean from cutting. My depressive thoughts have never been worse and she also told me there was no way i could smoke weed as lithium does not go well with it. Also said weed makes bipolar people worse, I use weed with discipline and mainly  for my insomnia and PTSD from abusive childhood and relationships as well as SA. Weed really helped me but i followed her instructions and when taking the lithium i completely stopped smoking as well which brought on panic attacks daily since it helped soothe my anxiety. I want to live a good life without meds and i do want to quit weed as well, but i think that is more of a psychotherapy issue that is not related to my bipolar diagnosis.If you or anyone you know can tell me that i CAN get better without meds and feeling like a guinea  pig until they get it right.

I take Vraylar at 3mg and Wellbutrin at 150 once a day. The level of anxiety I've been having is bananas, at least compared to what it usually is on meds. Don't know what to do. Maybe they've stopped working? Maybe they just haven't fully reincororporated back into my system? Maybe I'm hypomanic? Not sure but I hate this. Idk if I'm venting or asking for advice. I guess both.

"Can you experience bipolar manias without any euphoria, but only an anxious and aggressive hyperactive restlessness urge to take action to the thing triggering an ""episode""? I mean, can you even call it an episode if the agitation and arousal only happens with certain triggers?

I suspect my doctor thinks I'm bipolar because she refuses to give me SSRI for my general anxiety. I have described getting very intensely hyper and starting a lot of processes, like analytic writing, researching and contacting relevant people to solve the problem that triggers the state. By this she claims that giving me serotonin might increase this ""high"". But she hasn't asked about any other symptoms. I don't feel euphoric, rather I feel helpless and desperate, I won't describe myself as grandiose but I do have an overall feeling that a lot of people I have asked for help have been incompetent. This opinion is pretty stable.

"Hello, I'm not entirely sure how relevant this is to bipolar but these have been my experiences and I am Bipolar type 2; I'm looking for any advice, words of re-assurance, any related experiences, and I also just want to rant a little, so here goes.

So I'm in a relationship after 5 years of being single, I started therapy and medication this year and have been making an effort to find some normalcy in my life, and actually take steps to build a life, as I've probably spent every year since highschool in the same place (mentally and physically). My experience with them has been good so far, but I can't help but find myself filled with a lot of doubt, I worry that it can't work out because of who I am, I obsessively look for any reason to think things aren't going to work out. I also find myself feeling very guilty, from the outside I'm a very functional human being, but my partner has no idea I'm bipolar and I'm afraid to tell them, and afraid they'll find out anyway if I don't. I also worry that I may come off as obsessive or smother them with too much affection, because really I am obsessed and it has taken a lot of effort to try and maintain a healthy amount of interaction with them without pushing things too hard. On the other hand I could make myself too distant trying to temper myself, It's hard to find a balance when you're already off-balance and have no idea where balance is. I really want to believe that good things can happen to me but there is this ingrained feeling of dread and hopelessness from years of literally doing nothing but struggling to hold on to jobs and living out of my parents basement, I know that sounds very defeated but really it is the truth, It's hard to challenge those thoughts when you've lived with them for so long.

"The short of it, the last 3 weeks have been a rollercoaster of emotions where they are hot/cold/hot/cold with me and there break was so sudden and they even admit it came out of nowhere...anyway they have been having sex with people and 5 days ago they gagged at me for flirting, that's when we went on a break with no contact. Well downloaded tinder to find a cuddle buddy (just friends and I stated that) as soon as I made it got a txt from them telling me I'm pathetic and never wanted them only attention. They said I'm funny for thinking we will get back together.. despite everything I love them and will always be here for them and fight for them. They've been very depressed recently and I'm just wondering what to expect with mood stabilizers? There in them now and before this our relationship was amazing and happy and joyful this was a 180 on me ...what should expect and do? What I've learned I've learned through social media because they never blocked me. I've been a constant in there life the entire year and one month we have been together we have had our ups and downs and plan to stay in there life even if it's just friends. love them and even on our last day of contact they told me they loved me. During these 3 weeks I've been told they will never leave me, they want me to move in, they want kids with me still, they love me and that if they didn't want me they'd leave already. A week ago stayed with them due to a heart break they had and we cuddled, slept in the same bed,showered together and they'd grab my hand and hold it or grab my hand and put it on there inner thigh. So what should I expect? I've gotten a lot of advice about our relationship and like I've decided that even if we won't be together still always be here for them if they let me.. what can I do to help them?

"My family member, let's call them Alex, was diagnosed bipolar around 2012 after being admitted to the mental hospital for several days following a manic episode. They've been on lithium for years. 
Two years ago Alex had a manic episode that I personally witnessed and they were in the behavioral unit for a week before they finally started coming out of it. 
Just recently I found out that Alex stopped taking lithium along with their prescribed sleeping pills and other medications because they're 'doing better now' 
The reason I found this out is because I was with Alex a few days ago and they were acting really strange, giving me signs that they may be going into a manic episode. 
I asked them if they were taking their medicine, and they informed me that their doctor took them off all medications and even said that he thought Alex was misdiagnosed bipolar...but that is simply not true. 
Yesterday Alex and I were in the car together and Alex saw a plane and was convinced it wasn't moving (it was an optical illusion). They immediately started panicked and saying things that didn't make sense. 
Ever since this Alex has been constantly saying things out of nowhere that don't make sense. I know where this is going, I'm just scared we won't be able to get them back on medication in time without sending them to the mental hospital.
I also don't know if Alex would agree to admit themselves at this time. I'm extremely stressed about this. All advice requested.",bipolar_disorder

Iâ€™d learned to establish a bubbly auto-pilot so people couldnâ€™t tell when I was depressed or hypomanic (for the latter, Iâ€™d say I drank too much redbull). I struggled so much during those years. I put everything into my work while also trying my hardest to stay out of the hospital. One of my former supervisors still thinks I have a heart condition to this day. I never said it but my mom called out for me &amp; told her I was on the cardiac unit (which I wasâ€¦after an overdose during a mixed episode before I was transferred to psych). I never corrected her. 

I spent the first few years of my career feeling like an imposter, especially the time I spent working inpatient psych. â€œIâ€™m so fucked up myself, how am I supposed to help anyone?â€ 

I won employee of the quarter of the whole hospital alongside one other social worker. After years of struggling, Iâ€™m finally okay. Iâ€™ve been on the same med regimen for a couple years now &amp; Iâ€™m doing well. Dare I say, Iâ€™m even happy?

"Iâ€™m diagnosed with bipolar 1. Anyways, Iâ€™ve been dissociating everyday for about a month now. I dissociate but it wasnâ€™t as frequent as it is now. I started off with depersonalization while driving and feeling like my body wasnâ€™t my own but like a child took over my body while I was driving. This would go on to happen like once a week and cause me to have panic attacks while driving. Then when I would look in the mirror, I would feel like my face wasnâ€™t my own so again I would get scared and start crying. These last for a few minutes then they go away. Weeks after these happened, I started dissociating more than usual. I would be doing normal things but it was like I was out of my body watching me do things. A couple of days ago, I was so dissociated that nothing felt real. I was walking around Walmart with tunnel vision, if that makes sense. My eyes feel weird when I dissociate, almost like it gets blurry and my brain feels mushy. Anyways I talked to my therapist and we canâ€™t figure out why im dissociating more than usual and she said itâ€™s severe because I couldnâ€™t remember little things. When I started dissociating more, I noticed my depression symptoms also coming back after 2 months of being stable. Iâ€™ve been more paranoid than usual.

"My grandparents have recently significantly declined. Both have dementia. One is in more of a vegetative state, never says more than maybe three words, is largely non-responsive, but otherwise seems to be in fair health. The other one is in great physical shape, is very active, but is completely detached from reality. Doesn't know who anyone is, has a short term memory span of a pigeon, and is very angry and agitated most of the time with violent outbursts (lashes out physically at nurses). Both are in nursing facilities.


The decline of my grandparents has taken a huge toll on everyone in my family. Before we got them into facilities, my relatives were taking turns ""babysitting"" them, until things got too extreme to handle on our own.

Now, both grandparents are in safe, disgustingly expensive, five-star communities with 24/7 care. Yet, still, my relatives have this fixation that they need to go up there and visit them 24/7, bring them food even though they receive four square meals a day and snacks from their respective facilities, bring them toiletries (this is understandable because the nursing homes don't provide these items, but why can't they just buy a bulk pack of toothpaste and Depends and be done with it for a few months?), etc.

I have gone with my mom on a few of these visits to the nursing homes, and they are never enjoyable, or even pleasant. My mom and relatives seem to enjoy visiting with them, I guess because they are their parents, even though neither grandma nor grandpa is coherent, or even nice to any of us (dementia aggression/anxiety).

My grandparents have been in these homes for a few months now. They are finally adjusting, and my mother's brothers and sisters are starting to relax and prioritize their own lives again. My aunts and uncles rarely visit anymore, I can't recall them going up there once in the past two weeks, and they have been socializing and doing fun things with their children (my cousins), etc. Things are...well...kinda getting back to normal!

Except for at my house.

My mom is still OBSESSED with thinking she needs to be the 24hr caretaker, even though over 10k+ is being paid out every month for each of my grandparents' facilities. 

My mom and I used to be best friends. Also, we live together. We talked about everything, traveled together, went out to eat and drove cool places just for the heck of it. Now, it's like she's completely abandoned our relationship. She cannot move on from the fact that my grandparents are on the decline and are not going to get better. Instead of accepting that and let the nurses take care of things, she is always scheming about ways to help, and puts our lives totally on the backburner. Every weekend or free moment during the week she devotes to driving up to the old folks homes. I try suggesting we go out to eat or to a movie, and she always declines. Worse, many times I have to accompany her on these visits, when I am drained from work and just want to relax. 

My mother also claims it's ""immoral"" to not visit them. I don't understand this concept at all. Granted, I never felt close to my grandparents. My relatives have hideous stories about how they are narcissists and abused them growing up. Grandma and grandpa were just there, and at Christmas they gave me a gift or two. So no, I don't feel any real connection to them. When we visit them, they are mean to my mother and other family members. They are disrespectful and don't appreciate any of my mom's efforts. She falls through her ass for them, they don't event remember if she visited because they have no sense of time, and when they do remember they insult her and tell her she can't do anything right. It's like my mom is still jumping through hoops trying to win their approval, even now that they are no longer mentally competent and are actively dying.

My feelings and mental health are hurt because my mom doesn't seem to care about me anymore. We went from being lifelong best friends to now I am an afterthought. I feel ignored and neglected, and when I express these feelings to her she acts like I am selfish. Maybe I am, but I really don't care what happens to my grandparents, infact, I almost look forward to their death so that my mom will pay attention to me again.

"Hi All,

I have ADHD, Pure OCD, and Bipolar 2 as actively diagnosed disorders but I'm currently on medication for BP2 as the mood-disorder is the goal to handle for my psychiatrist with the hope that treating that will help make tackling ADHD and OCD more manageable.

So I'm going to jump into it with this reality of mine that is driving me mad.

I have been a reaaaally deep depressive episode pretty much since May. I have had many many moments where I ""got my sh*t"" together for a few days or so before crashing and falling back into deep depression. I can't keep my room clean, I've been sleeping with a bunch of dirty and clean (although definitely also dirty now) laundry on my bed for weeks. I have junk lying around that I just don't know how to clean up. I get stuck sleeping all day and staying up at night to avoid my roommates, I've even peed in a bottle on multiple occassions, just with the intention of avoiding them. (I know that sounds like severe social anxiety, but it exclusively manifests in my depressive episodes).

I know I need help and am currently working with my psychiatrist to seek in-network therapists, but it's been slow.

But I have also experienced what I can only describe as ultra-rapid-cycling contained within my lower state of depression. Just 3 days ago, I was in an amazing mood, I was hanging out with my roommates, I helped them clean the apartment and was socially active and inspired, my room was half clean, barring the laundry still on my bed. All I had to do is finish that laundry and I feel like I would've felt better for longer. I didn't do it and the very next day the mess accumulated and grew and I just started dropping things on the floor to the point that I had to cautiously step to avoid the sound of plastic bags crinkling as I walked at night. My sleep schedule has flipped on it's head and I stay up all night. I woke up today at 10AM and told myself I'd get out of bed and get started cleaning. I fell back asleep while getting ultra absorbed in this really really dark mental fantasy of really screwed up stuff (lot's of Pure OCD intrusive thinking, just awful things I would never do but in the moment I couldn't stop thinking about, and then beating myself up for it.) Rinse and repeat until 3PM.

I realized I had been in my room effectively all day, my roommates were audibly out and about in the living room so I just feel too freaked out and ashamed to leave my room. I need to shower, I need to eat food, I need to use the bathroom and brush my teeth. And I just feel a complete mental wall block me everytime I walk towards my door to leave my room, I can't face the fact that I'm so low. My roommates don't really know what I put myself through and I'm not close with them, but we're cool with each other. I just want to be invisible and not deal with the potential of the ""Oh wow dude, I didn't even know you were home."" comments, which I seemingly always get from them when I'm in these really low phases.

But the thing is, almost once every week or two, I have a few days where I get it together. Sometimes a week straight. I start showering, I fix my sleep schedule, I work out again, I stop ordering takeout and start cooking my own food. My room is spotless again and literally everything in my space is organized. I feel set-up to actually function.

I feel like I'm on top of the world, a blatant sense of ""I've figured it out and I'm going to be okay"". I'm incredibly social and active and engaged and willing to focus on what I really need to be happy. And always, after a few days or maybe a week of that, I PLUMMET deep back into the crazyland that is this depression. 

It's like hypomania without the momentum that turns it into a much more fulfilling and productive phase of life; much, much shorter and more tame compared to my months-long hypomanic episodes. A short blip on the radar where I feel like I've taken control of my most serious issues and have set the groundwork to stave off this empty dark world where I dig myself deep into a hole of nothingness. But I struggle immensely to maintain it even for a few days. I don't even know what my ""baseline"" is anymore because I just flip back and forth nearly once a week, I just feel like there's this neverending chaos dragging me along for the ride and I can't find stable footing no matter where I go.

The month of May was easily the darkest point in my life, just completely off the rails. I never left my room, never talked to people, never showed, never ate at all or over-ate junk food, never cleaned, never slept on a schedule, over-slept or didn't sleep at all, and peed in water bottles to avoid my roommates all day, only coming out at night to take care of myself. But goddamn at least it was consistent. I knew I needed serious and immediate help and after years of watching my mental health slowly bring me to that point, I found the motivation for the first time to seek out psychiatric help. 

My psychiatrist put me on Lamictal and I've been titrating for the past couple of months and am on 100mg a day (would have been more but I went through a phase where I didn't contact my psychiatrist for a bit and just kept refilling the dose of 75mg daily for 6 weeks.)

I just don't know what to do anymore. I thought I was going to solely reach out to see if people related to the intense rapid cycling part, but I think I need some serious help and even just someone to talk to because not a soul knows the real severity of my mental state and I feel like on the surface I appear to be a completely happy, functioning, successful, productive, and active 23 year old. I seem to have no issue maintaining that appearance, like seriously nobody would guess except for the few close friends I've talked to about it, but they also don't know that this has been an enduring state of mind for 5 months.

"First time posting here
22 F

I was diagnosed with bipolar during a mental hospital visit around 1.5 years ago. 
Iâ€™m not sure if my diagnosis is accurate.. I say this because I was in a 2 year long emotionally abusive relationship before\during being diagnosed. Itâ€™s triggering to type out too much detail, but I was gaslit every single day until I genuinely began to feel and act crazy. About 6 months before I went to the hospital I started anxiety meds and mood stabilizers because my reactions to the abuse was becoming violent towards myself. I was afraid to tell the doctors why I was hurting myself so I didnâ€™t tell them much about WHY it was happening.. I kinda just made up excuses. Telling them my extreme reactions were at small everyday challenges and normal things he would do. I was hiding the abuse because I was in denial.

Now that I have been out of that situation for more than a year, I am starting to believe that I do not actually have bipolar disorder. I have been on medicine for over 2 years now and I feel like they are making my life worse. I believe they are causing me to be depressed and irritable. I want to try life without them. I want to see if I am able to have normal reactions and states of mind by myself.

One thing that really scares me about antipsychotics and mood stabilizers is the unknown\unspoken long term effects. I have a friend that worked at a inpatient care home for the elderly.. and she says the ones that have been on them for their whole lives have a lot of brain and behavioral issues. So of course that is a factor into my possible decision to stop my meds.

I would like to mention that I have never been evaluated by a psychologist. My diagnosis was an emergency medicine diagnosis given at a hospital. I am thinking of getting this done, but only off my meds. So i can have a true representation of my natural mental state.",bipolar_disorder

"To preface this I stopped taking meds back in February. I used to be on lamictal, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, and adderall.

I just started taking my Wellbutrin again because itâ€™s getting to that point.

I broke up with my boyfriend in December and I kind of went into a hyper sexual episode. I moved back home, totaled my car on the highway and by a sheer miracle I didnâ€™t ðŸ’€.

Eventually I moved in with a coworker 5 minutes from work and things seemed to be better. Despite everything even now I have a good grip on my mental health, but Iâ€™ve beginning to spiral into depression this month.

I was in a toxic on and off relationship with someone I unfortunately developed strong feelings for and lowkey still do. I cut him off once and for all early this month.

He wreaked havoc on my self esteem, but I knew I could bounce back.

A week later I learned than my workplace is shutting down in November and last week I was diagnosed with genital herpes. Iâ€™ve had about 5 sexual partners since my breakup and irresponsibly hadnâ€™t been tested since January.

Iâ€™ve only ever had protected sex, but with herpes thatâ€™s not a guarantee.

I texted this last dude telling him to get checked. He thanked me for telling him and took the news somewhat suspiciously well. I donâ€™t want to play the blame game, because it doesnâ€™t matter anymore. He texted me his morning saying he came back negative, so I guess I might as well take his word for it. Heâ€™d mentioned prior that he hadnâ€™t been intimate with anyone before me in years and I believe him.

I feel terrible, embarrassed, defeated, my heart is completely shattered. I recently started therapy and on Tuesday Iâ€™ll share the news with my therapist.

I had pledge celibacy after this guy just because I was so hurt by him. Now, I feel like Iâ€™ve been forced to close myself off. I fee unlovable and at least before I felt fuckable. I love sex so much, even to an unhealthy degree because it became a means to feel validated.

Through this pain I find myself longing for him again, badly. Because in his own fucked up way he cared, he just couldnâ€™t be who I needed. Heâ€™s cruel and manipulative, but I feel so attached still.

I canâ€™t go back because he was awful to me, but now I donâ€™t even think heâ€™d even want me back since I have herpes.

Iâ€™ve cried a few times, maybe not enough. I think if this happened any earlier in my life I wouldnâ€™t be able to handle it. Iâ€™ve got a grip still, my feelings donâ€™t feel as sharp, but I feel like Iâ€™m being swallowed whole.

"My daughter (27) is manic right now. Sheâ€™s still taking her medication but atm itâ€™s not enough. A lot has happened recently, and sheâ€™s being extremely impulsive. She lives over 3 hours away, and I just started a new job. 


She had to have a D&amp;C so she was told to take two weeks off of work. While driving to visit family, she hit a coyote. It messed up her bumper. 


She decided she needed three weeks for self-care. Sheâ€™s lied to family members about what weâ€™ve advised her. (Of course we all compare notes and screenshot texts.) Weâ€™re worried sheâ€™ll lose her job. When sheâ€™s not manic sheâ€™s wonderful, and right now she could be working from home. 


Part of her self- determined self-care is going to visit her former roommate (that she complained about constantly) in Boston. (My family, including my daughter) lives in Mississippi. So last minute flight from a small airport. $$$


She bought a new car. Her old car was not anywhere close to totaled and insurance covered the repairs. She only had a year left to pay. She lied to all of us about different car things and what each of us advised. 


Her hair was waist length. She decided to SHAVE HER HEAD, but my youngest child convinced her just to cut it short. Itâ€™s now a bob. Itâ€™s cute, but this isnâ€™t her normal behavior. 


Sheâ€™s buying expensive things. Everything she feels is a medical emergency. 


Is there anyway to help her right now? Sheâ€™s not threatening self-harm so we canâ€™t get her into a hospital. We donâ€™t know anything to do to stop her and maybe get her on some medication to get her back to normal.",bipolar_disorder

"Hey I(21) diagnosed wit ADHD at 17. A dear friend of mine(22) just got diagnosed with Type 2 Bipolar yesterday.  She was in depression for few years. I thought she got out because she was brilliant last couple of weeks. Energetic, confident, lively. She was just like me when i'm not in depression. She had a couple problems with focusing, impulsive behavior and sleeping but I thought she has adhd too but didn't comment on it. 

I kinda messed up by telling her how much she healed and she is beautiful, charming and overall perfect rn. The thought of hypomania didn't even cross my mind. (btw we are both doctors in training) 

I think i harmed her and don't know what to do at this point.

"When I'm manic, the ideas just flow. Some of my ideas are good, some are even great, and some are outright garbage. 

When I was in college, the moment had arrived to write my thesis statement for my senior thesis paper. The statement was due the next day, and I still hadn't thought about what I was going to write about. It just so happens I was manic. It also happens I was taking a British literature course, and we were reading Beowulf. 

Now, my favorite philosophical topic was and still is epistemology, which is the study of knowledge. What is knowledge? How do we know what we know? Topics of that nature. So, you'd think I would have been researching something with an epistemological theme. 

Nope. In my manic frenzy, ideas about Beowulf started flowing. I was reading paper after paper about Beowulf versus reading philosophy papers. 

Then, I stumbled across an older paper, where the author had argued that Beowulf wasn't a hero. I recalled some virtue epistemology that I had read, and I made a loosely formed argument in my head that Beowulf was a hero, because he learned how to be one throughout the course of the text AND he acted like one. 

I must have had a touch of manic grandiosity to boot, because I probably wouldn't have had the confidence to pull off a topic like that, for my senior thesis of all things, that would seem so irrelevant to the field of philosophy. But the words practicallly typed themselves on the page, and I submitted the document. 

During class the following day, we presented our thesis statements. Mine was met with mixed reactions from the professor. On one hand, it was certainly unique. Original. On the other hand, there was the possibility that there wouldn't be enough philosophical merit to the paper down the line; that it would be a piece of literary criticism and not a philosophy paper. 

My professor was pleased with my progress on my senior thesis with each passing class. As more time went on, I was able to incorporate a stronger philosophical backbone to the paper. Eventually, the time came to present our senior thesis via a public lecture. I presented it, and my public speaking was surprisingly eloquent, at least for me. When the floor was open for discussion, she admitted that she had her doubts, but she stated that she was impressed with the philosophy I put behind the paper. 

I earned an 'A' for the presentation and an 'A' overall in the class.",bipolar_disorder
"I have been on what seems like every antidepressant, mood stabilizer and antipsychotic on the market.

Now I take abilify, trileptal, cymbalta (which I am now tapering off of and replacing it with trintellix) and lamictal. I can't help but feel guilt and shame for gaining so much weight. I have never been skinny but now I am morbidly obese and so uncomfortable with my appearance that sometimes I struggle to leave the house.

33 M. Well after flying too high hypomanic for months the bipolar finally swung back low again about a month ago. I think I'm as depressed as I've ever been right now.

"My mom and I were talking during our car ride home about my relationship with my step dad. To summarize, my step dad and I are both intellectuals, and he's always around to listen whenever I ask him for advice. However, I don't feel particularly close with my step dad, as he has his own emotional barriers up due to his own negative life experiences. 

Anyway, this discussion led my mom to remind me of how my step dad had advised me years ago not to major in philosophy. My step dad told me I'd struggle to find a good job with a degree in that. He was right, but I digress. 

During college, I met my now ex-boyfriend, who ended up being abusive to me later on down the line. After college, I had trouble finding a ""real"" job, so I worked at a call center, booking hotel rooms for people. I loathed that job. My ex suggested that I find a job where he was living. I ended up finding an entry level position at a residential foster care facility for adolescent girls. So, I packed my things and moved out of my mom's house and into my ex's mom's basement with him. 

The foster care job was exceedingly difficult. You see things you can never unsee. You hear about things you can never unhear. You're constantly picking up pieces that someone else left behind. Sometimes, that job was physically demanding. But, most of the time, it was mentally and emotionally taxing. 

However, at the end of the day, I did genuinely like that job. I think that's the only job I can say that about. 

My position was only entry-level. I wasn't cut out for management, and, if I wanted to move up any further without being a shift supervisor, I would have had to further my education. Barriers kept getting in the way. First, my bipolar reared its ugly head. I was out of commission doing a partial hospital program for about a month. After that, I faced financial barriers. I had racked up a lot of debt during past manic episodes, and going back to school wasn't in the cards at that time. A little while later when I was more financially secure, my ex had started being abusive to me, and he was firmly against me furthering my education. 

Today, I am still trying to get a better handle on my bipolar. Plus, there's a good possibility I now have PTSD from the trauma my ex put me through. So, I think it's safe to say that I missed my shot at working in the social work field. Even though my bipolar is getting to a better place and should be close enough soon, there's the trauma issue. I got triggered at my last job, because a man screamed and banged on things over a TV not working right. I'm just too sensitive now to handle the injustices and traumas that social work would bring. 

Maybe if I had never gotten with my ex, I somehow would have found my way in a social work position anyway. Maybe then, I wouldn't have had as many stressors to trigger my bipolar, and thus would have been mentally and financially prepared for school. Of course, it's just useless speculation.",bipolar_disorder

"So I've been having migraines looking back for years I've been ignoring even after a good friend kept insisting I get them checked out.   Well recently they have gotten really bad as in a 5-6 on the pain scale every day spiking to 7-8. I have called my doctor's office who set up an appointment for the 26th of this month.  They then called me on the 8th and set up an appointment for the after hours clinic on the 9th. where the doctor was like basically well I don't know, do neck stretches use Flonase (eventhough I had no scenes symptoms) get a sinus and head CT, when they get bad try these and a prescription for Imitrex for treating migraines.   

Well I've taken the imitrex several times now it really helps not cure them.  Well past Thursday my migraine hit a ten for the first time, I could not function.   I was in the ER for 5 hours dad repeatedly seeking help (as they are allowing one guest again) and finally getting them to take my vitals again which netted me the next room.   I literally (In the actual dictionary definition)  spent the whole time dubbed over and shaking and moaning in pain eyes clamped shut clutching my head trying to block the light coming through my sunglasses as it was still too bright.   They literally brought me a wheel chair and I needed help because if I'd not be caught I would have collapsed to the floor 3 times.  The nurse had to help me to the bed out of my shirt  (tee shirt) and into the hospital gown before I pretty much collapsed onto the bed lights off where I was eyes clamped shut moaning.   Then a nurse came and put an IV in. normally that would be really freaky to me.   I was so out of it I'd I'd not registered.   I was given a drip plus 3 medications.  Also got a head CT there.  The CT came back normal and was diagnosed as a sever migraine.

The ER treatment helped but did not cure them.   Fast forward to today I left work and hour and 20 minutes early because of the pain, it would normally take an act of god to get me to leave work early (it was a 7).  I took a 2 and a half hour nap to get some relief.  Still hurts like an SOB still feel like I could puke up anything I eat.

Yet she keeps acting like it is your normal run of the mill headache..

It teeps triggering because both my parents treat my bipolar like it's just a simple your sad lately just snap out of it, oh your happy that's good.   And I've given up trying to give them anything educational on it as they won't even read anything. 

It just makes me feel like they think I'm faking everything and I'm just blowing everything out of proportion.   It feels so belittling.

I don't know what to do to make her see this is not just some normal headache (I mean most people don't like to play make-believe for well over 5 hours for just your run of the mill headache). Not most people spend years and tens of thousands of dollars and two hospital stays playing make-believe that they have a serious mental illness.

"Iâ€™ve been back and forth with various doctors and specialists for a few years as I severely struggle with various symptoms daily. Iâ€™m almost certain I have either bipolar, adhd or a combination of both, but I canâ€™t get any professional to hear me out. They simply donâ€™t care. 

I will put my main symptoms below but I think it could be bipolar due to the changes in mood but then I think it can be adhd as Iâ€™ve had some of the related symptoms since a young age and there was never an explanation for my behaviour. 

Some of my symptoms are:

Current or ongoing

* Either majorly motivated and productive or severely depressed/no desire to do anything and thereâ€™s never an In between 
* Preferring walking over public transport due to impatience 
* Struggle to watch new movies/tv shows
* Hyper fixations (taking up hobbies/starting business where I get super invested then all of a sudden drop interest)
* I find it really difficult to do things I want to do (I could want to draw but canâ€™t physically bring myself to do it)
* Iâ€™m actually super organised (I love writing lists etc) but thatâ€™s about as far as it goes as it then gets overwhelming 
* Energy bursts
* Dissociation 
* Struggling with my identity and not truly understanding myself - getting confused about what my own personality is as I feel it changes a lot 
* Constant racing thoughts - jumping from one to another almost like I have 100000 tabs open in my mind
* Impulsive behaviour and habits - overspending mainly 
* Work best in a quiet and calm environment with warm lighting - I can be sensitive to loud noise
* Misplacing items and memory blanks often
* Restless legs, fidgety hands and feet - needing to get up and move a lot even though I am an active person
* Constant sleep issues - either oversleeping/insomnia/waking up consistently
* Misjudge time - often run late which has really affected me in many ways
* Sometimes feels like Iâ€™ve physically got an engine running in my mind and body 
* I struggle with severe health anxiety/hypochondria

Some things that were extremely present in my teens and as a child:

* Being super disruptive and inappropriate in school
* Not sitting still
* Focused on subjects I enjoyed like English creative or personal writing
* Quick temper
* Anger outbursts and temper tantrums
* Fixations on specific things - watching one thing or reading the same book over and over etc

This is some among many symptoms I experience in day to day life and I have just always felt different to those around me. I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I know itâ€™s more than that and I guess I just want confirmation so I can have the appropriate treatment. I have been on antidepressants for 2 years and whilst it slightly stabilises my anxiety I do still struggle a lot maybe even more with a lot of the symptoms.

Can anyone offer some advice on what to say to my GP or where I can go for a diagnosis or any resources I can use to help etc. I feel like I am so close to breaking point and no one that I have ever been referred to properly listens to me and I guess itâ€™s because on the outside I come across as put together and so externally I look â€œfineâ€ which is difficult as people just donâ€™t take you seriously ðŸ˜’",bipolar_disorder
Can you be both exhausted and severely agitated when in a mixed state? I canâ€™t comprehend this as a mood state because the sensations are all so physical. I canâ€™t really function at all when in that state nor can I think properly. Thereâ€™s a feeling of terror and despair. I canâ€™t connect it to any manic features (no fast thoughts or pressured speech or flight of ideas etc). It feels like Iâ€™m dying with something but at the same time also agitated about it. It feels like cognition is quite impaired - do mixed episodes cause brain damage?,bipolar_disorder

I'm needing to start some sort of birth control, and I'm leaning towards a pill version. My problem/worry with this is that it's taken me SO LONG to finally figure out what drug combo works for me. Like, I'm finally able to function as a college student, I've been able to get my mood cycles on a leash (or at least know how to deal with them in healthier ways before) and I'm scared that by going on birth control I'll be starting over again in a way......

I've heard sooooo many stories of BC creating entirely new mood problems, weight gain, no sex drive, etc...

Of course I've looked into non-hormonal options such as a copper IUD, but they aren't fool proof, and the idea of an IUD/anything internal really freaks me out.

"19F
This year Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with bipolar ll, and itâ€™s been a year with a lot of extreme life changes that has caused me a lot of rapid cycling because I was unmedicated (just recently starting). It definitely feels like life makes a lot more sense to me now, as a lot of my behaviors have been confusing to myself, family, and friends. I feel, as early as 12, I began to notice weeks where I would get barley any sleep and would be so hyper and irritable, and I would have no appetite. It was usually followed by a crash which left me unable to get out of bed for even longer, and has consistently happened since then. It got noticeably worse as I turned 15 as I had much more risky, hyper, aggressive and irritable symptoms (always with a depressive crash) which put a lot of strain on my relationships with others. I hear that bipolar can usually show up in late teens/young adulthood, but Iâ€™ve been exhibiting the same symptoms since I was a preteen. Can it show up that early?

Before that first mania, I was a great read, even an intellectual. I was reading a lot. But since I got narcissistically abused by a devilish friend and had bipolar 1, I lost my ability to read. I can not read. I mourn over the time I spent without reading. I'm perplexed, I don't know what really caused it.

I was a swimmer, amateur but I was a swimmer and I was only rating the healthy foods, organic and stuff. Now, I lost all my ability to control myself because it all seem pointless. I still irregularly swim, but can't control my diet as I used do.

I was moderately social, had close friends. All of them left me without any explanation after my first manic episode. Now, I feel like I even lost my social skills to the point that isolated me.

"So Iâ€™ve been seeing 2 therapists. I know itâ€™s kind of odd but it has been approved by both therapists. One is a Christian therapist that Iâ€™ve been working with for 2 years. He helps me with CBT therapy and general spiritual stuff. I have made a ton of progress with him and really like him. About a year ago my psychiatrist recommended DBT therapy so I did DBT group and really benefited from it. I took those skills to my Christian therapist and he has been using the skills in therapy with me and learning them too. In DBT you are supposed to do group and individual therapy but the DBT therapist was so booked that I only saw him every 2 months or so when he had a cancellation. So I graduated DBT group but I ended up in the hospital and the DBT therapist wanted to see me. He made room in his schedule for an 8:30am appointment once a week and said I could continue seeing my other therapist. So fast forward to today, Iâ€™m doing really well and itâ€™s been a year since my hospitalization but I still have lingering depression. Anyways my DBT therapist never shows up on time. My appointment is at 8:30 but he typically doesnâ€™t show up until 9. He even said to not cancel when Iâ€™m going to be out of town so another client isnâ€™t scheduled because â€œyou are the only one who wonâ€™t complain about me being late.â€ Iâ€™ve been really put off by this as I am paying a full copay for a 30 minute session. The DBT therapist is also really distracted during session and ends up talking the whole time, sometimes about a movie he saw or about how busy he is. He gives me a good nugget every now and again but overall I feel like I donâ€™t matter to him. My other therapist has been having me listen to a DBT podcast and I have gotten more out of that than I have from my actual DBT therapist and with my Christian therapist I get an hour session and I pay $10 as he sees me on an income based scale. All this being said, should I fire my DBT therapist and just stick with my Christian therapist and continue to study DBT? Or should I stick it out? Or I could find another DBT therapist and possibly not be able to see my Christian therapist. Sorry for the long post but Iâ€™m not sure what to do at this point in my recovery.

"For some context, Iâ€™m doing an internship at a production companyâ€™s office as a PA. Before I started, I thought it would be a good idea to try out what itâ€™s like to work in that part of the industry, but I now deeply regret it.

Not only am I unpaid, but Iâ€™ve been pushed to my breaking point. I have Bipolar II Disorder and tale 400mg of lamictal, which causes severe memory issues. They donâ€™t care that I forget things involuntarily, and donâ€™t plan on writing down memos on what I need to get done that day. Iâ€™m also dyscalculic and have trouble with numbers, especially when they rap them out and refuse to repeat what they had said.

While they had listed this internship as a â€˜working experience in filmâ€™, I find myself bringing them lunch, traveling 2+ hours to buy my boss an Apple watch, walking 30,000 steps under the sun on a hot day for a location scouting in an impossible time frame with a deadline, and doing things for them outside of my working hours. Iâ€™ve been given 6 tasks at once and been expected to finish all of them in the span of two hours.

They got irritated when I bought bottles of juice instead of juice boxes, but they had never specified that I need to bring boxes.

"Hello family. It's been a while. Long story short, I (26f) had a planned pregnancy and gave birth to our little one July 23. Never did I imagine things to be this difficult. Hard? Yes. Challenging? Absolutely. But it's so much more than that. 


I'm lucky to be a stay at home mom. My husband works 7:30a-2p, so I have help. When he gets home from work, we hang out as a family, have supper, then I sleep from about 7p-midnight. My husband goes to bed at 1a. So I'm getting unbroken sleep, so I wouldn't say that's my big issue. Yes, staying up with the baby through the night and day until my husband gets home to help is exhausting. We are both exhausted. ""Nap when the baby naps"" is fucking brilliant advice. Truly ground breaking. However, he wakes up as soon as I set him down most of the time. Other times I lay him down and he sleeps maybe 30 minutes. I cannot fall asleep and wake up on my toes that quickly. It's not possible for me. He has to be fed as soon as he opens his eyes or he is screaming, as babies do. 


Being a stay at home mom with an 8 week old baby has been extremely isolating and lonely. I feel paranoid at night more than before. I constantly worry about SIDS. We had previous miscarriages. I live 2 hours away from my family. My in laws aren't people I want to be around. My mom friends have jobs, and babe isn't vaccinated yet so playdates aren't a thing for us right now. We are currently a single vehicle family, so I can't drive us anywhere to get out of the house. Walking our neighborhood isn't much of an option, because people let their dogs roam the streets and they're aggressive. 


All of this is more of a rant/vent, but I'm looking for advice on how to keep my depression at a minimum while feeling so isolated. The other parent groups talk about postpartum depression/anxiety, but aren't diagnosed as bipolar on top of that. I feel like I have ""depression and anxiety x2"" My psych has had me on meds (Lamictal, Buspar) for over a year. But I'm not sure if anything else can be done. The weight of the guilt for not enjoying the ""happiest time of my life"" is crushing me. I love my baby with all of my being. I do. There are so many horror stories about people seeking help postpartum and child protective services taking their child away. I feel like with my existing diagnosis on file already would make them instantly snatch my baby from me. 


Thanks for sticking to the end of this.",bipolar_disorder

I was actually really happy today doing so, but I noticed I was very scatter brained and energetic/positive. Thatâ€™s when I knew I was manic.

"Y'all today I had an appointment with my psychiatrist. It was supposed to be a check in but instead it led to her telling me I've been hypomanic for the past three to four weeks, just like everyone else has been telling me, that I need to cut down (like WAY down) on my caffeine use, that this is not sustainable and it probably won't just fix itself naturally or nicely, that I should up my lamotrigine, this is an issue because I'm alarming people around me, blah blah blah...

But she ""upgraded"" me to BP2 instead of cyclothymia. I was devastated. I had a miniature crisis. I mean like I just sat and stared at nothing for hours.

But lo and behold! I gained access, for the first time, to my documents and appointment summaries. It turns out I am NOT ONLY BP2, but APPARENTLY she has NEGLECTED TO TELL ME that she ALSO diagnosed me with OCD AND GAD!

"Heya! I have been having a strange and rather nice experience the last couple of days. A few days ago I started talking more and feeling really really happy. I knew then that hypomania kicked in, especially because I had a lot of ""brilliant"" ideas. I wanted to change my career from behavioural scientist to game art developer. I also wanted to shave half of my head because it would look cool, but thankfully I didn't act on that (though it would look cool). 
But some of them actually were good ideas, I booked a few trips, a festival and a holiday. I'm gonna stop booking things now but it's nice to have some fun activities in the near future.

Besides the impulsiveness and talking I felt fine, just really happy and excited about things. I also slept perfectly normal. It was different than normal happy, hard to explain but the hypomanic happiness feels a bit out of place (does anyone else experience this difference too?)

Yesterday I felt the shift to the dark side, but it isn't that bad now. I'm really tired, a bit passive and it's hard to stay motivated for work and other things. But if I take things slow it will be fine.

"Iâ€™m feeling down right now. October of last year my mood stabilizer (depakote) was increased from 750mg to 1000mg, after I got out of the psych ward. I was doing ok for a few months and then in January I had some stressors going on so my dr and I decided to increase my dose to 1250mg. It really helped. I wasnâ€™t feeling sad at night anymore and I wasnâ€™t feeling as hopeless. I stayed on that dose for about a month and a half. I was sleeping all the time tho and I felt like I just had no energy. March 16 I had an appt with my dr and I told him about the fact that I was tired all the time and sleeping all the time and we decided to go back down to 1000mg. Since being back on 1000, I notice I am not sleeping as much and I honestly feel like I have a bit more energy. However, I notice I am feeling generally more anxious and uneasy and sad and agitated more easily feeling. Itâ€™s a bit disheartening. Back when I was in the Psych ward, they started me on Latuda in addition to depakote and lexapro. I then however stopped it bc I felt like it was too much and giving me too much energy. Im wondering if the reason im feeling more down is because I went down on my dose? Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s that or if im crazy. I hope im making sense.

 I donâ€™t even want to see my girlfriend (we donâ€™t live together).

Not so often I can get super cranky if sheâ€™s asking too many questions ( just random stuff)

Even her sending regular texts can trigger me, sometimes itâ€™s just too much input.

I love her very much and we have a good relationship btw.

She says I can respond in an agressive way and that itâ€™s not ok.

I donâ€™t want to hurt her feelings so I always choose my words carefully, trough the anger, but even when I say sentences that are ok, they still sound as if Iâ€™m the hulk, and I hate it. I feel like screaming, but I donâ€™t want to upset her, because I love her.

3 weeks ago I started a new WFH job. The WFH lifestyle is awesome and I really donâ€™t want to give it up now. The job itself though is terrible. 

Now Iâ€™m a medical services coordinator. My job is to schedule, cancel, or reschedule disability exams for US vets. We were told originally that weâ€™d have 6 weeks of training, but now theyâ€™re having us take live calls after 3 weeks.

I donâ€™t blame the vets at all because Iâ€™d be pissed too. 

Iâ€™m realizing Iâ€™m just not equipped to handle a job like this. I forget things, miss important details, and it feels like I have no personality outside of my script. I want to help the vets but I also want to scream and pull my hair out when I have to wait so long for a response. 

I feel like Iâ€™m simply back to the drawing board. I thought I would be a great fit for this job but I feel like an alien signing into my computer every day. I feel so alone when im working and leadership doesnâ€™t notice or care. 

My plan is to submit a request for a reasonable accommodation to hopefully get another few weeks of training before I have to take live calls again.

I have, since my teens, obsessed over building strong discipline and intrapersonal skills in order to avoid forming any kind of significant emotional attachments. I believe this personal work has helped me avoid seeking care (for better or worse) and I'm looking forward to seeing how my life changes now that I'm openly addressing them. 

My self-work along with my symptoms have gotten significantly more difficult since getting married and having a child. I've compromised more than is healthy on my boundaries so I can continue to show up for those who depend on me. I have recently realized I owe it to them to seek treatment. However, it feels truly awful being in this in-between-place where my friends and family are skeptical about how hard I work to stay vigilant of my emotional state. I know I have (to some degree) brought this on myself by masking my symptoms -a remnant of an abusive past- but trying to reverse that has thus far felt like a lost cause. I know things will likely get better with treatment, but it's such a confusing time trying to hammer down what's what. Can anyone relate to that?

"hello my friends 
i have bipolar one. i recently got a doc who finally prescribed lithium and my life was significantly better (until it wasnâ€™t). i kinda fell off the train of taking my meds the last few days, mainly cause itâ€™s really hard to get out of bed and iâ€™m scared of being late again and getting fired. 

regardless my partner has opted for telling me to â€œjust take your medsâ€, which could be the hypomania but makes me so angry. i hate being told what to do even if itâ€™s out of concern. when i explained that to them they just kinda said â€œyeah iâ€™m not comfortable just sitting by watching you self destructâ€. its not self destructing iâ€™m just doing my best to balance bipolar and work?

how do you all handle this? i saw my psych today, she upped my lithium and added some other stuff, iâ€™m gonna get back on the wagon but i wanted to hear how yâ€™all or your partners handle med noncompliance bc itâ€™s a huge issue in my treatment history and i donâ€™t wanna fight. i donâ€™t want to be told what to do with my body by someone whoâ€™s never experience what iâ€™m experiencing. i also understand where theyâ€™re coming from. aaahhhh. this feels like a silly issue but itâ€™s major.",bipolar_disorder
"Recently diagnosed and my relationship with my current job pushed me to reach out to a psychiatrist. My current job has made me feel the worst symptoms Iâ€™ve ever had in my life. Barely getting sleep, working until odd hours of the night to get stuff done while trying to remain present and engaged in normal conversation with co-workers. I cry after meetings when the smallest thing goes wrong. 

Then when mania creeps in I just spend excessive amounts on my hobbies to make me feel better. Or pick up new hobbies and spend money on them only for them to be half completed. I still have a fish tank with no water in itâ€¦Finding happiness in anything is difficult. 

Iâ€™m trying to quit but itâ€™s proven difficult because I lack the experience needed to move to the next level in my career. Iâ€™m at a standstill because I have to work or else Iâ€™ll starve and die.

"TL;DR: I was advised by a doctor to take time off to get my new meds stabilized as my job was too stressful. For â€œentirely unrelatedâ€ reasons Iâ€™m now not getting my contract renewed.

I work as a teacher and had a mental break down at the beginning of the year. I wound up in the psych hospital after a serious bout of depression. Then it got worse and I couldnâ€™t even get out of bed without having panic attacks. My doctor wrote up all the paperwork for me to get 3 months to readjust. Itâ€™s a legal right you can take if a doctor orders it where I live (FMLA). Theyâ€™re not even allowed to use that time as a reason to fire me.

Under the guise of downsizing, they informed me my contract will not be renewed for next year. When speaking to one of the bosses, they *wink*wink* told me that it would have been different if I needed time for a surgery.

I was always frightened of taking time for my mental health, and this was exactly what I worried about. Iâ€™ve been scared to tell my bosses that I have bipolar for the same reason, and nowâ€¦ now Iâ€™m going to be once bitten twice shy.",bipolar_disorder

anyway - the doctor has to do a blood test on me every once in a while to check that theyâ€™re not messing with my organs. i recently switched to a new doctor and got a blood test - yesterday she called me and said that she wanted to talk to me about the results the next day (today) iâ€™m kind of freaking out because she said sheâ€™d only call me if something was wrong?

"I really am so tired of feeling so bad all the time, I have worked so hard to get where I am, but I feel so empty. I'm so awkward in every situation even though I may look fine on the outside. I may have been able to make a good mask for myself but I feel like it is crumbling away everyday. I never thought I would be able to achieve the little accomplishments I have, but none of it seems to matter, I have been isolating from the people I was close to for seven years now, the time of my last, incredibly destructive manic episode. I learned to stay on my medication after that. It took awhile and some brushes with death, and many more embarrassing stunts to learn I also need to be sober. After a stint in rehab for the 10th time I was able to get 14 months of sobriety. But then I relapsed, got a new job and went 3 months of rationing medication and walking that thin line of sanity. I have gotten insurance again, but I feel like going back to rehab isn't really an option right now. I need to start going to meetings again just to be around others. I feel like all I do is work and lock myself in my room and sleep. It's so daunting that I'm going to have to learn how to cope with this and I don't see how I can. I am able to take my meds and keep my head down during the week, but on the weekends I lose all self control. In the end I guess it doesn't matter, everyday is a  new opportunity too make the correct choices but I am just so tired of questioning my sanity and feeling like I shouldn't let myself get close to anyone.

"This year has been a nightmare.  I experienced  a marriage crisis, which set off a manic episode after 10 years of relatively stable moods. During those 16 years I earned three college degrees including a masters degree in special education and eventually professional certification in a specialized field. I've enjoyed a well paying job and respect in my field until may last spring. As anybody with bipolar knows. What goes up must come down. I experienced months of crippling depression.  I took FMLA for four weeks  (extended medical leave in the US) and used up all my medical leave days and almost all my vacation time and my work has suffered. After my FMLA my supervisor and her supervisor had a meeting with me to ""catch up"" on my clients.  Instead it was a surprise mid year evaluation and a performance improvement plan. I was traumatized and experienced a massive anxiety attack. Ever since then every time I met with my boss I had an anxiety attack. I was truly ready to walk away and told my boss I was going on long term disability but have had doubts since that decision. I dont want to lose my paycheck or insurance. My mood is stable now, however the anxiety attacks have remained. I was written up for unprofessional behavior which wrecked me as I've never had a bad evaluation or corrective action..  It's embarrassing to go back and so humbling.  I've been so erratic.  Here I go to grovel at the feet of my administration and repent. My supervisor knows about my bipolar and I'm in the process of applying for accommodations.  My boss is a psychologist by the way and that truth makes it worse somehow.  I'm scared but hopeful.",bipolar_disorder

The biggest trigger is my college environment, which is a small and depressing private college. There is no way for me to hide my symptoms because everyone knows everyone, and I even passed out once last month at class due to a panic attack. These caused my greatest fear to face the professor and the class.

"i know antipsychotics are known to cause weight gain. however iâ€™ve heard mixed things on why

is it because of the increased appetite? seroquel in specific lists insatiable hunger as a side effect. currently iâ€™m unmedicated but iâ€™ve taken seroquel in the past, and donâ€™t get this side affect at all. 

i may get it as a side effect for other medication, which iâ€™m aware of. iâ€™m hopefully soon going to see a psychiatrist so i can actually get on meds, and based on past experience i canâ€™t actually function with the seroquel because of extreme drowsiness it gives me the next day. so thatâ€™s out of the picture

iâ€™ve read mixed things about the weight gain, some people say their appetite never changed and the medication itself caused significant weight gain, while others say it was the appetite increase. iâ€™m very concerned about this as a side effect because iâ€™m currently suffering with anorexia and weight gain is a huge trigger for depressive episodes for me. i know some meds donâ€™t cause hunger or weight gain but iâ€™m concerned that i wonâ€™t get a say in what iâ€™m prescribed, and iâ€™m even more concerned to be prescribed one with weight gain on purpose (to try increase my weight with the AN)

"(25F, USA) i started trying out meds for ADHD with wellbutrin (i mentioned to my psych i suspect i also have depression). it didn't work outâ€”gave me a lot of anxiety i couldn't handle. we agreed to stop taking it (i lasted about 18 days). now my psych is recommending ritalin (i haven't started yet).

after more research, the wellbutrin might've given me a hypomanic episode. i researched more about hypomania and started thinking i might have bipolar 2, since reading about the cycle of having hypomania + depressive episodes seem familiar to me, especially with how i noticed my mood has been like since 2021.

**a TLDR is at the bottom if you want to skip the details below.** however reading it is appreciated\~

========

i messaged my psych about this (how i might have bipolar disorder with my adhd, and i would like to talk about it more) and she doesn't seem open about it. granted, it might also be my mistake in wording it... i said it ""might be a product of my overthinking""â€”which i know is valid, however i've definitely been researching more since i've sent that message to her, and can compile evidence as to what my hypomanic + depressive episodes/cycles look like (if i do have bp2).

i do still want to push for us to talk about this. my gut is telling to. and even if i end up not having bipolar disorder, then won't it be good to check it off the list? i've seen some people in this community say that their psychs checked for signs of both ADHD + bipolar before they were formally diagnosed, so it's still worth it to see, right?

i know i might still be overthinking as of now... but it might be safer to check... i heard stimulants (like ritalin) could even trigger a manic/hypomanic episode if you have bipolar, and my psych didn't even tell me about that. we haven't really discussed what other diagnoses i may have (other than me bringing up depression, though we didn't talk about it much since ADHD seems to be very clear), so if i never researched about bipolar disorder more, i wouldn't even know it's a common comorbidity with ADHD... infact an ADHD (non-bp, as far as we know, but has also done some research as well) friend of mine also wondered if i do experience hypomania since they noticed my cycles as well.

========

**TLDR:**

i think i may have bipolar 2 (along or instead of my ADHD is unknown for now), can make a ""case"" for it (gather evidence), and want to discuss it with my psych, however she's hesitant. is it worth it for me to push the discussion? i'd like to try at least one more time. if that doesn't work, i might have to switch doctors again (which sucks since it can take months).

honestly at this point, i just want validation that i'm not possibly wasting my time? i'm glad she's prescribing me ritalin and all but i want to be cautious about taking it if i actually do have bipolar...

What pisses me off the most is the fact that itâ€™s so difficult to manage this high libido. It doesnâ€™t interfere with day to day activities and I donâ€™t make rash decisions or any of that but it does get on my nerves on particularly bad days when Iâ€™m so horny and have nothing to do or canâ€™t concentrate on stuff coz Iâ€™m so horny and thatâ€™s when I canâ€™t do shit. Masturbation only works for so long. Now it canâ€™t Do shit. Iâ€™d rather have an actual man. This high libido gets on my nerves big time!!",bipolar_disorder
"Sometimes I just feel overwhelmed by the stigma that comes from being bipolar. I don't talk about it to anyone except my sister, my dad, my husband and 2 friends. No one knows I'm bipolar or that I have been hospitalized twice besides those people. It just feels like no one really knows me because it takes a lot of effort to manage bipolar disorder. I had someone at work tell me her husband who is a nurse thinks bipolar women are the nastiest women anywhere and he hates taking care of them. And then everyone talks about Kanye West and how being bipolar explains all his behavior. I'm sorry but I don't think bipolar disorder causes you to make death threats to people and stalk people and always look for maximal attention. He is a narcissist and an asshole and that doesn't have anything to do with bipolar disorder. I just get tired of feeling ashamed of it. And never being able to talk about it to anyone.

And I totally could; some of the people I know would love to spend a night over if I just gave them a call, but I would never hurt my partner like that. But that desire is just 24/7 in my head and it's driving me nuts.

Just having these thoughs is making feel terrible; I feel like I'm cheating because when me and my s.o have sex, I'm thinking about someone else, and when they leave I just have that urge to call someone over. I think about them, and then a feel like shit. And this has been my last couple of weeks. 

It almost makes want to break up with my partner, because what's the point if they're not the ones I'm thinking about.

"This is kind of a DAE post and me looking for some inspiration on how to manage things. I have schizoaffective and Iâ€™m on a pretty hefty dose of lithium and rexulti(brexpiprazole). I also take some meds for my ADHD and PTSD. They all help but I end up just feeling like a shell. Like Iâ€™m functioning but Iâ€™m not even me.

Lately everything has been feeling so overwhelming. Getting up, going to my college classes, taking care of my dogs needs, /keeping my apartment clean/, feeding myself, reading my course materials etc. It literally feels never ending and I donâ€™t want to do any of it. I also have heavy anxiety about failing in life. Iâ€™m on all these meds and I still have symptoms, a somewhat manageable amount where I can function but everything stays hard. And then the side effects of the meds affect me too. Iâ€™m grateful for my medication because I would be dead without it. 

Last week I got very suicidal and depressed, my psych figured out my lithium was too high. It scared my partner and they couldnâ€™t understand properly what I felt. I feel better now and not dangerous to myself. But every task feels so hard and I have to will myself to do them. I just donâ€™t see a whole lot of point in anything right now and would rather just walk my dog or watch my favorite tv shows.

Guys, I was miserable at this job, intensely triggering, and I even went to crisis over it.

finding and maintaining a job has been difficult as hell. i dropped out of college, and have been fired technically three or four times within the past year. iâ€™m currently working another job and want to just turn in my key and quit. i got this job around 2-3 weeks ago after i was hospitalized again. iâ€™m approaching burnout so fast and i had to leave my last shift due to feeling physically sick, but mainly because i was having a breakdown and couldnâ€™t handle it.

On one hand Iâ€™m excited to see where it goes. On the other Iâ€™m not sure if I can handle a relationship because of my ups and downs and jealous manic ocd etc episodes and if someone will even be able to handle me. Then thereâ€™s the dreaded talk. I donâ€™t think he would have an issue with my diagnosis, he doesnâ€™t seem like that kind of a person. I just donâ€™t want to drag someone into this even willingly and then make their life difficult with this diseaseâ€¦itâ€™s hard for me to deal with let alone someone elseâ€¦but then again, I donâ€™t want to be alone for the rest of my life.

They took her phone and the hospital she originally checked into won't tell anyone where she's been relocated to.

"Ever since I got diagnosed with bipolar, I've been somewhat obsessively reading about it. However, the answer to this I could never properly find, either because it hasn't been studied or because I don't know the right terms for it. But I'm curious to see if other people also experience it and, it so, does someone have a name for it. 

Anyhow, not every time, but occasionally when I'm in my low mood, waiting for something big in my life, I get crippling anxiety. Now, the problem is not the anxiety part. I get super OCD about it, to the point that I cannot lead my life normally. When I walk, I need not touch the lines on the road with my feet. I need to cross the line with my left foot. I need to touch the door knob ten times before I let go off it. I cannot fall asleep unless all of my things are turned westward, etc. The list goes on. The problem is that if I don't do it, I think that I will not get the thing that I'm waiting for, kinda like that I'll get bad luck. So this is my safe way of ensuring good luck. But that doesn't last forever, once I feel good or get what I want, I stop doing it. Then it repeats again, another cycle. Anyways, I was wondering if anyone else is going though this and, if so, can you point me to some literature I can read on about it?

I had been on seroquel and welbutrin and a low dose of lamictal, and it was clearly not doing its job because I was still getting hypomanic/mixed for weeks and severely depressed. Then I started lithium but went toxic and was in the hospital for a good week. Went up on my dose of Lamotrigine, went off welbutrin, and started mirtazapine. Not a ton changed but I wasn't getting hypomanic anymore. 

Then fucking insurance decided I didn't actually need 400mg of Lamotrigine or 15mg mirtazapine so I couldn't refill and was off meds for 2 weeks and went into the worst depression I've ever been in. I went halfway through with a suicide attempt but felt terrible about the idea that my boyfriend could wake up to a dead girl right next to him. So I went to bed and went to work the next day. But I started throwing up uncontrollably so one of the nurses walked me across the street to another hospital where I got back onto my meds very quickly.

And now I actually feel great! There are situational moments of sadness but not depression? I've never felt this emotionally stable.

"So my husband has bipolar 1 and he says that when heâ€™s manic heâ€™s really disconnected from his real feelings and just gets a bunch of thoughts that can really deceive him into thinking that those thoughts are his real feelings. He says it seems like fake feelings. 

For example, he could be having thoughts like I feel great but his heart is pounding and his body feelings terrible but he is convinced heâ€™s doing amazing. Or another example would be that heâ€™s getting intrusive thoughts like â€œyou like this, youâ€™re attracted to thisâ€ even when he isnâ€™t. Heâ€™s just very convinced he is because of how disconnected he is from his true feelings and is feeling very psychotic. 

I guess itâ€™s just hard for me to understand what that means. I just assumed whatever people think they feel while manic is actually how they feel, even if they donâ€™t feel that way baseline.

"As is always said, to disclose your problems with someone close to us, is a good and important thing to do, and I am often thinking about what am I missing. 

I am male 21. In my life, I have tried to tell about it to my mother, when I realized that something is wrong with me. At the same time, I felt really bad and wanted some professional help (I was 16). I tried to explain that something is wrong with me but i got turned down that it is a part of puberty and stuffâ€¦ Never attempted it again (my mother does not believe in such a things). Then, 4 years later, I was a bit â€œcuriousâ€ and again at the bottom (the most I have ever been). I have told about it to my friend to whom I trusted. I had mostly bad feelings and regrets although she made me feel ok when it was needed. I do not like to talk about it, and therefore she knows very little (maybe it is a mistake?). I believe that since that moment something has changed, but cannot tell for sure because my mind is often lying to me. Anyway, we gradually lost our connections.

Right now, no one knows about it and i feel like it is the best thing. I just simply feel so secure and I am totally sure that I do not bother anyone nor anybody is worried about me. Actually no one can really help, only me. The past experience showed me, that nothing has really changed and I have more peace in my mind if no one knows.

So I just want to know some of your opinions about disclosing to others. Positives, negatives, experience?

Thank you",bipolar_disorder
"I'm currently feeling really depressed and confused about my diagnosis. Doctors and therapists have told me I fit the symptoms but I'm not sure how much I believe it. Some people in my life (husband and in laws) have told me they're pretty sure I am but a lot of other people have told me to get another opinion and aren't convinced I am (mom and online friends). I have an appointment with my pdoc in a couple weeks and I'm going to bring this up. Tbh, the idea of me possibly being bipolar is making me depressed and making me have some SI, but the idea of me NOT having bipolar also confuses me because then I don't know what actually makes me feel the way I do. My current pdoc and a therapist I used to see brought up BPD asking if I thought that was a possibility and...maybe? I'm not 100% sure about that either. I've seen some recent posts related to this so I thought I'd make this post to see if anyone has any help for me or has this problem too.",bipolar_disorder

"Iâ€™ve had my diagnosis for over 15 years and I empathize with a lot of the fears, doubts and hopelessness shared on this subreddit. I hope my story might help to show that you are not alone and that there is hope. *Trigger warning: suicide story*

At 17 I was a model student. All the teachers knew me, I had good grades, a spotless record and lots of friends. By the end of grade 12 I had skipped most of my classes, had no idea what was going on in class, had a bad reputation with staff and had no friends. I had sunk into a severe depression and was a danger to myself. Everyone expected me to go to university but I wasnâ€™t sure I was even going to pass grade 12. 

At the end of the year I finally reached out for help and started Prozac. My grades were pro-rated so I could graduate (basically I got the average mark of each class as my final grade). Prozac made me have severe panic attacks, racing thoughts and intense anger. I didnâ€™t realize then but that was my first taste of mania. The doc switched my antidepressant twice but my symptoms got worse. So I saw a psychiatrist. He put me on lithium. I was extremely insulted that he implied I had bipolar disorder. I thought he was crazy. But the lithium helped a lotâ€¦ as much as I hated to admit it. 

I started feeling good (really goodâ€¦) and went to universityâ€¦. during my first full manic episode. I signed up for 10 classes but never went to them because I felt I already knew the material well enough some how. For the record 5 classes is considered full time. But I thought I could do 10. I failed the midterms and was furious with my profs for it. I spent all my student loan in the first month. 

At the end of the semester I was coming down and was really depressed. I knew I would fail university. The SI kicked into high gear and I planned to kill myself after Christmas. Then there was the Christmas party. All my relatives at my house except my cousin and his dad. We got a call later that day and my aunt took the phone. I heard her screaming. It was my uncle saying my cousin had committed suicide at home. He was 17. I watched as my aunt and her daughter fell to the floor and cried. All I could think was that I was planning to do that to my sister and mother too. The scariest part was this still didnâ€™t stop the SI. It was then I knew I needed to get help and fast. 

I saw my doctor and was admitted to the psych ward. It was the first time I was officially diagnosed with bipolar. So began years of hospitalizations, countless meds and hours of therapy. Nothing helped. I was a zombie, taking 20 pills a day. My mother had given up on me at that point. I had no one. I was living in a basement unable to leave my bed. My doctor said he had run out of ideas and suggested ECT as his last one. I agreed - I had nothing to lose. But I promised it would be the last thing I try. 

Ten bilateral shocks over 5 months. I lost a year of my memory and had a little trouble with short term memory for a few months. At 5 shocks I started to feel better but then slowly started feeling worse again. During a mixed episode I made an attempt on my life but it failed. I continued the treatments. After 10 sessions and the discovery that my thyroid had stopped working, for the first time in 5 years, I wasnâ€™t suicidal. I was feeling happy. And it felt weird and wrong at first. But I started to realize I deserved to feel happy. That I had earned it. 

I worked at a dollar store for a year before trying to go back to school. Things went much better this time. I finished my degree and then did my Masters. I am currently doing my PhD. I never though the life I have now was possible. It saddens me to know I almost missed out on it. 

I still have episodes but they arenâ€™t as severe. I take medication still too. I probably always will. The ECT wasnâ€™t a cure but it helped to make my meds and mindfulness techniques more effective. I also follow a pretty strict routine. 

I am sometimes pessimistic and wonder when the stability will end. But whether it ends one day or not Iâ€™ll enjoy it while I have it. Remember you deserve life, and you deserve happiness. I wish my cousin could have gotten the help he needed. Our entire family has never been the same. We miss him very much.

It only got worse last year especially being hospitalized. I never even knew I had hurt her. She never told me. I guess looking back I should have known. I wasnâ€™t there. I didnâ€™t ask about her health issues as much as I should have because I was too knee deep in my own, trying to find stability, trying to be happy and safe.

"So Iâ€™m on Lamictal 150mg and Iâ€™m almost up to 200, and so far so good.

Iâ€™ve had a couple hypomania scares even on Seroquel but that was due to excess caffeine and stress - which are triggers for manic episodes but they never progressed to anything more than a little sleep deprivation (a few hours of missed sleep) and feeling out of it the next day. As well I do get some racing thoughts but that could also be an anxiety thing (diagnosed PTSD and BPD) and what I think could be manic obsessions are actually hyperfixations coming into play (Iâ€™m also autistic).

I was on Seroquel for a while and Iâ€™m finally tapered off of it - it worked great for the first little while but I couldnâ€™t handle the cognitive decline and it also dragged me into a depressive episode for a few months.

"Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m looking for advice or just venting, but Iâ€™m so frustrated with myself. Iâ€™ve been extra broke lately. I recently bought a car after my last one broke down and just got back from an out of state wedding for a close friend. In order to make everyday purchases, Iâ€™ve been using my credit card to pay for things since money has been extra tight. Iâ€™m not sure if this is because of my baseline ADHD poor impulse control, or if Iâ€™m having a â€œmutedâ€ manic episode (I say muted because Iâ€™ve been on stabilizers for a while and donâ€™t have full blown manic symptoms, but spending money is one of my most obvious manic symptoms), but I couldnâ€™t stop myself from spending. I didnâ€™t even realize how bad the problem had gotten until I looked at my statement and my card was almost maxed. 

All my purchases felt justified at the time, but in hindsight there are things I definitely couldâ€™ve gone without. Sometimes itâ€™s like I physically canâ€™t stop myself. Itâ€™s like the little voice that says â€œokay but do you actually need this? Can you afford it?â€ Completely goes away. 

Itâ€™s so frustrating because I did this several years ago when I was first diagnosed and it took years to fully pay it off. Thankfully I make a lot more money now so hopefully it wonâ€™t take quite as long, but things are still pretty tight. Iâ€™m having to dip into my dwindling savings just to buy gas and groceries.

I hate to be the one who â€œself-diagnoseâ€ Iâ€™m not but the symptoms as I have been reading everywhere fits exactly how Iâ€™ve always been my whole life and wondered why but shrugged it off and thought it was normal. 

I have been told several times I â€œact bipolarâ€ I would feel as if Iâ€™m on top of the world, unstoppable, and felt like as if I could take on anything and anyone. I feel impulsive, I would dye my hair, spend tremendous amounts of money, get new piercings, be impulsive..etc.

Then Iâ€™d fall into a black pit and think to myself, â€œwhy did I do that? Why did I spend that much money? I hate myself. Now ima struggleâ€ Then a few days later or weeks later, I go back into that mindset of â€œDamn.

"My mood has steadily been going up, and I have been advised from here to talk to my pdoc. I called my GP who has been primarily my caregiver to see if we can make an appointment with my psychiatrist. 

I feel on the verge of a panic attack, like I should not be seeking help because it's not that bad. I have lived with this for 20+ and just because I am newly diagnosed I don't really have any faith that things will get better. Besides the occasional solid nights sleep I have not seen anything that makes a direct improvement. And my latuda took weeks before side effects leveled off and my brain has a bit more clarity. 

So my mood is becoming more irritable, not like they can do anything in time to stop it. Not like therapy wait list and self work will happen in time. Not like I can stop hating myself enough to sleep properly at night and practice self care. Not like a support system is going to magically poof into being. 

And since I don't pose a danger to others what is the point? I don't get manic enough be delusional even though paranoia has become a problem at times.  I am used to masking and hibernating to hide away that I am mentally hurting. I can already feel myself pulling away from people.

"Because of my mental health and other circumstances, I am currently unemployed and not in school - and will be for the foreseeable future.

My life is almost completely focused on treatment but I have nothing else going for me. I even moved for treatment - so I am basically a stranger in a strange land. Literary reference not unintentional.

I value myself around being productive or at least having some semblance of 'moving forward.' I know the knee jerk reaction to the latter comment would go along the lines of 'treatment is progress's but at this point I need something more to look forward to or work on. 

I am currently applying to schools, but there's no guarantee of acceptance - especially for the near future. Because of my visa status, I can't do much in terms of employment and volunteering.

Regardless, I'm on the verge of returning to alcoholism. I'm lonely and directionles.

Especially this song - [Lostâ€¦ / â€¦Out Past Saturn](https://youtu.be/RHc2z7HYE-Q).

"\[I think I can't put  two flairs (Idk how Reddit works that much) to also put Dangerous Behavior warning, this is mainly a story but I do briefly mention suicide and self harm\]

Today I got sat down by my boss and the assistant manager (I work retail). I've been having issues this week with dizziness/lightheadedness/tingling sensations that are really making it bothersome to work because I've been switching between antidepressants. I mentioned it to my coworkers and I guess someone snitched on to me to the boss. plus I was crying when I came in from lunch yesterday and my coworker saw so they told the boss that as well. As they put it today, ""legally if I feel sick then they have to send me home"". I said it's because of medications. They asked me what it's for and I Broke down crying. I told them whatis for. I never told them because I was scared they might fire me and I wanted to prove I could be a good employee first I worked there for 6 months. They are pretty nice people so I think they will not fire me but what bothered me is I Guess I Feel like they had no idea what bipolar disorder is or how it works. Because my boss asked me ""Well you do fine don't you? You seem happy while you're at work and you go to college right? So how are you able to do all that?"" and ""Well how long do you have to take the medication for? You have to take it forever?"" ""Well why don't you call your doctor and tell him it gave you side effects? Then can't he just give you a different medication?"" And it made me so upset because Yesyou see me be fine at work (Working actually usually makes me chill out and takes my mind off things) but you don't see me break down crying whe nI get home. You don't see how for the last 3 months I slept 16 hours a day and ate one meal and haven't been doing those ""college assignments that I'm doing fine in"". You don't see how I have hallucinations all the time and last year I thought license plates were talking to me. I bought a bottle of isopropyl alcohol from my work before because I Planned to drink it that night. Yeah and sure just have him put me on some other medication not like we've already tried options and not like it's costing me $200 a month with insurance benefits (I did tell him that about how fucking goddam expensive they are) I told him I'm not comfortable to answer that question but it really made me so upset, I feel ashamed and like a worthless person, I feel so mad like I keep having waves of raging mad, but mostyl I think I feel so misunderstood. 

  
And it annoys me because they sai if I feel sick I need to go home but I feel sick every day. It's just a product of my medications and I have an eating disorder too. So if you don't want me to come in feeling unwell just fucking fire me then. What the fuck do you want me to do. They don't understand how having the side effects is worth it because it makes me not fucking insane and a danger to myself every day. So part of me wants to talk with my boss, explain to him that even though I can ""act fine"" 80% of the time at work, it's really serious, I need this medications. Mostly I just don't want him to think I'm a stupid person making something out of nothing I want him to know that I have a serious condition. But at the same time I'm scared to do that because then I'm afraid I'll get let go or treated badly until I quit because who wants an employee who's fucking psychotic. Fucking fuck.

I can't get over how upset I am I took my breaks at work just to cry during them. And I keep getting so mad, when I got home I slammed my arm over and over again into the concrete wall outside which I haven't done in a long time (Like years). I had all the impulses to do worse but I'm just too fucking tired after working for eight hours. My new medications were making me feel really good too and I was doing so good and now I Feel like I just fucked up my progress. I know I am blowing things out of proportion here but I feel in this moment like  I just ruined my fucking life or something. I just can't stop crying about it just the way that he treated it like it's an easy thing to go through. I can't stay mad at him because I Know it's not his fault that he isn't educated about bipolar disorder but I feel so conflicted over whether I want to explain how bad it is or not. 

Not to tack on another thing but the reason I'm writing this all (Besides because I know anyone reading this ACTUALLY GETS IT about how hard it is) Is because I don't want to burden my partner. He is really supportive of me and I told him that something happened today but I didn't say what because I felt too ashamed. And It tears me apart to make him worry. I posted about this before but it still stands. I want to tell him because I know we're supposed to face life together as a pair but, I know I'll hurt his soul when he hears how I'm hurting. I don't feel good lying to him that I Feel fine and he will get rightfully upset if He finds out I lied to him but sometimes I want to because it feels better than telling him and making him worry or feel sad. I want to visit him this week but I know he'll cry if  he spots the bruises on my arm.

"Had a manic episode last week (had been hypo since about May and hadnâ€™t taken my mood stabilizer since August).

I was put back on my antipsychotic. I donâ€™t like the side effects.

Iâ€™m in school right now and trying to study for a test but the stress makes my mania come back. I donâ€™t feel safe in public and it feels like my meds arenâ€™t working.

Iâ€™ve become a little apathetic as well. I donâ€™t really know whatâ€™s going on",bipolar_disorder
"Happy mental health day everyone! For mental health day I wanted to share my mental health journey with you. Iâ€™ve had my diagnosis for over 15 years and I empathize with a lot of the fears, doubts and hopelessness shared on this subreddit. I used to do public speaking to try and help people going through mental health issues. I hope my story might help to show that you are not alone and that there is hope. 

At 17 I was a model student. All the teachers knew me, I had good grades, a spotless record and lots of friends. By the end of grade 12 I had skipped most of my classes, had no idea what was going on in class, had a bad reputation with staff and had no friends. I had sunk into a severe depression. Everyone expected me to go to university but I wasnâ€™t sure I was even going to pass grade 12. 

At the end of the year I finally reached out for help and started Prozac. My grades were pro-rated so I could graduate (basically I got the average mark of each class as my final grade). Prozac made me have severe panic attacks, racing thoughts and intense anger. I didnâ€™t realize then but that was my first taste of mania. The doc switched my antidepressant twice but my symptoms got worse. So I saw a psychiatrist. He put me on lithium. I was extremely insulted that he implied I had bipolar disorder. I thought he was crazy. But the lithium helped a lotâ€¦ as much as I hated to admit it. 

I started feeling less depressed and went to universityâ€¦. during my first full manic episode. I signed up for 10 classes but never went to them because I felt I already knew the material well enough some how. For the record 5 classes is considered full time. But I thought I could do 10. I failed the midterms and was furious with my profs for it. I spent all my student loan in the first month. 

At the end of the semester I was coming down and was really depressed. I knew I would fail. The SI kicked into high gear. I planned to kill myself after Christmas. Then there was the Christmas party. All my relatives at my house except my cousin and his dad. We got a call and my aunt took the phone. I heard her screaming. It was my uncle saying my cousin had hung himself in the garage. He was 17. I watched as my aunt and her daughter fell to the floor and cried. All I could think was that I was planning to do that to my sister and mother too. The scariest part was this still didnâ€™t stop the SI. It was then I decided to try and get better - even if it meant being hospitalized, which was my greatest fear at the time. 

I saw my doctor and was admitted to the psych ward. It was the first time I was officially diagnosed with bipolar. So began years of hospitalizations, countless meds and hours of therapy. Nothing helped. I was a zombie, taking 20 pills a day at one point. My mother had given up on me. I had no one. I was living in a basement unable to leave my bed. My doctor said he had run out of ideas and suggested ECT as his last one. I agreed - I had nothing to lose. But I promised it would be the last thing I try. 

10 bilateral shocks over 5 months. I lost a year of my memory and had a little trouble with short term memory for a few months. At 5 shocks I started to feel better but then slowly started feeling worse again. During a mixed episode I made an attempt on my life but it failed. I continued the treatments. After 10 sessions and the discovery that my thyroid had stopped working, for the first time in 5 years, I wasnâ€™t suicidal. I was feeling happy. And it felt weird and wrong at first. But I started to realize I deserved to feel happy. That I had earned it. 

I worked at a dollar store for a year before trying to go back to school. Things went much better this time. I finished my degree and then did my Masters. I am currently doing my PhD. I never though the life I have now was possible. It saddens me to know I almost missed out on it. 

I still have episodes but they arenâ€™t as severe. I take medication still too. I probably always will. The ECT wasnâ€™t a cure but it helped to make my meds and mindfulness techniques more effective. I also follow a pretty strict routine. 

I am sometimes pessimistic and wonder when the stability will end. But whether it ends one day or not Iâ€™ll enjoy it while I have it. Remember you deserve life, and you deserve happiness. I wish my cousin could have gotten the help he needed. His family has never been the same.

I am a single mom raising a 5 year old kid. I am working as a trainer in a BPO company. I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and Panic disorders.

"When Iâ€™m on the cusp of hypomania/mania or simply in a positive, outspoken mood, Iâ€™m talkative. As heck sometimes. It feels good to share my thoughts with others- especially family and friends and sometimes I forget how much my mouth is running.

He has sex with me once a week and he typically lasts five minutes, then he is done. 
. Physically, I have needs- and I honestly need it at least once a day to be happy. Iâ€™ve talked to him about it and talked to him about it- nothing changes. Tried sex toys, lingerie, anything- and Iâ€™m  not trying to be any type of way, but Iâ€™m a thin, short, double d blonde who has always had an easy time getting men.

"In 2020 me and my fiancÃ©e were watching modern love the one with anne Hathaway and she kinda went â€œomg thatâ€™s meâ€.  She scheduled a psychiatrist appointment the next week and received her diagnose as bipolar. 

It has been two years trying different meds and she finally settled with two that seems to stabilize her mood without much side effects.

So just a little about me, I have ocd, adhd and depression. Been treating for a couple of years and I like to think that it is under control .

My question to you fellow redditors is:is there a way to be supportive but without stepping in your comfort zone? She gets really depressed and doesnâ€™t do her things for a couple of days. What I usually do is take care of the house, food, pets and make sure she isnâ€™t missing anything urgent , with questions like â€œis there something I could help you with? â€œ or â€œis it okay if I help you withâ€¦?â€ The latter is better I think because sometimes she gets frustrated for not having the will to do stuff and she is a very independent person so I try to respect that at all times.

Today she entered this phase and I spent the day cleaning, organizing our home and setting up a nice mood. Now she is sleeping and I really want her to feel okay. She helped me when I was in my worse shape but she just knew what to do. On the other hand i just donâ€™t know.

It would be easier if she was more open about her needs and stuff but thatâ€™s part of her personality and I get that too. I will never be intrusive i just want to see her happy.

If i take this new job i would be working in a new field for the first time ever and thatâ€™s really scary cause what if iâ€™m not good enough for it. I would also be leaving behind any familiarity that i have now, i have one coworker iâ€™m close with and i also work with my boyfriend. me and him have worked separate jobs before iâ€™m just scared on how it will also change our dynamic. i know youâ€™re suppose to do things that scare you but i wanted to be in therapy for a bit and get myself in the right headspace before looking for a new job since itâ€™s so stressful. i just feel like if i donâ€™t take this opportunity iâ€™m gonna regret it (they are accepting people with no to little experience which is rare with all the job post iâ€™ve been reading). i know what i should do i just donâ€™t know how to move forward without breaking down or having a panic attack. idk what iâ€™m even looking for really i just needed to vent but if youâ€™ve read this far, thanks.",bipolar_disorder

"Have had a long and nasty battle with out of control mental health issues, which have ramped up and gotten worse over the last 3.5 years (or possibly much longer)

Finally it clicked, this is mixed symptom bipolar disorder. This is what itâ€™s been for ages now but I never clicked into it. Itâ€™s always been treated as basic depression and anxiety, which it was not. 

I went from someone who was mostly happy, to someone unrecognizable in a short matter of time. I didnâ€™t see someone I knew in the mirror. I saw a dark soul who was tired of living. 

Finally have pinned down an amazing therapist and getting on lithium. 

Finally the voices, the psychotic, the mania, the depressiveâ€¦ will all calm down and I can stop feeling like Iâ€™m constantly spiralling out of control.

"This is kind of broad and vague, but it's an interesting emerging field so I thought some might benefit from being exposed to it. I've randomly come across the term in mental health and meditation stuff. 

Interception is essentially your ability to perceive bodily sensations that are internal (heart beat, gut, kidneys, etc). There are associations between low sensitivity and depression, as well as high sensitivity for those that have higher anxiety.

There's lots of different tests but being able to sense your heartbeat is one measuring stick. Mine is very operant to me, which matches my depression that is highly anxious and not really stuck in bed type 

I was reading about a new therapy based on this mentioned in this article (https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/aug/15/the-hidden-sense-shaping-your-wellbeing-interoception ). I am just starting a search and I'm just curious if any of you have gone down this rabbit hole? Most interest if you know any techniques/exercises from this

Iâ€™m a first time mother of twins. me and my SO have been having issues due to the fact that he refuses to believe how serious being bipolar is. he was raised in Inglewood LA and grew up with his dad as an OG and all that stuff. he always says you wouldnâ€™t have survived in the hood  being so emotional. itâ€™s like he thinks iâ€™m just being overly dramatic when iâ€™m in a depressive episode. thatâ€™s kind of how everyone treats my diagnosis even my own parents. hearing that â€œiâ€™m an upper middle class privileged girl and people have it way worseâ€ i absolutely am aware of my privilege and all i have but i canâ€™t control feeling the way i do just as much as everyone around me hates me or my symptoms i hate it and myself even more. not to be edgy but i really wish i wasnâ€™t born. all this makes me feel worse and even more alone like no one gets it. I get blamed when iâ€™m â€œisolatingâ€ myself but i cant help it when everyone just thinks iâ€™m a cry baby for no reason. im always with my babies i attend to their every need i try my hardest I even stopped taking my quetiapine because my SO was getting frustrated with two crying babies in the middle of the night while i got to sleep because as most of you know quetiapine is a sedative so night feedings are for sure out of the question. i feel like iâ€™m losing my shit especially when iâ€™m trying my hardest and my mother is sitting there criticizing everything i do making me feel like an awful mother in her eyes i donâ€™t deserve these babies. I tell myself to deal with it because sheâ€™s probably worried about the babies which i donâ€™t blame her too much considering my destructive past but these babies make me feel different i want to do everything and anything i can for them i would never let anything bad happen to them. theyâ€™re the only thing that makes me happy and smile when they cry it hurts i try everything to help and cheer them up i donâ€™t even know where this is going anymore i donâ€™t know how i feel but iâ€™m feeling something anger sadness rage alone i just feel like i canâ€™t go back on my meds i canâ€™t leave them with him at night but also i feel his resentment grow because he just doesnâ€™t understand what i go through he doesnâ€™t understand that itâ€™s an illness no one does i donâ€™t know what to do there is no time to do anything i havenâ€™t seen my therapist since i was in my last trimester she got a new job in irvine and didnâ€™t refer me to anyone else i really really wish i could,bipolar_disorder

I am only saying this because it is so rare, that your doctor may not associate hallucinations with this drug. Do not let this post scare you off of taking this drug if it is prescribed to you. It can be a lifesaver for many.

Again, I'm not bashing this drug. It helps so many people with bipolar and if you are not experiencing any symptoms of hallucinations, do not worry about it. It's a great drug and if you're doctor recommends it, you should take it. The hallucination symptoms are very slow to develope, so if you feel them start, talk to your doctor. 

Mine started with hearing music, and that lasted several days. It did not effect my behavior or mood (it was actually kind of nice) and if I had known it might have been caused by this drug, I would have talked to my doctor sooner.

It took over a week for it to progress to visual hallucinations. Again, they were not strong or dangerous at the time. I talked to my doctor and, because it's not considered a symptom of this drug, he suggested that it was likely either the ambien or lack of sleep, both of which can and do cause hallucinations. I do not at all fault my doctor for making this suggestion, because as of now, there is very little literature about this side effect and they are all case studies. His determination was completely valid. 

I went off ambien first to see if the symptoms got better. I got less sleep. The symptoms got worse. 

I went back on ambien. I got more sleep. The symptoms got worse. 

The last three nights(for some reason i only have light symptoms when there is light), I was pretty much in full psychosis and hallucinating so badly that I thought I would have to be hospitalized. Again, it took over two weeks for me to get to this point. Had I known to talk to my doctor about it and provide him the studies to look over when the very very light symptoms were presenting, it never would have gotten to this point.

This post is NOT to scare anyone off lamotrigine, because again, for 99.999% of people taking it, they do not get these symptoms. I'm making this post to let people know that if they start feeling these side effects, talk to your doctor immediately.",bipolar_disorder

"My whole life has changed in the matter of a few weeks. Really it started changing a year ago, but I'll get to that.

I had to leave the country and go back to my home country to go to school and get medical procedures done. All the while, my partner had moved out of state a year before I had to leave. This took a toll on me since we had to do the long distance thing again. Me leaving the country made the distance even greater and it affected the both of us.

My chosen family had become my family family. I love them with all my heart and to go from living with them for five years to not at all affected me. One day after I got to my home country I had to start school and living in a dorm. This was a bust. I was harassed at the bathrooms of the dorm and both my mental and physical health were deteriorating.

I was taken to the ER that day. I was passing out on the benches at the university and could barely walk or stand from all the pain in my legs and exhaustion. My docs in the states told me I have fibro and my aunt thinks I have lupus. I don't know what the fuck, but my body ain't working right.

After I got to the ER I had a breakdown. I panicked, started crying and was shouting out for my partner. I couldn't bear with any of that shit anymore and I just wanted to see them. After six years of being together to not be able to see them for a year I couldn't take it. I felt like everything was being ripped away from me.

After all that happened I started speaking loudly and felt unstoppable. I was on top of it all. I felt clear. My body was still not doing okay. My sleep patterns had become erratic. Soon afterwards I crashed and my body was even more nonstop exhausted and in pain.

Fast forward to this weekend I've been having a hard time getting words out. I've been trying to explain this to my friends, my partner and my family. I'm being called crazy because I'm on a different frequency than everyone else. I'm speaking truth and putting out love. The world is pushing back though. I'm fighting for my family. I'm fighting to have the ultimate family unit. My partner can bring all their other partners, that's all good.

Society silences us because they see stuff like this and automatically call us crazy. I'm saner than most. I'm just more elevated. My brain is so fast and it goes in a million directions. It's overloaded at times and I have a hard time putting stuff into words.

This world is dangerous, ppl. I feel like I'm being stalked at all times. I hear things and I look out my window and this has got to stop. One time I heard someone bang and knock at my bedroom door very loudly at 2AM. I opened the door and no one was there. People should feel safe. I don't want this. I feel like an alien who doesn't speak human at times because I tell people these things and they think I'm crazy. 

Have you taken your meds? Yessir. Every day. But that's not the point. I feel like I'd be better off living on the moon. For that and many other reasons I tried to \*\*\*\* myself a couple of months ago. I was fighting to fix the world. I put my music on Spotify. The vision is out there. Love is out there. People are loving it and I'm glad and all, but people don't see the toll it takes on you.

I made 40+ songs this year. 14 of them made it on to the final cut of the album. I tried to \*\*\*\* myself because I couldn't take it anymore. I felt like I was dirty constantly. I took a million showers and I still felt dirty. The folks at the ER when I was on \*\*\*\*\*\*\* watch had to give me a valium because I was wildin' out and in panic because I smelled things that weren't there. The world is not okay, bro. Why did life have to change so fast and so drastically?

And then folks wanna talk about psych hospitals. I've been hospitalized twice this year. There was \*\*\* on the windows of my room. There was writings on the walls. I do not want to see that shit.

I just want my life back. I want my family back. I'm being attacked for wanting things to be okay. I love people. I love hard. I love more than anyone in this world loves. I've wanted to be a mom at times, but I don't want to pass down the chronic pain and bipolar to my kids. I don't want them to hurt. I'm human in that aspect. I empathize.

I'm 27. My dream is to produce and make beats for singers and rappers. Be in the studio and just get it to where the artist goes like ""that's the stuff"". I just want to make bread for the fam. I want to be of supply. I want to be of use. I've been making music for over ten years now. I've contacted record labels with demos and early demo versions of my album. Nothing. DefJam, the Roc, G.O.O.D. Music, Warp, O.L.I...I'm here. Let's talk.

I have a young daughter and she already knows there are some days I just donâ€™t â€˜feel wellâ€™(nothing negative has ever been pointed in her direction), Iâ€™m just not sure how damaging all of this will be on our relationship and Iâ€™m scared sheâ€™ll no longer want a relationship with me at some point because of it. Is a positive relationship possible? Or any suggestions on what I could do to keep improving the relationship to avoid this?",bipolar_disorder

"Hi. So Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with bipolar for about a decade, after many years of being wrongly diagnosed with run-of-the-mill depression. 

My anxiety is through the roof. I canâ€™t keep a job and am now panicking because I need one ASAP to survive. Iâ€™m also trying to open an Etsy shop for extra income. 

I can barely job search or create my Etsy listings. My heart pounds all day and Iâ€™m just frozen, sitting around doing not much of anything. 

Iâ€™m on my 5 mg Abilify daily and I do have 0.5 mg Xanax as needed but I try to only use it when I canâ€™t sleep at night. 

I guess what Iâ€™m wondering is if any of you have learned any coping skills to get out of a rut like this. How do you move forward when you feel so terrified and frozen?",bipolar_disorder
I have manic depressive bipolar but Iâ€™ll have times Iâ€™m timid and shy and quiet. But then Iâ€™ll have other times I hate everyone and everything and donâ€™t care about anything. Everything is getting harder to deal with the more i think I feel like Iâ€™m going insane. My mind races 100 mph on Random stuff like how you could theoretically making a device to intercept neurological pathways and make a brain computer interface. Itâ€™s hard to sleep itâ€™s hard to eat. I keep thinking about people I shouldnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve rude every relationship Iâ€™ve ever been in. I donâ€™t feel anything anymore I canâ€™t differentiate feelings anymore. I just want everything to stop there is so much chaos inside my head.,bipolar_disorder
"i just got out of a pretty long manic episode.. i donâ€™t really know how long it lasted but probably at least two months. i made some choice decisions but t whatever

when the mania ends i feel like a completely different person and all of what happened is a blur. i remember stuff but itâ€™s all hazy. and i feel like i need to figure out what my personality is because i donâ€™t think iâ€™m the person i am while manic and my brain like doesnâ€™t know how to be a human anymore. especially when it comes to socializing",bipolar_disorder
"These past few months have been really hard; I had my parents violate a restraining order, had two significant friendships end (through no fault of my own), then housing insecurity (it sorted itself out).

I was literally so stressed out and had an OCD flare to the point where regular stressors felt like my heart was going to burst.

Things came to a head recently, so I called my medical team because I couldn't cope anymore and they offered to take me back  into psychiatric care. 

I didn't think I needed it because after they took me seriously, I felt like a big baby and I suddenly felt like I could cope with things again (weird, right?) Then I was brighter the next day onwards.

I thought because I'm no longer upset or stressed about things (except for the fact that I'm still experiencing random chest pains) that I was doing better, but these past couple of days I'm seeing this white dog that my boyfriend INSISTS isn't there. 

I first saw it the other night from the living room window and for some reason, I felt like I had to look a little harder to make sure it was actually there even though I was looking right at it- but I needed to be sure- so my boyfriend and I went to go look but there was no dog.

We made a joke about it but it's still concerning. 

I even saw it tonight while I was coming upstairs and I saw it from the downstairs window just running past.

I hardly ever see hallucinations straight on, they're usually in the corner of my eye and only ever present in extreme episodes, psychotic breaks or if I'm struggling with insomnia.

Usually, I see bugs or people in the corner of my eye, or sometimes hear music that isn't playing or that someone has left the TV on but it's off- but it's always in the corner of my eye.

There have been instances where things are fine and I experience hallucinations which I kinda just brushed off, but I've never been ""fine"" and seen something thar wasn't there dead on.

I'm scared.

I'm worried something is wrong or that I have early onset dementia.

My mother and her three siblings all have either Bipolar 1 or 2 and schizophrenia (on top of so many other disorders), so it made sense to my psychiatrist that I'd have psychotic features- but I'm scared.

I'm worried that my brain is dying and I'm scared to go to my medical team in case it's nothing or it IS something or that they don't believe me or that I'm wasting their time despite what they say.

Sorry for the wall, I'm scared and I don't know what to do.

I have Bipolar 1 with both rapid and psychotic features, on top of OCD and BPD. I'm on 200mg of Lamotrogine which works really well (my episodes are only little blips instead of full on life ruining) and I take quetiapine if I don't sleep or experiencing hallucinations.

My team know about my hallucinations but chalked it up to being sleep deprived (which is what happened the last time I called).",bipolar_disorder
"I was first diagnosed Bipolar in 2006. I went through the gamut of meds and came out hating psychiatrists. I decided to go without meds and seek legit professional therapy instead of throwing drugs at complex emotional problems. That worked really well for depression but mania was harder to control.

I recently had a pretty bad manic episode and entered an outpatient treatment facility. I'm on Lamotrigine now and it's working really well to handle my default hypomanic state. Thanks to everyone on the subreddit whose comments and post history helped me make that decision.

I talked to my psychiatrist about ADHD and they said we need to get the mania under control before we go after the ADHD. I'm listening to doctor's orders and I want to do some research in the mean time. 

I can generally manage my ADHD with intense energy and I'm realizing, now that I'm on a mood stabilizer, that maybe high effort isn't the best path. For people whose default is hypomania and who enjoy the high energy, do ADHD meds make you lethargic? Are you on a stimulant like Ritalin or something else? What has your experience been?",bipolar_disorder
"Hello, I'm 21 years old and I've been diagnosed for about 2 years now, I take 300 mg of quetiapine every day. I'm writing here because I'm lost. I've been in the longest fucking depressive episode and I don't know how much more I can take. My parents are splitting up, I have extreme health anxiety and poor health aand I'm balls deep in an eating disorder. I can't stop my terrifying and stupid thoughts that torture me and make every day unbearable. The only time I feel ""good"" is when I'm super drunk, high or with my boyfriend (he knows I'mbipolar but I never share my feelings with him). When he leaves I immediately feel like shit and it's worse than before. I hate this what the fuck is it, seperation issues? Like a fucking 6 year old? And why the fuck aren't my meds working? I'm on verge of crying 24/7, unstable as hell, everything reaaally pisses me off, I just want all of this to stop. Additionally the 300 mg of quetiapine cause absolutely demonic experiences when I try to fall asleep. Sorry for the pity party here but I honestly don't know what to do. My therapist told me to: eat, drink water and sleep. :))))))))) Honestly I don't even know what I want from you, I guess any interaction would be nice.",bipolar_disorder

"Everybody is different, but hereâ€™s one side of a mental illness that is so finicky and intricate itâ€™s hard to grapple with. Simple example.

When I was manic the last few months, I put my feet up on my desk at work one time. No big deal, Nobody saw. I then remember hearing non-work related people talk about â€œputting/having their feet upâ€ and losing my mind. I was NOT delusional- they really were saying these things. Thatâ€™s part of what makes mania so wild. These conversations and statements really happened. But how I INTERPRETED those things as actually being about that one incident I had, was incorrect.

Funny how such a small detail can derail aspects of our lives. I used that example to show that the majority of us are NOT crazy delusional. We really experience the things we experience, and itâ€™s important to honor that.

Itâ€™s the interpretations we choose and act on that are the problem.",bipolar_disorder

"Iâ€™m very upset right now because my pill prescriber and my doctor did not inform me that Depakote can cause PCOS (poly cystic ovarian syndrome). 

My partner and I have decided that we would like to try and conceive. Iâ€™m aware that Depakote is known to cause birth defects and we are not planning to try to conceive while I am on it, but my missed periods brought up a concern about my fertility.

Before I was placed on Depakote, my period was perfectly normal and it came every month at the same time. After being placed on Depakote, I began noticing my period becoming irregular and now itâ€™s been over 4 months since Iâ€™ve had a regular period. After a blood test, my doctor said that my hormone levels are now pointing toward a PCOS diagnosis. I have a pelvic ultrasound in a couple of weeks to determine whether or not I have it and I just recently found out that Depakote is known to cause PCOS. I am devastated!

I had my first hypomanic episode in April that lasted months and Iâ€™ve been thinking about everything I did. I dyed my hair a vibrant color. Got my nose pierced. Bought 10 books. Bought 5 pieces of art. Bought a ton of clothes. Spent 4k. Transferred colleges. Broke up with a guy about 5 times. Sent so many nudes. I got pulled over for the first time. Yelled at my step mom in front of my whole family. Ran 5 miles everyday for a month straight. Switched jobs. Made major future plans. I was extremely paranoid. I texted a bunch of old friends. I posted a lot on social media. I was diagnosed with bipolar on Thursday. Iâ€™m not fully stable yet but Iâ€™m getting ok mood stabilizers soon. This has been awful.,bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™m 25F &amp; I just recently got diagnosed w bipolar. Found out I had it by taking anxiety/depression meds &amp; mania popped itâ€™s head in, full force. Everything in my life, how I behaved, makes so much sense now. 
Iâ€™ve been on meds for the bipolar for almost two months now, this is the most â€œnormalâ€ Iâ€™ve felt in my whole life and yetâ€¦ I still feel so stuck. 
Itâ€™s like, the doctor was like â€œokay, hereâ€™s some meds and a therapist youâ€™ll talk to once a month, if your luckyâ€ &amp; now the rest is up to me and I feel, stuck, overwhelmed, lost and confused. Iâ€™m living with my mum (whoâ€™s also bipolar), jobless, no driverâ€™s license, no car, in debt. Trying to find a therapist and a psychiatrist is like pulling teeth where I live. Iâ€™ve been searching for months. Everywhere around me is either fully booked/not taking new patients, they donâ€™t take my insurance, or I just donâ€™t hear back. 
Good news is, my intrusive thoughts arenâ€™t as loud, &amp; my mania/ manic episodes are WAY easier to control. So thatâ€™s good, but thatâ€™s all I really got going for me. 
I feel like Iâ€™m so close to the brink of â€œnormalâ€, but in all reality, I donâ€™t think there ever will be a â€œnormalâ€ with bipolar. But itâ€™s manageable, right? I just donâ€™t know how to manage, and Iâ€™m struggling. Hard.",bipolar_disorder

A diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder can feel overwhelming. Learning about Bipolar Disorder, starting the proper treatment, making healthy lifestyle choices, and more will aid you in your journey.

Remember having bipolar is not your fault, and you are not broken or defective. Give yourself time and space. Be patient with yourself. It takes time to learn how to take care of yourself. You're working with a different set of rules now, and even though it's frustrating, it's better to go easy on yourself and not expect instant results. Don't focus on the actual diagnosis name (BP1 vs. BP2); the name only groups symptoms. It's not who you are, but the name of your disorder is a start to figuring out how to manage it in the future.
  
  - Be patient with yourself
    - Becoming well and staying well takes time, but you can do it!
  - Educate yourself
  - Be Self-Aware
  - Learn to accept help
  - Take one step at a time 
    - Make an appointment with a doctor 
    - Call a friend 
    - Establish a good sleep routine

"I donâ€™t know if this is something that everyone deals with to some degree, or if itâ€™s unique or more intense due to my diagnosis. But about a year ago, I started having intrusive sad thoughts. Not normal depression or feeling sad, but fixation on things/memories that make me feel sadness or regret, often things that I have no control over and cannot change. Itâ€™s like the triggers are everywhere and I canâ€™t get away from them because everything reminds me of something. Over the years I have developed a lot of coping skills and Iâ€™ve been relatively stable with mood and medication, so the fundamentals are there, but I canâ€™t stop fixating. When it happens, I feel mentally trapped in whatever memory Iâ€™m thinking of, and even with a lot of effort I canâ€™t seem to put it out of mind. Even if Iâ€™m engrossed in a task at work or at home, internally Iâ€™m still reliving whatever it is while I function. Is this a symptom of something bigger, something I should be concerned about, or will it eventually go away? Is there a name for this symptom so I can do more research?

I started Bupropion roughly around this time, but it doesnâ€™t feel to me like there is a correlation, as the timing is not an exact match and changes in dosage hasnâ€™t made things better or worse. I do have complex PTSD as a secondary condition, but while the symptoms are similar, the memories are not related to trauma. For example, feeling regret that a controlling parent got in the way of me having a relationship with an estranged older sibling, who committed suicide about 10 years ago. We didnâ€™t have a bad relationship, I never directly witnessed any major conflicts involving them, I was young and not responsible for the estrangement, and thereâ€™s also nothing I can do to change things now. But the feeling of sadness and regret and even guilt intrudes at times overwhelmingly.",bipolar_disorder

"So iâ€™ve (f22) recently started going to therapy for the first time in my life and have been seeing my current therapist for the past few months weekly. the last time we met she had suggested that i may have bipolar ( more specifically bipolar 2) and suggested i go see a psychiatrist to start meditation. naturally this is all very new to me, and since that conversation iâ€™ve picked up some books on bipolar and DBT to get a better grasp. this is all honestly very overwhelming for me and donâ€™t really know the next steps i should take. i know that iâ€™m an extremely dramatic person, and am not really sure if this diagnosis fits me, but i have experienced all the symptoms she had discussed with me.

i know ultimately itâ€™s my decision if i want to talk to a psychiatrist and get on meds, but i wanted to seek some advice from people who have been where i am right now. do you feel as if starting meds have helped you control your manic and depressed states? perhaps the pros and cons of meds from people who are are on meds, or other ways of managing your states? or just any advice you think somebody who recently was diagnosed should know?",bipolar_disorder

My psychiatrist is a VERY smart and renowned expert on bipolar. Heâ€™s the kind of guy you canâ€™t really tell shit to. Youâ€™re paying for his expert opinion. Iâ€™m worried he wonâ€™t be open to change and Iâ€™ll just be stuck taking invega with my lithium.

"I'm the bipolar part of the relationship, and I'm also on the autistic spectrum.
We've been in a relationship for 3 years, which for the most part is perfect. We get along well, we spend a lot of time together, and we're even thinking about moving in together.
But sometimes, we have some situations that make me question whether we will be able to deal with coexistence in the long term.
For example, due to my sensory sensitivity and social phobia (caused by both bipolar and autism) leaving the house can be quite challenging, but with lots of therapy and the right medication, I do it with some effort. It always involves an anxiety crisis, crying, self-esteem problems, which sometimes make me leave the house in a bad mood, but with time stabilizes, as I get used to the environment in which I will be. 
So, yesterday was one of those situations, my SO and I met at a restaurant, and I explained to him that it had been a hard time leaving home, but that everything was getting better. 
We ordered our drinks and our conidas, and I was having fun, until I realized that he was looking at me very cynically and making fun of everything I said, which made me very uncomfortable and insecure, and I ended up going into ""defense mode"", feeling the need to justify everything I was saying, and repeating myself several times, which only made him more annoyed with me.
I asked what was wrong, and the only thing he could tell me was that he couldn't do anything if I left the house in a bad mood, which is why he was being cynical and sarcastic all the time.
 I just got really annoyed with all that, I asked for the bill and we left.
I was taken by a feeling of helplessness for not having been able to de-escalate the situation, but at the same time I felt like an idiot for not having been able to realize that he was bothered before, and I also felt an absurd anger at his lack of acceptance and understanding ofmy difficulties. 
At the same time, I understand that it's not always easy to deal with the humor of a bipolar. I just wish we could talk about it without always having to be me to start the conversation.
If he had told me he was having a problem with my mood, instead of letting me believe we were fine (since I have a hard time ""reading the room""), I could have changed my behavior, or maybe rescheduled the date to a more favorable day for both of us.
I feel that much of the wear is due to the lack of dialogue.
When i got home I tÃªxteis him about everything i felt, he admitted he was annoyed, but he thought he didn't need to say anything because it would pass with time, and said that later we would talk about the general problem.
The conversation never came.
I wonder if these events, even if they are punctual, will not destroy everything when we are living together.
I wonder how to de-escalate the situation, but at the same time I wonder if I can even be in that place of rationalizing for both of us always, when sometimes I can't rationalize even for myself.
I love him, but maybe my condicionado is just too much for him to take.",bipolar_disorder
"I also just logged into my social security account out of curiosity and was surprised to see that I would only qualify for $330/month in SSDI benefits if I even got it, which is pretty much impossible anyway. I'm 25 and have been living with my parents and doing gig economy shit for spending money since I got out of high school so I guess I deserve it? And this latest psychotic break came RIGHT after completing a treatment program for depression and getting an apartment with a girl I met there. She hasn't talked to me much since the incident and I noticed when I came to get some of my stuff there were cop cars stationed near the entrance to our corner of the complex. 

When I got to the door she did that thing where you leave it chained while opening it and had this *look* in her eyes. I didn't do anything heinous, I just thought I was going to change the world and was dancing/walking and around the apartment grounds with headphones on and saying a bunch of nonsensical things which I guess is scary for other people, but I mean they weren't the ones who were lifted off the ground by some tiny dick rent-a-cop while handcuffed and having their arm twisted behind their back and dumped into a cold concrete box to spend the night in. She politely asked me to leave for at least 10 days so she could ""process"", whatever that fuck that means.

I've pretty much accepted that whatever we had is gone now and as soon as I get out of this latest residential treatment center I've been funneled into I'll probably be taking my shit back to my parents house, and my dad is a fairly severe alcoholic so that's always fun. Oh, and since he moved our family across the country for a job when I was 10 my parents are literally the only family I have here, though I have two friends left from high school. Two months ago while my grandpa was dying he impulsively told his bosses he wouldn't be renewing his contract in February and is going to move back to the south where he's originally from.

"Hi everyone, Iâ€™ve been debating making this because I feel very vulnerable but I feel like I need some support or reassurance. I also got diagnosed a year ago this month and I have not had a major manic episode since. Iâ€™m going to explain both how Iâ€™m feeling in general and about this crush so you hopefully get the whole picture. 

Context:
Recently I (23) met a guy, letâ€™s call him C (25). C and I met randomly and exchanged numbers, we then got together a week later for drinks and dinner, then went to a second bar where his friend joined. We seemed to get along well and I find him really attractive. The second time we got together C, a different friend of his, and I went out and then C and I ended up kissing where he asked me back to his place. We ended up staying up until 7 am, I really didnâ€™t feel tired at all. I went back to my place and slept for a few hours but I felt giddy. 

He is rarely on his phone so we never texted much but since last week I added him on snap and heâ€™s messaged me more there. Part of it could be because I feel more comfortable texting him now, and maybe part of it is bc he wants to talk to me? 

My issues(?) 
I can fall for someone quickly, I feel like I always have and I feel like that leads to me being heart broken because I fall fast and either they donâ€™t, or I see sides of them I donâ€™t like. Iâ€™m not sure if falling quickly is a part of bipolar/mania, or just abandonment and other issues I may have. So the reason Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™m possibly going manic, I am barely sleeping, I get a few hours but I donâ€™t feel tired and then I wake up and I feel okay. I can feel a little groggy at first I suppose but once I wake up even if itâ€™s only been 4 hours of sleep I cannot go back to sleep, I find myself thinking about C, and ultimately I start my day and I feel wide awake. Iâ€™m barely sleeping, I have an elevated mood, Iâ€™m feeling more confident (but that could also be bc Iâ€™m working out, looking healthier, and got a new job), I am getting more snappy with my mom, and I randomly finally got the urge to start cleaning my room after months of letting things pile up, little things like that. Again, I was diagnosed a year ago, so while Ik I have had mania I donâ€™t know my personal symptoms of it starting, I know what I listed are common ones and things I felt when I was manic before, but also symptoms of a crushâ€¦?

(TW SA)
My biggest manic episode I was partying constantly, sleeping around with anyone anywhere. I easily crossed double digits in a month. During this I still never liked staying in bed with someone right away, and then I was SAed which made me rarely stay with someone else. I then got a SO of a few years but he moved states and things fizzled. I find myself thinking back to the first few dates because idk it just felt, easy? Natural? Which I think keeps me up at night. I normally do not spend an entire night curled up in someoneâ€™s bed unless I know them REALLY well because of my trauma so it was a shock to me I felt okay to. 

I guess my point, and questions are, 1. Could this be mania starting making me feel so strongly about C or is constantly thinking ab him is keeping me up and making me feel good not mania and just a crush? 2. How do I tell him I have bipolar and when? We are not official and idk if we will be. He said he was kind of in his hoe phase but like I said weâ€™re texting more despite how he doesnâ€™t like to be on his phone and heâ€™s having me over tonight which he normally doesnâ€™t do so he says bc he has an office job. Heâ€™s a smooth talker and has confidence so idk if itâ€™s just sex or more because we do hang out too but itâ€™s only been a few dates. I feel like now is possibly too early but I want him to know before we start dating if we do, because I feel like Iâ€™d be deceptive if I donâ€™t tell him until after weâ€™re in a relationship. 

Thank you for reading this :)",bipolar_disorder
"I go to the gym and feel better very briefly. Very depressed right now. Ive been on a waitlist for about 6 months to see someone at the behavioral place. I havenâ€™t been on meds for a while because i just want to die so i forgot about them. which is kinda funny idk why. Sleep schedule is fucked.

I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m truly unhappy with my life or my brain is trying to convince me I am.

"I think this is just me spewing out my thoughts, trying to make sense of what's going on internally. Any insight would be helpful.

TL;DR - I think I'm rapid cycling after the death of a loved one but don't know enough to be able to say for sure. I've never experienced this particular flavor of grief before. 

My grandma just passed a few days ago. This has been my first loss since being diagnosed in March and I feel absolutely bewildered. I'm unmedicated (need to pay off my bill from the dx before I can resume seeing my psychiatrist), but through therapy I've managed to find a fairly stable ""zen mode"". That is, until this week. I still don't fully understand my bipolar, but I think I'm rapid cycling?

My emotions have been anywhere from the expected tears at her passing and regret that I didn't spend more time with her these last few years. In some points I'm relieved because the stress of her failing health has eaten at me. I feel fine about it other times, almost as though I've already been through the grief cycle and have healed (not true). But then this morning I had what might be a hypomania? This feeling of elation and excitement after rediscovering a love of monster movies that we shared when I was young. It made me feel guilty, like I'm behaving like her death set me free? A few minutes later, though, I started randomly crying for what feels like no reason (it wasn't even a sad ""I'm gonna miss her"" cry). Underneath it all has been this pervasive depression; not even a mood per sÃ© but that lack of energy, sex drive, will to live, etc. 

I have some comorbidities, including CPTSD. I have no idea what's causing this instability or how to deal with it. Is this normal bipolar shit that other people can relate to, or are my autism and/or ADHD throwing wrenches in the mix? How much suppressed trauma is driving this? I feel so lost. I just want to be able to grieve and go back to fixing my life from a neutral ground.",bipolar_disorder

"Hi everyone.   I have been lurking.  First time posting on this reddit. Back story..  I was diagnosed with bipolar 17 years ago.  I got on the right medication right away but way too much.  I was on 40 mg of olanzapine and 750 of divalproex.   I was weened off olanzapine to 2.5 mg.  In Feb I went to a new psychiatrist because I kind of lost it on my boss at work. I was really upset.  Looking back yes, I was emotional but, because I have bipolar I immediately thought there was something wrong with me.  I have been at the same company for 13 years.  I am really good at my job mainly because I have been a manager for 7 years.  I never had issues with any of my bosses until now (8 in total). I have been a manager for  8 years.  So this psychiatrist decides since I'm on divalproex anyways she'll take me off Olanzapine.  Ya I'm emotional so take me off olanzapine and don't give me anything in place of it.  Well that didn't go well.  I turned into an angry negative person.  However, still functional. Last week I didn't sleep at all.  I was a mess by Friday.  Luckily I had a doctor appointment already scheduled due to the stress at work.  He has put me back on olanzapine 5 mg.  I'm already feeling a bit better but I'm off work for at least a month until it is regulated again.  I have to tell you though my boss has not been very good.  She just kept dumping more work on me even though I was noticeably stressed out and at one point even said I was overwhelmed.   I honestly thought she was a friend but looking back I think she actually would like it if I left for good.  Anyway, I am at a company that believes strongly in mental health.  There's one plus.  I am feel pretty sad about this whole situation.   I worked so hard to get where I am.  I will still have my job when I go back.  I am really nervous about how thats going to look in November.

"So after being diagnosed, I was referred to my nearest trusts psych therapy team to seek to receive some form of talking therapy alongside my medication. 

Upon receiving contact from them I was told there could be a lengthy wait until I was received. (What I understood to be the notorious dreaded waiting list for those seeking government funded services)

Iâ€™ve discovered after months of waiting that after this wait the calls I have had this week, were merely the assessments for the psych team to evaluate my needs and potential treatment they could offer (similar assessment to what I feel Iâ€™ve had to go through a few times already with other sectors Iâ€™ve spoken to over the period of my diagnosis and liaison with doctors) and have been told Iâ€™m only now on the 8-10 month waiting list to receive therapy! 

Obviously this is a bit disheartening to say the least, although I understand this is very common for everyone seeking this type of help. 

Does anyone have any experience in this situation and can confirm this estimation time of being on the waiting list? 
Iâ€™m also considering looking in to potential private therapy options, but Iâ€™ve heard these can be very expensive, if anyone can give me an idea of the type of money this can cost from experience and whether or not this speeds up the process a bit I would appreciate it!

"I 35F just ended things with the guy 36M I was dating for a few months. For context, Iâ€™m BP1 medicated, and according to him heâ€™s also bipolar as diagnosed by either a psychologist or psychiatrist (he canâ€™t recall) but he doesnâ€™t believe it and he doesnâ€™t take meds. I met him through online dating, and when we finally saw each other, he turns out to be morbidly obese as in 300plus pounds, walks really slowly, and sometimes heâ€™d need assistance from some guy heâ€™d hire to help him walk (this guy was also his backup driver). At first I thought I could live with his physical state, because it seemed we could carry a conversation, heâ€™s smart, self employed and driven, and he seemed interested in me at the start. Unfortunately, I noticed that when I would seek small forms of support from him through chat (we couldnâ€™t meet so frequently as he claims heâ€™s busy with work and other stuff), heâ€™d just reply with one word answers or sometimes just have no reaction. This happened even when i said I wasnâ€™t feeling well. He kept saying heâ€™s busy and he replies like that to friends and clients. I said that we donâ€™t see each other so often, so i was hoping weâ€™d make up for it through chat. I wasnâ€™t unreasonable, I didnâ€™t demand for him to reply asap or anything like that. Heck, I didnâ€™t even hound him with missed calls and the like. I was also willing to overlook the lack of physical intimacy due to his obesity, if he would have been a little more caring and supportive. Finally I decided that I wasnâ€™t okay with so little. I did check my mood as well. I also talked to someone I trusted before i decided that it would be better to end things. Maybe he has his own issues that he canâ€™t resolve. I really donâ€™t know.

Sheâ€™s been leaning heavily on alcohol to cope with her self hatred and just social anxiety I guess. 

I donâ€™t deal with any mental health issues myself and thatâ€™s always been a struggle of understanding between us. 

Thereâ€™s also hints of self mutilation and suicide. If Iâ€™m being honest a lot of it tends to stem when sheâ€™s drinking heavily. Iâ€™ve tried to have real honest talks about it, and I consistently get the â€œIâ€™m working on itâ€
No matter the circumstances. 

Weâ€™ve been dating for 13 years, married for 5. I truly believe she is the partner for me and the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. Iâ€™ve been trying my best to not take things personally and to be extremely patient. 

But the real reason Iâ€™m writing is because she now seems to think that an open relationship is going to be the answer to her problems. Sheâ€™s the type of person who loathes for attention. We had a honest conversation where I told her I was fine with her flirting and getting attention from guys online. As long as there were no naked pics, can sex. Or anything physical. Weâ€™ll as you can guess I recently discovered she was sending pictures and having phone sex and cam sex with guys online. I just donâ€™t know where to turn

Itâ€™s just not the amazing person I married, and I know sheâ€™s in there somewhere. And Iâ€™m just stubborn enough to try to continue to make it work. Should I continue to wait this out until she settles into this mere mental illness? I might be selfish saying this but she continue to use it as her only excuse, and I canâ€™t seem to get an honest answer when I ask why she wants any open relationship.

I wanted to try the new mystery Mountain Dew so I went to the gas station to pick one up very late at night/early in the morning. 

Outside of the gas station there was a gentleman who commented on my Dragonball shirt with baby Goku on it and told me how much he liked the series and grew up watching it. I thought he wanted to talk anime so on my way out he stopped me and asked if I had a minute. 

He was homeless and hadnâ€™t taken his meds for 2 months. He wanted a ride and I said no, because that is unsafe but as someone with severe bipolar 1 my heart felt for the guy. He didnâ€™t know what town he was in, and told me he had the mentality of a 14 year old. He asked if I could ever come visit him again the gas station and I hesitantly said maybe sometime knowing that wasnâ€™t the case.

"bro I'm kind of tweaking I've for sure dealt with this before but I fear this time it's exacerbated by drug use lol

I'm drunk as hell rn and currently feeling peaceful but I was NOT earlier

I'm not kidding... I legitimately was about to bolt right downstairs and start yelling at my parents and shit. LIke I remember getting into a thought loop where I **felt** like I was a demon sent down to punish my parents for being abusive. Crazy shit but I was so wildly angry at the time that it made perfectly rational sense. I wasn't gonna hurt them or anything I had the intention of getting kicked out and honestly I really really just wanted to piss them off, I was just gonna like yell at them and say unhinged ass shit though I'm not really built for violence unless it's in self defense or defense of others, even when I'm wildly angry like that I'm more likely to hurt myself. Unless my dad started the fight or touched me I'd probably deck him at that point. But again literally self defense just very fun self defense.

I've almost.. Sobered up more? It's hard to explain I'm drunk and still ""manic"" like as you can see I'm still pissed I'm just sleepy and like I can almost peer into my head and see the rational part. And the rational part says ""don't fuckin go downstairs stay in ur room"" and y'know what I think I'm gonna do that man

anyway idk if you have any thoughts go for it, any tips or something. I've dealt with mania when I was 14 and while it's definitely exacerbated by the drugs (pretty sure the ima fuckin demon shit was related to my hallucinogen use lol) this is all stuff I've felt before. Feels natural and ""deserved"" honestly. Anyway I wasn't responsible when I was 14, and **won't** be responsible now but idk I might be a little more... negotiable now. Idk I'm drunk so right now it's totally different, it's like I'm both manic and non manic. When I sober up I'm sure ima get a hangover and get really pissed about it. Solution: probably 2 keep drinking man I mean honestly... haven't felt this good in years.

also side note idk how to label this because I can say for certain ***right now*** I am not engaging in unsafe behavior.

"Women who have been diagnosed with bipolar 1/2, how did you go about deciding if you were to have children or not. Those of which did choose to have children, how did you go about it? Did you have medication changes, what was your support network like, how was the pregnancy and the birth and did you have issues after?

a)you have bipolar

b) you like dark comedy

c) you come to enjoy a weird laugh of British humour and mostly laugh about life since you have mental illness too ðŸ¤¯ðŸ˜±

d) all of the above

There is a particular kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror involved in this kind of madness. When you're high it's tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars, and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones. Shyness goes, the right words and gestures are suddenly there, the power to captivate others a felt certainty. There are interests found in uninteresting people. Sensuality is pervasive and the desire to seduce and be seduced irresistible. Feelings of ease, intensity, power, well-being, financial omnipotence, and euphoria pervade one's marrow. But, somewhere, this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast, and there are far too many; overwhelming confusion replaces clarity. Memory

Everything previously moving with the grain is now against-- you are irritable, angry, frightened, uncontrollable, and enmeshed totally in the blackest caves of the mind. You never knew those caves were there. It will never end, for madness carves its own reality.

"Hello, I have cyclothymia and BPD. I have tried many mood stabilizers and it seems that the Tegretol (carbamazepine) works best in terms of mixed episodes, mood liability and impulse control. It feels unbearably boring but when I am calm and nothing much is going on I can eventually start working on myself. Lamotrigine doesnt do the trick - to me, it doesnt help much with hypomanic episodes. I really want to become stable so as to find my own hobby and move forward with career. Is it possible to keep up to an optimal weight while on the Tegretol? I tried this drug for a month and gained a bunch of kilos while on it, the extra weight shed off once I discontinued it.

"Hey y'all, 

TLDR: I take 1500mg of divalproex/depakote a day and it is causing awful stomach problems, anyone experienced this? Tips to make it less bad?

So I've been taking divalproex (depakote if your american) since april. Until mid august I had been taking it with olanzapine (which is known to reduce the stomach problems). I had no stomach issues while taking it with olanzapine. I stopped the olanzapine because it made me gain 25lbs in 3 months. Then I had a period of stupidity where I basically wasn't taking them for a month after having been at a dose of 2000mg per day. 

Now I'm back at a dose of 1500mg per day (500 in morning 1000 at night) and am having terrible stomach issues (indigestion, diarrhea etc.).  For reference I'm a 6 foot tall 140lbs guy, 1500mg seems quite high to me for my size, but my psych seems to know his shit pretty well so I trust it. Does anyone have any tips/tricks to alleviate the stomach problems, pepto bismol isn't cutting it. I was having the stomach problems at lower doses as well, just not as bad.",bipolar_disorder

I'm 25 and have been living with my parents and doing gig economy shit for spending money since I got out of high school so I guess I deserve it? And this latest psychotic break came RIGHT after completing a treatment program for depression and getting an apartment with a girl I met there. She hasn't talked to me much since the incident and I noticed when I came to get some of my stuff there were cop cars stationed near the entrance to our corner of the complex. When I got to the door she did that thing where you leave it chained while opening it and had this *look* in her eyes. I didn't do anything heinous, I just thought I was going to change the world and was dancing/walking and around the apartment grounds with headphones on and saying a bunch of nonsensical things which I guess is scary for other people, but I mean they weren't the ones who were lifted off the ground by some tiny dick rent-a-cop while handcuffed and having their arm twisted behind their back and dumped into a cold concrete box to spend the night in. She pretty much wanted me to leave for 10 days so she could ""process"", whatever that fuck that means.

"hi, iâ€™ve been kinda learning how to use reddit now and recently have been diagnosed with bipolar 2. Iâ€™m 15 and wanted to get some advice with how to cope with manic episodes and live day to day life, but i saw that some people have shared their experiences with psychosis and sorta think iâ€™ve been dealing with similar stuff.

iâ€™ve been basically going to therapy as a 9 years old and recently have gotten off, but my therapist mentioned i wasnâ€™t showing signs of psychosis before she left and i was sorta confused. a lot of people experiences has been similar to mine and im worried that iâ€™ve been dealing with this for a long time now.

since i was 12, i always had this really bad irrational fear that there was always someone in my closet waiting for me to fall asleep so they could kill me, i always told myself it was fake and i shouldnt believe in dumb stuff like that but i was still scared. every night i would check my closet and room with a baseball bat because i was terrified of what would happen if i let my guard down. i swore i heard voices and movements coming from the closet and had this belief that they could watch me with some advanced technology and iâ€™ve lost countless hours of sleep because of that. at some point i stopped sleeping for a few day and would roam around my house at 4 am with a weapon because i thought my family would die if i didnâ€™t protect them. sometimes i would spends hours watching my parents sleep because i was utterly horrified that they would be brutally killed if i couldnâ€™t protect them. 

this lasted for several months until the august of next year, so nov 2019 to august 2020 i believe. 

i donâ€™t really recall any similar experiences like this one, but subconsciously i know itâ€™s happened again more recently but i just canâ€™t remember. am i dealing with psychosis or something else entirely?

"Tw: suicide ideation

I can only remember seriously contemplating suicide once in my life. I was seven years old and standing in the kitchen. I was holding the chefâ€™s knife my mom used for slicing meat. I wasnâ€™t sure exactly how to do it, but I thought if I bled enough Iâ€™d be dead.

I liked playing video games as a kid with my younger brothers. I remember thinking how this was real, and I wouldnâ€™t be able to come back afterwards. I wouldnâ€™t get a restart like in the video games. So I put the knife back in the drawer.

I know I was seven years old because the next month my family and I went to see a Disney movie in theaters that was theatrically released when I was seven. I liked that movie a lot. After we got home and I was sitting in my room, I felt glad that I hadnâ€™t killed myself a month ago. Because if I had been dead I would have missed getting to watch it, and it had been a really nice movie.

I would get bullied at school for behaving weird and not understanding things. I would get ridiculed by my mom for being sensitive about getting picked on in school. I just thought it would be nice to escape all of that. I never mentioned it to my parents, because I knew my mom would criticize me or say it was for attention. Also, I didnâ€™t want her to know, because then I might not get another chance when I needed to escape.

Time passed and I continued to have periods in my life growing up where I considered giving up. But then Iâ€™d remind myself how I might miss something cool after I died, like the movie I got to see when I was seven because I decided to try living a little longer.

I had been having a six-year on-again-off-again affair, which was exposed in the late summer of 2021. This sent me into a terrible spiral, along with my wife, and I was hospitalized after attempting to slit my wrists and run away that September. As a result of my hospitalization I was prescribed Zoloft for depression. The whole experience was defined as ""situational."" I was set up with a therapist for ongoing care, and discharged after a few days._x000D_
_x000D_
Little did I know what the next year would be like. A series of highs and lows. Whenever my wife would talk to me about the affair I would spiral out of control, feel like running away or just ending my life to get away from this terrible feeling of what I have done, and feeling like what I did was irredeemable. I love my wife. I love my family. I want to make it work. However I kept going into these ""shame spirals"" and saying mean things, unable to control my ""tantrums"" and later regretting what I said and wishing I could take it back, but what's said is said, right? And now there's more stuff out there that I can never take back. I just kept piling more and more guilt on myself._x000D_

Well here we are, just over a year later, and finally I have a diagnosis of bipolar. Finally something makes sense. I can remember having episodes of being unbelievably rude to my siblings, driving like a maniac when things didn't go my way, etc. And I can see how many disagreements I had with my wife would escalate into these uncontrollable yelling sessions where I said things I wished I could take back. So it seems like I've been bipolar for as long as I can remember. And it's likely that my prescription for Zoloft made this recovery year even worse, and almost impossible. Hopefully a change in meds will help me to be a better man, husband, and father. I know I have a lot of making up to do._x000D_

"Hope everyone is having a nice day :)

I've been seeing a lot of threads on here lately about being suicidal and I wanted to share my story; because I hate seeing other people feel hopeless and for the most part, I've been able to work through those feelings. For anyone that needs to hear it today: ***You Matter, Your Life Is Worth Living and There Is Always Hope for a Better Future!*** 

First and foremost, if you need it, **please seek professional help!** Without some of the wonderful providers I've had, I don't think I would have made it to this point. In my experience, I needed both therapy and medication management. I would recommend to anyone struggling you see both a psychiatrist and therapist. There is no shame in doing so! If you can't see a therapist for any reason, whether it be financial, or you're just not comfortable doing so, [NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) is a terrific resource](https://nami.org/About-NAMI). 

I'll try to be detailed, but I don't think digging into my early life is as important as my recovery. If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask away.

I went through a lot of trauma going up. My parents divorced when I was young and I never had a stable home life. My family was and still is, extremely toxic. It's kind of off topic, but for anyone struggling with conflict with their family, one of the best pieces of advice I've ever received is ""*You don't get to choose your blood, but you do get to choose your family*"". 

All of my problems started to come to a head when I got out of high school. My life lost what little structure it had. I didn't know at the time, but that structure was my stability hanging on by a thread. I refused to seek help; I didn't want it and I didn't think I needed it. Instead, I started coping with substances. I was spiraling and about a year after graduating, when I was 19, I wound up in the mental hospital.  It was there where I received my diagnosis of Bipolar 1.

For me, my rock bottom and turning point was just about 5 years ago (End of September 2017). I nearly made the irreversible mistake of completing the act. I spent 3 days in the hospital and 13 days in the mental hospital. 

***So what changed?*** 

1. I became open to the idea that I could be helped and get better. Accepting that I needed professional help and there was nothing wrong with that, was huge for me. I stuck with going to therapy and taking my medications consistently. *I cannot stress enough how important medication has been for treating my mental health issues.* 
2. I stopped using any drugs, or alcohol, until I was stable.
3. I stopped isolating myself. Sometimes it's still tough, but forcing myself to go and experience life was very important to breaking the cycle. 
4. I learned to live in the present. Your past doesn't necessarily define your future. Reliving trauma by dwelling, or being anxious about the future (outside of therapy) was not conducive to me being a happy person. By living in the present, I found moments of happiness.
5. I gave myself reasons to live; whether it was finish a tattoo, for my dogs, or out of spite. It got me through some really tough times.
6. Last, but not least, I realized **my life matters**. Even though it didn't matter to me at first and I had a hard time feeling like it did to other people, I knew that was in my head. Around the time I had got out of the mental hospital, one of my friends growing up took their life and I saw how it devastated so many people. I refused traumatize the people who have loved me at any point, or to leave behind my amazing, super clingy animals. 

If someone had told in my late teens, or early twenties that I would be alive 7 years later, let alone excited and planning for my 26th birthday, I wouldn't have believed them. I get what it's like to not have the will to live, but really what do you have to lose by giving life a chance? You never know what the future holds :)",bipolar_disorder

Sheâ€™s putting me on a third mood stabilizer and wants me to go to the hospital until I can become stable again. This is fucking destroying me. I am so busy and donâ€™t want to take off the work to do this but I know I need to. 

What all do they do in a partial program? Iâ€™ve only ever been fully inpatient and honestly didnâ€™t have a great experience.",bipolar_disorder
"Recently, I moved back in with my fam and thereâ€™s veryyy easy access to alcohol and w**d. Iâ€™ve been binge drinking/sm*king a lot, in a way I havenâ€™t done in a while. And I donâ€™t necessarily think Iâ€™m hypomanic.

Iâ€™ve still been doing pretty well each day (not depressed), but I was thinking about stopping my antidepressants (not my antipsychotic) so Iâ€™ll feel super sad and associate that with drinking. Or is that just crazy? Idk what to do really, I just donâ€™t want this to continue.

More generally, any advice for how to limit drinking/sm*king in an environment where itâ€™s all over the place?

"No body takes me seriously.

When I attempted suicide, the only recovery option was staying in the psych ward.

I have never skipped a day of meds, not even when Iâ€™m seriously drunk. I take them every night and Iâ€™m still depressed.

Family friends and even my own family mocked my unemployment.

When I told my friend I attempted suicide, he called me a coward and told me I should do it.

The same friend also belittled my appearances and failure at school and work.

I canâ€™t afford to see a clinical psychologist. But thatâ€™s what I desperately need.

"That I could explain to non-bipolar people what a 24/7 job it is to have bipolar disorder. Having to accommodate your mental illness in every single aspect of your life. Being hyper vigilant is mandatory. Every thought, every action, requires analysis, because god forbid it means youâ€™re shifting into an episode. Canâ€™t be too sad, or itâ€™s depression. Canâ€™t be too happy, itâ€™s mania. Weird thought? Fuck, am I have delusions, am I psychotic? Gotta socialize, but not too much. Have good self esteem, but not that good cuz grandeur. Gotta have hobbies, but donâ€™t get *too* into them. Watch every penny you spend. And most important of all, make sure no one else *ever* feels any of your symptoms.

"I was diagnosed bipolar type 1 two months ago at age 25, after a lifetime of knowing *something* was wrong, but never really being sure what as I avoided therapy (it's the \~PTSD dual diagnosis\~). I had always just assumed I had depression with some periods of feeling better I now realize were often hypomania, and was eventually diagnosed after I started having full-blown manic episodes this year. I'm now on week six of a treatment program, taking Geodon and Wellbutrin, and after an early-treatment emotional roller coaster including several horrible depression days in a row, I'm finally feeling much better today-- my illness feels more manageable, I feel more confident in my ability to recover, and I'm starting to get enjoyment out of things again. And after feeling so horrible, it's an incredible relief to feel like this.

But now that I know my diagnosis, I'm paranoid that I'm actually feeling manic instead of happy, and that I'm not supposed to feel like this, and this is just another symptom flare-up/way that my recovery is going wrong. I'm scared to tell my psych I'm feeling better because I'm scared she'll tell me it's mania and try to medicate it out of me. I don't feel particularly manic, but I can't stop second-guessing my suddenly improved mood, especially when my actual situation hasn't really changed.

Itâ€™s probably confirmed that Iâ€™m likely bipolar 2. For me to feel such agitation and fear (not anxiety) itâ€™s weird, itâ€™s more a deep fear or something very dark coming over me - Iâ€™ve decided to drop it back. 

I imagine Iâ€™ll feel better tension wise but probably have a drop into a low mood. Only three weeks on this so perhaps it wonâ€™t be so bad.",bipolar_disorder

I'm not fully manic but I just spent money on something I didn't really NEED, just really wanted it. I haven't even finished paying off my phone yet and I'm over here spending money like I'm rich.

# Half the battle: My story of bipolar disorder in an already sober world

December 12, 2017  [David Rindone](https://www.beaconlens.com/author/davidrindone/)  [Mental Health](https://www.beaconlens.com/category/mental-health/), [Recovery](https://www.beaconlens.com/category/recovery/), [Stigma](https://www.beaconlens.com/category/stigma/)  [13 Comments](https://www.beaconlens.com/half-the-battle-my-story-of-bipolar-disorder-in-an-already-sober-world/#comments)

*ðŸ“·**April 2011. Itâ€™s late afternoon, and my second day of the Partial Program at Beverly Hospital has wrapped up. Iâ€™m plowing down Route 128 with a song on the radio that I donâ€™t remember. Everything has changed, but Iâ€™m not totally sure if thatâ€™s a good or bad thing. I pull over into the parking lot of the Liberty Tree Mall, just trying to absorb the information Iâ€™ve been given. Iâ€™ve spent so many years of my youth hanging out in this very location, and I can see the sign for Laser Quest over the highway, along with a cut-rate movie house. Traffic passes. Itâ€™s 4:00 p.m. and I call my wife with the news.*

As it turns out, my official diagnosis of bipolar II wasnâ€™t exactly a surprise to her. In fact, it was as if I suddenly announced I was right-handed. I presented the news to a test group of hand-picked familiars (a former supervisor, a friend of my son, coworkers from a side job I still do from time-to-time) and each reacted like I was telling them there would be a World Series in October. With a solid network of support in place, the big question was â€¦ now what?

I was already comfortably sober for some time and had no plans on going back. The AA community, sponsors, 12-Step Work, etc. were a fantastic resource, but this was a different animal. One of my favorite sayings is *â€œYou donâ€™t connect the dots in the futureâ€,* and I can now see my road to this point was paved by a string of major life changes in a very short amount of time. Having some family history with the disorder added fuel to the fire, and it was gently suggested that my time before sobriety was most certainly self-medicating.

**What you see isnâ€™t necessarily what is there**

After running the gauntlet on different prescribed pharmaceuticals, a nurse practitioner suggested Lithium, and it had an almost immediate effect. I began to feel better, even under some very challenging circumstances. As I still do now, I found solace and stability in the simple act of work. Iâ€™ve usually had some kind of side or second job, and I happened upon two that seem intentionally designed for someone like me. In a coincidental twist of career trajectory, I ended up in the Member Services DepartmentÂ at Beacon Health Options, my logic being who better to assist people with behavioral health and substance use disorders?

&gt;***If I appear a little down, itâ€™s not always depression. If I look like Iâ€™m lonely, that may be my introverted side showing. In short, look at the person, not the affliction.***

In the meantime, itâ€™s safely under control and manageable. Honestly, most of the time I forget Iâ€™m one of a massive population of Americans with the disorder. It can be deceptively tricky at times as I have to be aware of racing thoughts, obsessive searches for insignificant items, rapid speech, etc. On the flip side, if I appear a little down, itâ€™s not always depression. If I look like Iâ€™m lonely, that may be my introverted side showing. In short, look at the person, not the affliction.

Of course, some have the disorder much worse than I; otherwise I wouldnâ€™t be â€œoutingâ€ myself in such a sweeping gesture. I find strength in my family, loyal friends, like-minded social media people, colleges, and past and present advocates, ranging from Red Sox great Jimmy Piersal, Patty Duke, Richard Dreyfuss, Carrie Fisher, A.J. Lee and Russell Brand. Stamp out Stigma is also a fantastic source for mental illness support, and there have been several accurate and positive portrayals in film and television.

If someone asks me about it and I answer in the affirmative, Iâ€™ll usually joke that weâ€™re out there, you just have to look. And never be afraid to ask for help.",bipolar_disorder
"I recently saw a psychiatrist for the first time in ten years. I made an appointment for ADHD but she was way more concerned about my bipolar disorder. She asked me multiple times if I had seen or heard things that werenâ€™t really there. I told her no, but Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about that question for the last couple weeks. 

First, within the last month or so I have been seeing movement out of the corner of my eye but nothing was there when I looked. It was never anything specific and I have two cats so I figured it was just them or a floater in my eye.

I told my parents about the questions and reassured them I did not have hallucinations. Just the normal trick of they eye when driving at night. You know when youâ€™re driving at night and it looks like an animal or person is by the edge of the road but itâ€™s really just a shadow or illusion. They both told me that was not normal. 

Then there are the night terrors. Several many years back right after I moved out on my own I had some really vivid night terrors. And even within the last year or two Iâ€™ve had a couple waking nightmares. 

I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m over analyzing or if I should say something to my doctor. I really donâ€™t want to blow a few nightmares and optical illusions out of proportion. I would also say Iâ€™m a pretty mild case, I donâ€™t really struggle day to day. The new mood stabilizers are helping a lot. But Iâ€™ve been doing fine for the last ten years.",bipolar_disorder
"Okay so I tried going into a psych hospital because Iâ€™m obviously manic. I sleep once every 3 days, I blew through all my money, and I believe I need to become pregnant to carry the messiahâ€™s son. So, Iâ€™m having unprotected sex with as many people as possible. This started a week ago and Iâ€™ve already had sex with 13 people. I have an IUD that the voices are telling me to remove it so I can become pregnant. Itâ€™s currently my plan to do this.

I tried going to both psych hospitals in the area and they both rejected me. So what do I do? Do I contact my outpatient psychiatrist again? Do I contact my case worker through my insurnace? Do I ask my therapist to validate?",bipolar_disorder
"As soon as I start feeling really well something will interrupt that balance and Iâ€™m back on the hamster wheel again. Itâ€™s like trying to regain control of a rudderless ship at times.

Birthdays, moving house, family visitsâ€¦ whatever it is any disruption in routine fucks me up. God itâ€™s annoying. 

Anybody else find a routine change really impacts your moods and makes it difficult to get back to feeling normal?",bipolar_disorder
"Just wondering if anyone else has heard this song. Iâ€™m not usually a pop girlie, but Iâ€™ve never heard a song about post-manic kind of regret and reflection. I think it was really great and so nice to hear in mainstream media.",bipolar_disorder
Life has been so crazy lately and I forgot to set my reminder for this month to change out my birth control ring. I fucked up so bad and now its been 2 weeks. I'm just feeling out of control and I'm worried about spiraling into an episode and making everything worse. I'm trying to distract myself but nothing helps i just keep crying. Does anyone have techniques for calming down? I just don't want to self harm again I've been doing so well.,bipolar_disorder
" Okay, so I've been doing good for a while. Talked to my mom about the semi-abusive delusions she had tried to force on me. She said sorry. I went on a trip and ran a half marathon. It went pretty well.

I have a daily system where I exercise a lot, have very controlled sleep, and am very careful about getting my work done (I spiral really easily if I feel like I'm falling behind, trauma thing). Also no porn and some other stuff.

But it's really hard to keep that system going when I'm working full-time. It's too easy to get an avoidance high from looking at the 2-hour block I set aside for going for a run, feel anxious and exhausted, and say ""fuck you stability"". And when I don't exercise (half a trauma thing, half just how exercise works) I get really depressive really fast.

So I've had a shitty couple of days. Makes me scared I won't be able to ever handle a 9-5 job (which is not my long-term plan, but we don't get there without going through here).

I think it'll be okay. I'm starting some sensory therapy stuff which is already helping A LOT, and I've had good convos with my friends about this, and I haven't like screaming at someone at work or anything like that.

But it's hard having a bunch of bad days after a bunch of good ones. Makes me feel cheated.

Anyway, thanks to anyone who read this far. If you have any coping skills (dbt ones especially) please post them. Or just supportive messages, that works for me too.",bipolar_disorder
"I'm bipolar 1 and have been since I was sixteen. I'm 23 now and had a recent hospital stay because of severe depression. After the hospital, I got depressed again but I added a medication and it was fine. I was manic for a few days in the hospital after the depression but that was the first time I'd been manic in months. It seems that the last six months have been dominated by depression whereas I used to only get very manic every few weeks with a slight depression here and there. That was my pattern for years. It seems that the pattern is switching from recurring mania to recurring depression. Has this happened to anyone else? Is this the way the illness works as you get older?",bipolar_disorder

"This drug has been really hard on me,however I do not mean to deter people from taking it,this is just my experience.

It's incredible that this drug is called a mood stabilizer when in reality it is a mood assasin,it numbed me,made me incapable of acting the way I feel,I'm happy there's no hypomania or depression,but it's sad to think we aren't allowed to feel at a normal degree.It's always all or nothing,it would be amazing if we could just be free to feel,and not made out to be crazy if we dont align with their perspectives of what healthy is, I know there is no magic pill to cure us,but lithium shouldn't be sold like one either.",bipolar_disorder

"I was trying to explain my experience with mental illness to a friend of mine, who does not experience chronic mental illness.  Recipe for disaster, right?    


Oddly enough, they were able to put into words better than I have ever been able to do.  I was trying to explain how I think I am doing alright, but it is hard to say.  In the past few years, I have had multiple colleagues and friends take medical leaves from work due to mental health reasons.  When they shared with me their experiences, they would describe things that I often felt while I was doing well, or at least only experiencing mild issues.  I am not saying this to minimize their pain - I truly believe that what they were experiencing was horrific for them.  It just threw me for a loop because I realized that maybe I was way, way sicker than I realized.  


Anyways, my friend said this:  


**""Maybe your mental illness is like Chronic Pain.  You have been living with it for so long, so you have become accustomed to it.  The pain is extreme, but you have learned to live with it day to day.  When someone else experiences that same pain, they feel how extreme it is and they haven't had the time to become accustomed.  You call your doctor if your pain gets worse because you know that you will live through your usual pain.  They don't know that yet, because they haven't had to live through it day to day.  This isn't downplaying their pain or dismissing yours.  It recognizes that both you and they are in pain, but what help you need for that pain is different because of the context.""**",bipolar_disorder

"He is the one with bi-polar. We have been together a year and he is the love of my life. He has has things well under control the whole time and I have been there for him. Itâ€™s been a tough year (he is a widower, his kids are struggling with grief, he lost a job, the lost goes on) but he has weathered it so well and we have become stronger, closer, and more in love. 

He has had some lows and highs, but they have been pretty mild. He says this year with me has been the most stable he has ever felt. We have been really good for each other. 

And then tonight. It was out of nowhere, in public, with his extended family. There were some stressors - albeit mild ones compared with the rest of the year - and it was like a switch flipped. He raged and screamed at his family in the parking lot. I knew what was happening and got him away, got him home. It took a couple of hours to bring him down but I did. Not before he broke his phone and raged enough I was scared and crying a few times. I didnâ€™t really believe he would hurt me - but I wasnâ€™t sure about himself. 

By the end of the night he was in tears. Exhausted. I know he has had so much childhood trauma and has started dealing with it and healing lately. I think it all bubbles up. He is feeling tremendous shame and guilt for the outburst. He feels not enough. He feels angry and lonely and like he wants to disappear. I feel at such a loss as to what to say. I held him and told him I loved him just the same, that I can take it, told him all the ways he makes my world complete, that nothing tonight changes things for me. It felt like I couldnâ€™t make him believe it. 

I know tomorrow he is going to wake up with the worst hangover of shame and remorse and depression. I donâ€™t know what to do or say to help. I know I canâ€™t fix it for him. But what helps you when are this low and feeling awful about how you have acted? His family will understand because they know what this is. (And if they donâ€™t, fuck â€˜em. They cause him the stress anyways.) 

Just desperate to comfort and help him.",bipolar_disorder

"I'm mostly just here to rant, because I find that the people in my life are not very understanding or helpful. I've had a bipolar diagnosis for about 6 years, and haven't had any successes (yet) with medication. Mostly, I was self medicating with alcohol and drugs for a long time (about eleven years) for not only bipolar but anxiety and PTSD from child abuse, which I was diagnosed with this month.

I went to rehab this year and have been trying to stay sober, but I've relapsed a few times. Nothing wrong with that, just brush the dust off and keep going. But the past few days I've been in a mixed episode while sober. I've been depressed, crying all the time, getting in fights with people, self-isolating, irritable, paranoid, the works. I'm not medicated right now--I tried almost every anti-depressant before my bipolar diagnosis, then afterwards have been prescribed antipsychotics which didn't help. I was prescribed Lamictal recently but my gut instinct is to not take it, and so far my gut instinct has never been wrong about meds. I'm not looking to be convinced otherwise, as everyone else in my life I've told this has already shamed me for my decision not to take it. This is just a personal choice, nothing against meds, I just have not had a lot of success and the side effect profile of Lamictal has scared me away from it--I don't think I've ever seen a list of side effects that was that hardcore, lol. I'm very open to taking any other medication than this, so I guess I will see how that goes. 

I know a lot of people through Alcoholics Anonymous, but people there seem to have an ill conceived understanding of dual-diagnosed addiction. I don't get a lot of empathy from people in the program, so I stopped turning to them for support. It sucks because I just feel so lonely, I feel alienated from people. I don't know how else to stop an episode than to drink. I know that other people here may understand where I'm coming from. And I know that there's a way out of this if I just keep pushing forward--trying to find meds I'm comfortable taking, staying with outpatient rehab shit, finding coping skills, things like that. I'm just so exhausted. I'm like, in my mid twenties and I feel like my whole life has just been me fighting everyone and everything, and I'm just so tired of it. I don't want to do this anymore, I'm just frustrated and I want to give up.

I guess what I'm upset about is just how fucking long and painful this process is. I can't stay sober if I'm not treated, and treatment is so hard to attain. It's so much easier to find immediate relief than to keep repeating this cycle of trying meds, getting sick, and getting off them, having to find new therapists, new psychiatrists, having to justify and explain everything. People treat me like I'm crazy for acting the way I do, but I know that the way I act makes sense in respect to my life, even if it's harmful. 

I was almost kicked out of my outpatient program a few weeks ago for drinking. It scares me to think of the prospect of failing out of this. I don't want to be one of those people who just slips through the cracks, can't get anything right, gets kicked out of every program. I just want empathy, and I don't want to feel alone. Instead I feel judged and misunderstood by people I wanted to trust. Maybe it's just that good ol' manic paranoia, but it hurts. I've never had success getting out of an episode sober, so I don't really know what to do. I feel like everything I'm trying to communicate to people is just getting lost somehow--like I know what I need, but other people don't hear that for some reason. 

This is my first post here so I hope this doesn't break any rules /-: just to be sure, know that I am *not* advocating for self-medicating with drugs and alcohol. Unless you want to be like, chugging a half pint of vodka in the bathroom at the grocery store, don't take my example--there's a better way through this, and I hope I can find it soon.

If you bothered to read this, thanks--peace and props to you for getting through that.",bipolar_disorder

Seroquel, lithium, Lamictal, and Haldol have all failed me.

I hate living like this. Being manic this long feels like being a hostage in my own body. I'm losing any sense of who I am.

The process of trying new medications is so slow, but I feel like I'm running out of time. I feel panicked. I don't know how long a human body can tolerate being manic without breaks.

I do not remember much from my first manic episode. I now am 22 and am on ECT. ECT shock therapy got me out of mania. It helped me stabilize and be emotionally neutral. But it laso left me numb. I don't feel joys or sadness. I even have poor memory retention.

      My family is meased up. Very religious but not empathetic. I wont be like them. Even though I am numb I am resilient and will be more caring of others. My father who passed away when I was 18 told my mom and I not to tell his family I am bipolar 1. When I went to visit my aunt during one of my manic episosde she told the family that i was begging her for money. I have not spoken to them since. I cut them off.

       During one episode I do recall kissing my best friend. I guess that's why my bestfriend left me at 16. I have no idea why I kissed my best friend when I am asexual. I guess the kissing is a symptom of mania. Jk I have no clue. But I am happy my best friend is happy even if thats without me.",bipolar_disorder

"Hi, all. 

So, I'm thinking about switching doctors. I saw mine two days before I got admitted into the psych hospital recently. She told me the hospital wouldn't do me any good, but she didn't refer me to a CSU or even bother changing my medicine or anything. Instead, she just discussed the possibility of ECT with me and then sent me on my way. It was my therapist who got the ball rolling for Hospital Land. 

I'm kinda mad at my psychiatrist for not doing enough when I was so bad off. I'm also mad, because I feel like every single psychiatrist I have ever encountered has failed me in some capacity. I've decided I'm going to address my physical health concerns and see where that takes me. Specifically, some family members of mine recently learned that they have a rare genetic disease. I'm going to get tested for it next week, and my results should be back from that two weeks after I'm tested. The rare genetic disease in question is called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or EDS. EDS does cause hypermobility of virtually every joint in your body, and it can cause inflammation everywhere. That inflammation can contribute to mood instability, and I'm starting to think that's where part of my issues are coming from (I also mentioned my theory about a nerve pressing somewhere it isn't supposed to in another post). 

So, I want a new doctor for a few reasons. I want somebody who will take me seriously and do something when I'm in crisis mode. But I also want a doctor who is educated about physical health matters. This isn't even the full extent of my health concerns. For example, when I was four or five years old, I was bouncing on top of a bouncy ball, and I fell on top of a doorknob and busted the back of my head open. I wonder if I have brain damage from it today that is manifesting itself as mood instability. These are things someone with a neurology background might know. 

I just want some answers, and I feel like the entire field of psychiatry has failed me. That's why I'm looking elsewhere. I'm getting a neurologist, rheumatologist, and even a dermatologist (to perform the skin punch to test for EDS) on board. I'm fed up with psychiatrists. Had my way about it, I'd get my psych meds from a neurologist. They'd probably know more about it than these damned psychiatrists do. Ugh.",bipolar_disorder

"I never saw the diagnosis written out until I had to print out my medical history and saw that it said â€œunspecified.â€ I looked up what that meant and now I just feel confused. I am wondering if it is because of being unsure if I had true mania. I was wondering if anyone with mild mania could explain what they experience. 

Before being medicated with Lamictal and Wellbutrin, I was cycling between depressive moods (that last a few weeks) and a shorter time like a week of feeling the extreme opposite, happy and ready to take control of things but I think it was mild mania. During this â€œhappyâ€ time I would consider big life changes like quitting my job and would obsessively look for jobs and get excited that I could have something much better. Getting interviews gave me an ego boost. Sometimes I would get these great ideas about starting side projects or random other things, honestly they made no sense once I was depressed again. I had mild overspending, definitely spent more money when I was happy. The happy periods would confuse my partner and they exhausted me.

"Hi I'm a 24f who lives with an amazing partner 25m. 

I live with a diagnosis of bipolar and my partner is spick and span mentally. He literally is as solid as a rock and only has a few days where he feels down (like a normal human being!).

When I've asked him what it's like to be with someone who has bipolar disorder (aka me) he kinda just shrugs and says, 'it's normal - like any other relationship'.

I personally feel like that isn't true. Sure, for the most part I am stable because of medication, lifestyle changes + therapy, but there are definitely periods where I'm not the easiest person to deal with. 

I'm hoping that there are some people in this sub who would be willing to share their experience of dating/being in a relationship with someone who has bipolar. Do you feel like it's ""normal"" or ""different"" compared to someone who has/hasn't got bipolar? What are the pros/cons? Be candid with me. 

And if you're the person in the relationship who has bipolar disorder, what does it feel like for you having a ""normal"" partner? What are the pros/cons?

 (For me, a con would be it can be hard for my partner to understand the importance of therapy in keeping me stable - he sometimes doesn't see the point of it haha but pro-wise, he's steady/stable and can see when a potential episode may be beginning before I can).

"Bipolar type 2, diagnosed May 2022, on meds since then. First started displaying symptoms of bipolar in my early teens, I am now 28, and female.

Iâ€™ve been dating my current partner since October 2020, we moved in together May 2021. There was about 1,5 years of our relationship where I was really struggling with my mental health, and a lot of damage was done on my part. To mention a few things I was not clear enough about me being separated and not just single when we started dating, I did lie about a few things like not having finished my degree (I said I had) out of shame for my mental health not allowing me to finish. He is also angry at me for having credit card debt (about 1/2 of my annual income), which Iâ€™ve accumulated throughout numerous hypomanic episodes over the years. 

We fight a lot, and we went to couples therapy for the first time on Friday. Basically in his opinion I am a manipulative, lying and untrustworthy person that he has a lot of anger towards. He said he wonâ€™t marry me because he doesnâ€™t trust me with money/finances. Seeing myself in this light has been incredibly hurtful and hard, especially since these things happened quite some time ago, and I have really tried to be better, do better, and build trust and gain forgiveness.

So I guess what I am asking is, does anyone have advice regarding â€œcleaning upâ€ after the damage youâ€™ve done while suffering from this illness? What steps did you take to straighten things out?

TLDR; before getting diagnosed I repeatedly broke my partners trust, he has not forgiven me and is very angry/resentful towards me, we are in therapy. What more can I do to straighten things out now that Iâ€™m diagnosed and medicated?",bipolar_disorder

"Hello!

I've been used to a corporate environment where mental health issues are punished rather than supported. Ive learned that I need to hide my disorder because management would see it as a threat to profits, especially when I was in sales. 

I learned about a 4th trauma response, there's flight, fight, freeze, and now I know of fawn. Fawn suddenly made so much sense. Like a little rolling on it's back when a big dog comes near as if to say ""don't eat me I'm cute and lovable"", that's how I'd survive layoffs- be liked, and never show weakness. Needless to say it is exhausting and I'd get burnt out over and over. 

I just started teaching music at a Catholic school. It is a maternity leave gig, so there would be risk that disclosing this would potentially jeopardize being hired should the previous teacher not return (a few of my coworkers seemed to hint that she might not due to her commute time and her general sentiment before I showed up). That said, at a faculty meeting, I had culture shock of how vulnerability was accepted and okay among the teachers. This school is in Chicago, so it is actually quite progressive. We have trans teachers and teach kids love is love and your identity is yours to be respected. I've loved everything I've seen and the values we are teaching- this is a far cry from what I knew of Catholic schools growing up. 

While I know this is generally on a need to know basis, I do feel I'd like at least one person to know what I'm going through and what experience I have. I had to chat with a kid who got in a fight with another kid, and I empathized with the anger and frustration he had in him. I told him his strong emotions are a gift, but just like Spiderman's powers, he is on a journey to control them so he can swing from building to building, and not accidentally blowing up toilets. I know he just wanted to be heard, and know he's not bad. 

In another class I had a little girl who felt sad and she didn't know why. I sat with her and we made sadness an imaginary friend. I said it's okay to feel sad, and sadness can sit here, but let's try some mindfulness techniques. I'll be here with you, we can sing/ listen to ""don't worry, be happy"" and let sadness stand up and leave when she's ready. 

I've been so impressed with the support I've had so far that it's easy to think this time might be different. But I'm not sure- I'd really love to hear from teachers, especially those who may be at a school that seems to have this kind of atmosphere.",bipolar_disorder

"There's a #manic post in my Facebook memories from three years ago, and my goodness... It's a little (or a lot) embarrassing. 

On this day three years ago I was released from my city's (City A) General Hospital after a 72 hour hold, still incredibly sick with mania and psychosis. In hindsight, as much as I hated it... I wish they had kept me longer. 

What I did next was not rational. I hopped on a train to my home city 3 hours away (City B) which my dad begged me not to do. He knew how sick I was. He'd been through it a hundred times with my mom. 

I have never spoken about this publicly because there is a lot of shame attached to having this illness and being that sick. It's a tricky disease, because mania is a pathalogical liar and I had zero awareness that I was even sick! 

That train ride from City A to City B was... Embarrassing, overwhelming, and I truly believed there was going to be an emergency on the train like a crash, or a bomb... I was packed for it, a huge bag with supplies one might need during a disaster with lots of injuries (food, bandages, towels, first aid kit, toilet paper, etc). I even had a clip board to take a roster of people after the disaster. 

I got off the train in random City D, because I was Sherlock Holmes and figured out that the disaster was going to be on a train to a completely different city, and I had to be on that train. Standing on the train platform I saw some police officers in the distance and my sick brain told me I had to call 911. So I did. And they came. Many police officers came and the rest is very hazy... I do remember believing Google was recording absolutely everything, and I remember the police trying to calm me down. It was a process but I eventually got there. They knew my dad was going to pick me up at the station in City B so they let me board the next train. 

My dad picked me up at the station, and took me straight to the hospital emergency room. I think deep down by that point I had a very small notion that the hospital is where I needed to be. 

I spent three days in the emergency mental health hold room. No windows, wasn't allowed outside at all. I slightly remember a freak out one night that required me to be injected with sedation. 

They were trying to get me a bed in the hospital there, but because of the wait times and the fact that my address was in City A, they transferred me to the hospital there. That 3 hour drive was the only fresh air I'd get for the next five days. I wasn't allowed to leave my hospital ward, and they didn't have anyone to take you for fresh air. You had to wait until they deemed you safe to go outside and return on your own. 

I ended up staying another 28 days, and was still sick when they released me, still manic, but much more calm and now medicated. The coming down time from that psychosis was slow. I remained high for a few weeks before the big crash. The crash was the worst if ever felt in my life... The shame, the loss of my best friend, meds with serious side effects and cognitive decline. Worst winter of my life. 

By July 2020 I was still on disability, unable to work and unable to survive living alone, so I moved from. City A to my home City B in with my mother and elderly aunt. 

I ended up cycling into another manic/psychotic episode in August 2020 when I was visiting my now husband (in a whole new City), and ended up in hospital again for 8 days. I had arrived for a visit with him already manic, and over two weeks it turned into psychosis. The difference this time is I was with someone who took very good care of me through the big ""up"" and then the terrible crash down. 

I have been stabilized now for about two years, mostly suffering from bouts of depression, as I always have... Except now, they're not lasting as long, or running as deep. 

Healing has been happening for a very long time. That first hospital stay was my worst nightmare and biggest fear... That I'd end up like my mom, who at 64 is incredibly mentally unwell and not expected to improve. Scared of being in and out of hospital for months at a time and basically living my entire adult life mentally ill. 

#BipolarDisorder is a lifelong illness. Genetics, childhood trauma, interruptions in development, being parentified, alienated, etc etc have all culminated in a brain that works very differently from others. It means an enlarged amygdala constantly putting me in a fight, flight, or freeze survival mode. It's having to learn to navigate life on your own. 

All this to say: I believe the worst is behind me. I believe I have learned about my disorder and have so much lived experience with it, that I will not follow in my mom's footsteps. I believe that I may very well never experience another mania and psychosis because I am on medication to prevent it. I believe that if I do have an episode that I am surrounded by incredible people that will do their best to support me in my time of need in whatever way they are capable. 

I got married Saturday, it was a fairy tale wedding and we were surrounded by love and family and friends. Our honeymoon has wrapped up and my husband and I are on the drive home today. I definitely rode the high of that wonderful wedding experience and feel myself coming down now and will focus on self care to hopefully prevent a crash. 

There is always hope. I found my hope a long time ago because sometimes it was literally all I had. Hope and baby steps. In the depths of despair, hope and baby steps are about the only thing that kept me hanging on. 

Well, my hope flourished into a life I never really imagined possible, and I march towards mental wellness with every baby step I take.",bipolar_disorder

"This sounds so stupid. I was diagnosed with BP at Fourteen and my medication worked for a little ... until it didn't. Long story short, my medication was not working at all. 

During this duration (November 20' - April 21') my BP was out of control. Extremely depressed one day and the next I would be going to the store thinking I can make a buisness out of diy stuff. Hint hint, I would get out of my episode after a day and think about how much money I just wasted. 

Now, I am on much better medication yet sometimes I do get that itch to do a whole arts and crafts buisness thing. So, instead of saying a flat out no, I go to the store (typically dollar store or a crafts store) and get one item to do just as a test run knowing that feeling will fizzle out. I tell myself if I can do this one item (buying the bare necessities for cheap) then I can look into doing a second one. It's a trick on my brain to not buy it all at once, to just try a single item (one being a flower pot painted and decorated), and if I like that one, do a second one. I know this feeling will go away and my wallet won't have taken a hit more than 10-15 dollars. 

Again not sure if this makes a lot of sense, but ik if someone else goes through the same thing, this is a method to not go overboard with the spending.",bipolar_disorder
I'm having signs that I'm going into an episode and unsure if it's time to start marking that I have a disability to take reigns on them by taking days off from my work schedule vs. going with my regular day to day masking it and internally putting myself through more hell when I'm experiencing one.,bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™m applying for jobs and every single one lists bipolar as a disability and asks if Iâ€™d like to say â€œyes I have a disability.â€ Or â€œno I donâ€™t have a disabilityâ€ or â€œI donâ€™t wish to answer.â€ How do you all answer and why?

"TLDR: Reaching out for insights and support about coping with being in a family that knows exactly what to do when youâ€™re having an episode, yet they are unsupportive and/or hostile when you have symptoms. How do you cope with that deep level of rejection from the people that youâ€™re told to lean on? 

Even  though I know itâ€™s irrational, it makes me feel unlovable and profoundly  f***** up. I know itâ€™s not my fault, but my immediate family treats me as if it is. They talk about it like I had the ability to make choicesâ€”even when I know, and they know Iâ€™m theory, that I didnâ€™t. Theyâ€™ve shown necessary compassion to my older sister who has a near identical illness to mine, but the opposite for me. People talk about de-stigmatizing mental illness + increasing support for it, yet Iâ€™ve seen very little of it in my daily life.


Want to note:
1) I have a â€œchosen familyâ€ who I know loves me
2) Iâ€™ve been in therapy since 2014
3) I have brought this up to them my family and they aggressively deny it.
4) PLEASE for the love of Buddha donâ€™t tell me what to do. You donâ€™t know my whole story. Pls just share if youâ€™ve experienced this and how *you* cope. 
6) i thoroughly work CBT and DBT,
and affirmations just donâ€™t work for me 
7) Iâ€™m an atheist so please spare me God talk.

My experience: 
I wish I could say that my family couldnâ€™t recognize my mania or accompanying psychosis, and therefore distanced themselves from me. I wish I could say that they didnâ€™t know what to do. However, my parents have been in NAMI for 15+ years. My Dad literally runs one of their support groups. This is because my older sister has severe schizophrenia, which entered our lives in about 2000. The whole family loved and supported her unconditionally, despite the fact that she was violently psychotic and hostile. They got her care and gave her patience, have been by her side through several attempts and hospitalizations. They went to NAMI and explained that it was a physical illness, like cancer, and to have compassion and still reach out to her.

Cut to 2012, when I first started to experience mania, depression, and psychosis. My delusions were common ones, and my parents/family barely acknowledged that I was delusional. I was literally telling them that I was  â€œinterpreting messagesâ€ from crows, and their response was anger and talking to me less and less. Not once did anyone suggest that I see a psychiatrist or therapist. It took 3 years and suicidal ideation to have *one* of my aunts care and suggest that I go to therapy.  

One of the things that hurts me most is that they knew it gets harder to treat the longer itâ€™s around without meds. They knew it gets more and more emotionally torturous when left untreated. They knew this, yet everyone held me accountable for my maniaâ€”even when I expressed that I was having â€œpanic attacksâ€ daily and getting of 2-4 hours of sleep each night.

Maybe the most poignant example is that once, when my dad was driving me to high school, he told me that his worst fear was my sister becoming homeless because of her illness. Yet, I experienced homelessness for a month in 2013 because of mania, and when I told him the next month he just looked shocked, didnâ€™t comment on it, and never brought it up again. I later asked to live with him when I had nowhere else to go, and he rejected the idea the first couple of times I ask. Mind you, my sister treated them â€œworseâ€ than I ever did, and they were always warm and welcoming to her. 

I try to reassure myself with the facts, but it still hits a deep, primal wound.

"I have ADHD but was also recently â€œdiagnosedâ€ with possible Bipolar.

I think they wanted to be safe with having Bipolar on their mind because of the mood swings and depression. But frequent mood swings are common with ADHD and also tend to have increased stress, anxiety, and association with depression. All of this is so confusing lol.

"
So Iâ€™m not really sure where to start.. Iâ€™ve had issues with depression on and off for majority of my life. This past year however, Iâ€™ve been stuck in a particularly bad episode of depression that just seemed to get worse and worse to the point where I was SH and planning on ending it all. 
As a last ditch attempt to get help, I went to the doctors (something I very rarely do, especially for mental health issues due to past trauma seeking help) 
Before the appointment I made a list of problems that I wanted to address with my fiancÃ© because I have a terrible memory and figured it would make it easier for me to just read off a list. Long story short, the GP suggests that Iâ€™m suffering from a mood disorder and itâ€™s most likely bipolar. 
I had never even considered this as a possibility but the more I look into it, the more itâ€™s starting to make sense to me. So the GP books me in for an assessment. But the NHS in the UK is rammed with people trying to get mental health assessments and so actually getting assessed is a very long process. All the while my depression is getting even more dark and Iâ€™m desperate for some kind of medication to â€œfix meâ€. The GP had explained to me during my appointment that she didnâ€™t feel comfortable prescribing me any antidepressants because she was concerned the effect they would have on me if I was bipolar. 
But she told me to contact her if I hadnâ€™t had my assessment in two weeks. I didnâ€™t hear anything, so I contacted her and I was put in touch with the mental health nurse instead. She doesnâ€™t really know what the appointment is about and prescribes me some anxiety medication (which I didnâ€™t end up taking because I was far too anxious to) she also says that the assessment would be in a couple of weeks. So I hang on for two more weeks hoping that the assessment will happen soon so I can just get some medication. Again I hear nothing and the SH and thoughts of AS are getting out of control, so I contact the doctors again. They give me another appointment with the mental health nurse and she prescribes me 50mg sertraline and some sleeping pills. I explain to her what the Gp had said about the possible bipolar and that I was worried something would go wrong if I took the sertraline, but she assured me it would be fine and that she didnâ€™t think it would be an issue. She also said to take them before bed, just incase I feel dizzy or sick. So just before bed, and after about 30mins of pure anxiety I decide to take the pill. 
After about a hour I started to feel amazing. I felt like the entire world was at peace and I didnâ€™t feel any sadness in the slightest. I donâ€™t really remember much of what I said/did but I remember my fiancÃ© looking at me weird and i was convinced he and my mum were secretly talking about me. He even stayed home from work because he was concerned about me. I didnâ€™t feel tired at all but I did end up sleeping because I thought that everyone would be mad at me if I didnâ€™t. When I woke up I still felt great and had so much energy I could actually do stuff again. I even went out walking a bunch because I just felt like I was climbing the walls in the house. I still feel really good at the moment and have so much energy I donâ€™t know what to do with it. Iâ€™ve been trying to go out walking to try and feel tired but I just donâ€™t. Iâ€™ve also been yawning so much that it actually makes me feel sick every time I do, itâ€™s not even like tired yawning, itâ€™s almost like a tick? Iâ€™m also shaking a lot. I just feel like Iâ€™m going to explode with energy. My fiancÃ© spoke to the mental health nurse who said to stop taking the pill immediately and that she would try and get the assessment brought forward. But yeah, Iâ€™m just not sure what to do now. I donâ€™t feel depressed anymore but I am having a hard time focusing on things. Iâ€™ve done a lot of cleaning and managed to do a lot of work. But yeah I guess I just wanted some advice or any suggestions? Iâ€™m not sure what to do with all of this energy I now have! Or what to do whilst waiting for my assessment :/ Oh also one of my eyes dilated but the other didnâ€™t.. so I guess that was cool ðŸ˜‚",bipolar_disorder

"I used to be SO a embarrassed of my manic episodes. Iâ€™ve found the only way I can deal with remembering them is to have a good laugh at how wild they were. 

I *do* feel bad that I genuinely joined a church full of kind and genuine people and seemed super into it just to leave a few months later. I feel like I used them. But other than that I can laugh at it.

Cutting all my hair off into some UGLY home styles, buying dumb shit (Though Iâ€™m not able to laugh at the debtâ€¦but I am proud of myself for putting safe guards in place to prevent more debt), joining a cult for like 6 weeks, attempting to legally change my name, and so on

Iâ€™m very optimistic (perhaps too optimisticâ€¦) that on these new meds I wonâ€™t go past a mild hypomania. So being less afraid of it happening again might be why I can.

"So this is kind of a weird question. I am constantly getting myself injured before big events, or before I have to go do something I donâ€™t really want to do.

On Monday I was teaching my brother some self defense moves as heâ€™s been getting bullied pretty badly. I showed him how to get out of a headlock, and in doing so nearly ripped off my right pinky toe, it has a major fracture. The next morning my moms poodle went blade runner on my cat who has to be outside for the time being. I lunged for the dog to stop her, fell pretty bad, and now have a buckle fracture on my left radial head.

I went to the er for them, and got everything treated. Now hereâ€™s why Iâ€™m wondering if Iâ€™m subconsciously doing this. Today is my first birthday since my husband passed away. I have been dreading it. My husband always went all out for my birthdays, and I am still grieving losing him every second. Since October when he took his life Iâ€™ve broken a rip, cut up my hand really badly, gotten a few concussions, scraped my legs up really badly tubing, and just generally have some kind of injury.

Maybe this is all in my head. Even before he passed I would get the weirdest clumsiest injuries. The day before a previous birthday I sneezed so hard I slipped a disc in my back. Does anyone else feel like they subconsciously self sabotage like this? I used to self harm before I was diagnosed, and havenâ€™t purposefully hurt myself in about 5 years.

Flash forward to today, and the psychiatrist I saw today was the first doctor I have interacted with in this whole past year who took time to explain what was happening to me. He explained the different symptoms, how mania and hypomania works and so on. He told me based on what I related to him I mostly likely had bipolar type 1.

"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 6 years ago and placed on Lamotrigine which has made a tremendous improvement on my quality of life. Iâ€™ve tried several antidepressants and they all had side effects worse than what they were meant to treat, so none stuck.

I recently started seeing a psychologist and brought up that I suspected I also had ADHD or ASD. Within the first visit, she says that she suspects I donâ€™t actually have BD, and that ADHD explains everything Iâ€™m describing. We have since used assessments to confirm yes, I do have ADHD. However, I donâ€™t feel like it actually explains everything.

Something that really rubbed me the wrong way was when I was describing my spending habits. I have periods that my PCP and I have described as hypomania which often lead to impulsive spending. For the most part, especially nowadays, Iâ€™m able to exhibit some self-control. I donâ€™t overspend because I know it would negatively impact my partner and our relationship. But I do have that compulsion to spend and I have to actively resist it. And there are times where Iâ€™ll use an area of interest or something Iâ€™m hyperfocused on as an excuse to spend beyond what I â€œshouldâ€. Her response was â€œthat sounds like more self-control than someone would have with hypomaniaâ€. Which sounded incredibly insulting, like maybe Iâ€™m just good at coping and Iâ€™ve been on a mood stabilizer for 6 years which helps me manage.

I also donâ€™t really have periods of not needing sleep, or needing significantly less sleep. But Iâ€™m also just kind of a sleepy person. What I do have are periods of time of irritability and jitteriness, where I feel like thereâ€™s a motor driving me forward. Iâ€™ve seen the phrase â€œwired but tiredâ€ and that very much feels like how I feel in those times. And I will have these periods of time where I stay up several hours later than normal, getting 6-7 hours of sleep. While I wake up tired, I wake up just about as tired as the nights I sleep 9-10 hours. Sometimes thereâ€™s a specific focus, other times I just donâ€™t feel like sleeping.

So Iâ€™m kind of stuck. It seems like I fall in a gray zone of not being â€œenoughâ€ to be diagnosed but not really seeming like thereâ€™s a clear alternative that explains everything. Is this just not a good doctor? Or am I clinging onto a diagnosis because itâ€™s what Iâ€™ve thought for years?",bipolar_disorder

Over the past two years, I have fully poured my heart out to this woman and she has essentially found out that I am bipolar and suffer from some very severe and aggressive hypomanias that have previously led to some bad habits.

"I'm currently in the midst of one, and I'm just trying to find some kind of new distraction. I have a very hard time focusing on things like watching a move or TV and *especially* reading, which I love to do otherwise, when I'm in a depressive episode. However, I've always been able to stay at least somewhat focused when playing video games. I guess it's because I'm more actively engaged? I don't really know, nor do I care. It works.

So do y'all have any similar experience with video games making things a little easier? If so, what do you like to play. I find that playing things like RTS and grand strategy games helps me focus a lot. Even something like FIFA keeps me attentive, though that's not always the best game if you're looking to feel better. 

I'm looking forward to seeing if anyone else does this and if they feel that it helps. I also just might have to steal some of your go-to games if I'm intrigued lol

No matter how much I go out or sign up for a new hobby it almost seem impossible to make new connections as an adult. Itâ€™s totally not easy as signing up to the gym and meeting new ppl like some say. I only have my family whom i love very much but what will happen when Iâ€™ll have to work overseas?

Over the past few months Iâ€™ve started having awful intrusive thoughts. Some disturbing, some just downright ridiculous. Thoughts I cannot shake. They are constantly there no matter how hard I try not to think about them. Iâ€™ve also been having instances where I think Iâ€™ve done something that I have not done. Almost anytime I hit a pothole on the road Iâ€™m convinced I hit a person. I convinced myself today at work I yelled a slur very loud and everyone heard me even though I 100% did not. Why does this happen? Iâ€™ve experienced anxiety all my life and was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2 but Iâ€™m starting to think this is more than anxiety. I am constantly paranoid about anything and everything.

I havenâ€™t been formally diagnosed with OCD but the more I read about it the more fitting it sounds for me. Iâ€™m on quite a few medications but I havenâ€™t found one that helps with these thoughts yet. Do they ever stop?

"Hello everyone, Iâ€™m seeking more advice as this is all new to me.

My significant other had a manic episode at the beginning of September after abruptly discontinuing their SSRI around mid-August. After reading a lot and learning some terms. I think they were hypomanic from about September 2 thru 6, didnâ€™t get treatment, and this turned into a full blown manic episode wirh delusions by about Sep 10, which led to a voluntary hospital visit and a 10 day stay. She seems to be dealing with a mix of delusions of reference, delusions of persecution, and to a lesser extent delusions of grandeur.

She was released yesterday. She is so much calmer. It was amazing to have a 90 minute phone conversation with her. She is still delusional and paranoid though. To make a long story short, she still thinks thereâ€™s some vague conspiracy afoot and still thinks many of the other patients/staff were â€œin on it.â€

A specific paranoid fear she has is that Iâ€™m unsafe because she kept losing the paper she wrote my phone number on in the hospital. She thinks people stole it from her that could be dangerous to me. This one is difficult because she might be entirely rightâ€”other patients may have stolen my phone number, but Iâ€™m perfectly safe.

Having experienced similar delusions twice (once for close to a week, second time I â€œsnappedâ€ out of it in a night), I know this wonâ€™t be solved overnight. But how best do I talk to and support her, without reinforcing the delusions? They inevitably come up if we talk for a while, even if only in passing.

My memory improved and I had motivation again. Trouble is I canâ€™t keep this up. My brain feels like heaven but my body ... well 800mg makes my body feel really weak and fat and terrible. Taking 800mg for a week made my stomach bloated and I gained 0.7 kg. Not to mention possible side effects pertaining to high cholesterol, heart diseases, etc.  Iâ€™m  wondering why is this? When I felt lazy and tired and terrible I always blamed the medicine but when I took such a high dose it actually made me feel normal and good? Like Iâ€™d sleep 4 hours and wake up feeling refreshed on 800. On 400 Iâ€™d sleep for ten hours and not wake up and even when I do I feel terrible. Could it be that a lot of the side effects of antipsychotics are actually our illness because of too low a dosage?

"I already posted today, but I just need to rant about something. 

So, I posted on Saturday about how my mom drove my car to the next town over, and it broke down on her. Turns out, the mechanic won't be able to fix it for two weeks. 

My mom borrowed my step dad's mother's car. She said I wasn't allowed to drive the car, which I totally understand. However, I had planned on going to the temp agency after my psychiatrist appointment tomorrow to see if I can get on at that factory. My mom was going to drive me, that's not the issue. 

The issue is, my mom might need to go out of town next week. So, we'd have a few problems. For one thing, even if I were allowed to drive that car, my mom would be forced to get a rental car, which would be expensive. Also, my mom would need me to stay home and babysit our dogs. 

I just had it set in my mind that this job would solve a lot of the problems I'm having right now. I'm in a state of serious financial hardship at the moment. Making my car payments is a real struggle, and I can't even afford a burrito from taco bell like I've been wanting for over a week now. I feel like having a little peace with the car payment and some loose change to get a burrito every once in a while would make me feel somewhat happier. 

I've also been struggling to find the motivation to shower like I should. I feel like if I had a job, I'd be leaving the house more. And if I were leaving the house more, I'd feel more motivated to be clean. 

I just want to be like other people my age, too. I want to feel like I'm contributing to society in some way. There is nothing satisfying about sitting at home like a potato all day, every day.

Iâ€™m not talking about ignoring my bipolar diagnosis, but really attempting to make a new start where there are less memories and less people that perceive you ass the one who â€œlost her shitâ€ (went manic) in 2019. 

I know that wherever you are, you are, but I just feel like Iâ€™m walking amongst ghost and bad memories â€” even though I love my state.   Iâ€™ve tried in vain to make a social life for myself, but to no avail.  Maybe because being sick for so long â€” @ 3 years to fully recover and find proper medication â€” I feel a sense of otherness.  Additionally, I know this might come off as paranoia, but I truly believe my name is too tarnished to really even re-incorporate into society.  And okay â€” maybe thatâ€™s my thinking, but I know others relate.  My mania was epic and I just want a fresh start. 

Hereâ€™s what I know:
- Must have good psychiatrist
- Must have therapist
- Must have hands on support in place (my Buddhist community)
- I have no shame being open about my diagnosis â€” as needed. 

Also, moving out of state will allow me to afford to live independently.  Iâ€™ve been living with my dad since 2019 and heâ€™s super kind and generous, but Iâ€™m 43 and it kind of really adds to my depression.   I feel like a child â€”though Iâ€™m so gratitude filled to have had a safe place to land. 

Lastly, Iâ€™d be near my kids.  There dads had physical custody since my mania in 2019, and is doing everything in his power to alienate me and â€œpunishâ€ me for getting sick.   I wouldnâ€™t have a ton material wise to give them, but I miss being involved in their lives and I feel that Iâ€™ve had enough time to regain stability. I was always an active and involved mom and wasnâ€™t diagnosed until after I had them.  Their dad literally hates me and talks down about me so bad that I donâ€™t even expect much, aside from being there for them â€” Iâ€™m saying that as if I havenâ€™t had my kids every summer and winter break.   We have wonderful visits I devote my full attention to them, cook their favorite foods, take day trips. 

Iâ€™m just so freaking depressed and lonely without them, though I recognize this time was crucial for me to heal.  This year makes 7 years post diagnosis and I feel I have my bipolar â€œsea legsâ€.

I just feel the need to start somewhere new, but of course , long-term stability trumps all.

"I swear I'll get to the point but I think the history here provides a lot of needed context. 

tldr: I broke my partner's trust during an episode and am trying to make amends while being completely depressed.

I  have narcolepsy 2 in addition to bipolar 1. So, because I'm always a sleepy bitch, my mania is usually pretty contained and symptoms were masked. That changed when I was prescribed a stimulant to treat narcolepsy in 2017. It was a rough couple of years where I thought I was losing my mind while struggling with alcohol in a very shit marriage and culminated in 2020 when I tried to end my own life during an especially bad episode. 

I stopped taking the stimulants and loaded up on mood stabilizers after a grippy sock holiday. It was life-changing for me. I left my abusive marriage and was able to start living. I've been incredibly happy with my new situation.

I've been on a stable cocktail for 2 years now but the excessive sleepiness was impacting my ability to work enough hours to afford the mortgage. After talking with my psychiatrist, and begging my new doctor, I was given another stimulant script. I was nervous but thought if things went well, it would improve my life so drastically the risk was worth it.

Things did not go well. 

Reflecting on the 3 weeks I was on the stim, I now see all the signs that were there. They were ramping up very quickly by the end of that 3rd week. I wasn't sleeping or eating right in addition to some really risky behaviors and poor judgment. I have a partner who lives with me, and I talked to them extensively about warning signs ahead of this but he was (admittedly)naive. He'd never been with someone who has BD and I was stable for the 1.5 years we have been together. so he had no idea what hypo-mania looked like.

So, here finally comes the part where I'm a total AH. I ended up sleeping with a friend, didn't use protection and then tried to hide it from my partner. The sex wasn't the issue, as we're open, but not using a condom broke a relationship agreement. It was the lying.

He ended up finding out not even a day later and lost it on me. He broke up with me and ended our D/s relationship but stayed in the home after the fact I was manic came to light. I'm lucky he stuck around tbh. He admits he was not fully prepared for what an episode might look like and missed the signs. He knows I absolutely adore him and love him so much. He doesn't understand how I could lie to him, especially since sleeping with others isn't a problem in our relationship. He feels like he can't believe what I say and a very solid foundation of trust crumbled. 

He's hurting and I'm now fully depressed. I'm doing everything I can to show our relationship is worth salvaging, we are dating again but put our dynamic on hold. It's just been really rough when I can barely get out of bed. 

I just needed somewhere to put this. Even if it doesn't get read or comments chew me up more than support me I had to get it off my chest.",bipolar_disorder
"My papaw died on Sunday night. I haven't been able to sleep since then. I'm still taking my meds, and honestly my mood is mostly stable although I am sad. I'm kind of starting to panic because disruptions to my sleep schedule usually result in a manic episode. I am not sure what to do. Any advice?",bipolar_disorder
"I was extremely self-sabotaging the last week and a half, up through Sunday. It was definitely partially due to a hypomanic episode after a couple major life moments, but then I had drunken nights (along at bars - I know) that I regret, and am thankful wasnâ€™t hurt during. Woke up Monday absolutely ashamed. I am happy to say yesterday and today I did not drink, and focused on being healthy and doing small things to better my day. While I donâ€™t want to go completely sober, I think one of the best changes I can make is to not drink alone, either at home or alone in bars (that was dumb). Iâ€™ve got a fridge filled with healthy foods, as well as La Croixâ€™ sand NA hoppy sparkling water to get me maintain that goal. One step at a time.",bipolar_disorder
Does anyone else experience this and how do you cope? My thoughts usually go like this. My friends donâ€™t actually like me. The guy Iâ€™m talking to/ dating is using me.

"Hi everyone, new to this community and already finding this forum so interesting. I've had an OCD diagnosis for 10 years and only this week found out that Bipolar Spectrum Disorder has been running in the background the entire time too - it felt like a puzzle piece falling in to place when I found out. I live in the UK and going through the NHS its taken a long time to get here and have been living a LOT of my life without the right diagnosis or an understanding of why I've been the way I am. Its made many things about myself and the moods and thoughts I've never been able to explain fall into completely into context. It's hard atm to put into words what all my symptoms are and what my episodes have been like because I wasnt truly aware of being in mania every time its happened. I know the the highs are great but had this uncomfortable energy to them that felt wrong, but the lows were unpredictable and I didnt feel in control at all of how empty I felt and how intense it was. There's a lot of brain fog surrounding it all. Atm my 'highs and lows' still seem to happen sporadically, but reading things on here is helping me to understand things more and start to notice what belongs to my bipolar, how it works, and how to recognise slipping into ups or downs or whatever. Its all so new so lots to learn.

Reading about everyone elses experiences and recognising them in myself is such a weird validating and eye opening feeling so just wanted to say thanks for sharing. I'm 23 so glad it got caught this early but if anyones got any advice for me in these early days of how to manage it (which I know no one doss perfectly, my OCD still does what it wants a lot of the time) and what your experience has been I'd love that.",bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™ve been through some really big up and downs in the last couple of years I just turned 24 but I suspect I have been suffering from this for a lot longer, I sometimes am super impulsive to the point of ruining my life I donâ€™t know what to to getting meds and diagnosis is so expensive in Australia I donâ€™t know what to do",bipolar_disorder
"I knew I had a mood disorder so it isn't a surprise. I have episodes were I have extreme anger. The smallest amount of rejection will set me off. It's like I don't see what I'm doing. My brain goes somewhere else, its like I'm not there. When im overwhelmed I tend to hit myself on my head, thighs, or ribs. 

One time I was doing that and my boyfriend was trying to stop me because I was giving myself a bruise and one second later I started laughing. Like uncontrollable laughing. As if someone told me the funniest joke in the world. It deeply disturbed my boyfriend and he didn't know what to do

When I have my lows it's extremely low. I think I deserve the worst things to happen to me. I think I deserve to be beaten, raped, murdered, anything you can think of. My self esteem is shit. I cut myself when Im in emotional destress. When I make my boyfriend upset during my anger episodes I see that he's upset and I know I should care but I don't. It's like I'm completely numb. When I come down I feel extremely guilty

I trust no one. I have severe abandonment issues. There's time where I'm 100% sure my boyfriend is cheating but there's literally no evidence. Like deep in my soul I am 100% positive that he would never do that. I know how much he loves me yet I refuse to completely trust him. I'm scared to. Any sign of abandonment I remove myself from the situation I guess I do that because I want to leave before they get a chance to leave me first. 

I feel hopeless. I feel like my life will never get better. It's one thing after another and I just want to end it because no one will miss me. I'm just a burden to everyone. I'm just so tired. I don't find pleasure in my hobbies anymore. I used to love writing music, baking, singing. I haven't sung or write music in a year. I still bake but I don't really find joy in it. I sometime just throw it away because it's not good enough. 

I binge when I'm overwhelmed then feel disgusted with myself so I starve myself. I can never relax like ever. I always have to be doing something because if I'm not I will kill myself if I'm left sitting there with my thoughts. I do whatever I can to stay busy. I spend money I dont have.

My depression gets I bad I won't shower, brush my teeth, wash my face, etc for weeks. I find it hard to take care of myself. I've consider checking myself into a facility

I get super paranoid. I can't listen to things like ""there's an asteroid coming towards earth"" I'll completely lose it. I get paranoid everyone hates me and it's just pretending to like me. When I meet people I automatically think they don't like me and is just acting. I don't trust people at all. I wait for people to mess up so I can be like ""I knew it, I knew I could trust you""

I'll go through period of hypersexuality. I'll come on to my boyfriend and say things like ""let's have sex without a condom"" even though in my right mind I would never say that because we don't want kids ever and are very careful. He doesn't even touch me when I'm like that because I'm not In the right headspace. 

So yeah. We're not completely sure of which one. Leaning a little more towards bipolar 1. Just wanted people's input on this.",bipolar_disorder
"Sorry for the long post. 

I, (23F) work(ed) two jobs to keep myself afloat.  I've only just found a new apartment that takes me and my bunny and rent is absolutely insane. I used to work at this family-owned pizza shop for 4 years from the age of 17-21. Since I'm living near it again and they're still up and running, I decided to put in my application. They offered me the role of manager since my old one was leaving and nothing had changed from when I left.

I have been working there for 3 months, and as I remember it, the boss's wife is an absolute cow. If I stand still for two seconds, waiting for something, I will get yelled at and told to do the dishes.

If me or one of the employees make a mistake, I'm yelled at and blamed.

Today was my absolute last straw. A customer gave me the wrong address over the phone and hung up when I asked him to spell it. He was an older man and didnt hear very well. He then didn't pick up the phone afterwards. I tried calling him for a while and ended up consulting someone whose higher than me.

He found an address that sounded very similar and we hoped for the best. It turned out to be the wrong one, the delivery driver (Boss's Wife) took around 40 minutes to find the correct one and another delivery decided to come down and refund the order. 

Their order was for about $80, the wife exclaimed it was going to be taken out of my pay. Then decided to yell at me and call me disguting for touching my hair (very bad nervous habit of mine). For clarity, I don't touch anyone's food, I do everything else and would wash my hands after touching my hair and before touching the food.

After my shift finally finished, I received a text from my boss telling me to stop making so many mistakes. I was very confused because I've only heard of one (Not including this one) over the past 3-4 months. They told me they were losing customers and money and it was either I stop making mistakes or I quit.

Because of today and so much shit I've taken from the boss wife, and for everytime I cried out of frustration when driving home, I opted to quit. Leaving them fucked without a manager, and leaving me fucked, jobless and unable to pay my rent. 

Was this self sabotage? My friend says it is and is concerned for my well-being but I think this is entirely reasonable. Am I just manic right now?",bipolar_disorder
"I don't remember anybody ever telling me if I have 1 or 2. Reading the descriptions it sounds like I have 2. I rapid cycle, have mixed episodes, and have not gone full manic in over a year. But I also read if you have ever haf major episodes of mania which I had about every 6 months from diagnosis in 2018 until early 2021. I only had major manic episodes during times of extreme stress.

"Lately I'm super curious about what is that we do that's different from normal people, i don't mean just episodes and ups and downs, that's the obvious part, i mean the subtle part about the thinking process of mentally ill people thats never been really studied

For example i moved in this new city of 100k people, i want to date girls and find friends, i find people who are tagged on ig on local clubs, then look on their friend list to see if they follow each other. 

For example i find a guy who is the local dj and search for him on girls pages to see if they follow him, the idea is to find out how much groups here are already interconnected, because if everybody know each other since they were kids it will be harder for me to insert myself

And also i wonder how many groups are in a city of 100k that don't know each other, if there are many it is better for me because if i fail to insert myself in one group there's always onother

Anyways, these past few months I have been very impulsive and it feels like I have not in control of my thoughts and actions. Especially after this one instance with this one dude I was talking toâ€¦. Long story short he asked for me for some money and I told him I did not have it, but the following day I ended up sending him the money and I have no idea though! Idk what I was thinking because it was a large amount of money and I canâ€™t even explain it to him because Iâ€™m not sure if heâ€™s open to even talking to me because he blocked me and did not pay me back when he said he would (sorry that was kinda a lot to add) I would have never done that if I was myself so I have just been thinking am I in a manic episode or something else because I have also spent all my savings and money over around $5k in less than 2 months. 

And I have just been doing a lot of random things impulsively and not thinking rationally and now the consequences are catching up to me to also add I have also been very unreliable which is not me at allâ€¦.And I have been kind of more emotional and seeking affection from guys in like being hypersexual or doing risky behaviors or like I just cannot focus because I have so many ideas in my head and so many things I have to do and I believe I can achieve each one but I end up starting and locking my attention to one thing and forgetting about everything else which is causing me to fail my classes and lose focus

I do 90% of all the cooking, cleaning, earn more and work a 10 hour day. I have severe PTSD and have to be pretty fragile with myself aswell its not like I've got all the strength in the world. My SO is working and studying things were alright overall when he was just working. He blames his dysfunction at work for everything I suspect its a bit of both the world load and the fact his boss is basically abusive. He waited to long to find a new job and now we are royally screwed as that company is one bad job away from complete bankruptcy. I don't know what to do if feels like he's my younger siblings more and my SO and like my mom tapped out. When I was a teenager my mom would hit really bad depressive spells and I had to look after my little brother a lot. So in crisis I'm quite used to taking the lead and he's basically not noticed. I just sent him a message about it and spoke a bit about it last night he hasn't given me any solutions yet. I can't leave even if I wanted to because of finaces. No friends in this town moved in with him because I got work here. He might be depressed but if that's the case I've already recommend seeing someone he has medical aid that covers it I don't he has the resources to get help. But its deeper than mental its the fact he leaces at 7:30 am and gets home at 8pm every day. But I've just been putting in so much since we moved in together I feel like he should have started collage when we were a lot more stable and his job was way more stable. Its only a 3 month course one and a half left to to. I can't police my mental health, the entire house, my job, and his mental health.

I haven't really had much problem with bipolar on a day to day basis. I have had two manic episodes in my life, one of which was 8 months ago, one 5 years ago. I had zero issues coming off lithium 3 months ago. I got really fat on 300mg Seroquel XR so I'm tapering off that too. It's been around 6 days since I last had any.


I don't feel manic or euphoric. I don't feel anxious. I don't feel good though. I feel ok, but I also feel a bit like I drank 1 cup of coffee too many. Irritable and a bit sweaty. 


I took two weeks off work I don't go back until the 20th 


I have a rent inspection on Tuesday so I need to do a bit of cleaning. It probably isn't a lot but I just don't feel like it. I don't feel bad, or depressed. Just lacking in f*cks and a bit scattered.


I also have ADHD and this is all feels more ADHD than bipolar, but I had my ADHD pretty dialled in when I was on Seroquel. 


Just want to talk I suppose. If I didn't have the rent inspection I would have zero issue just veging out. 



I have a script for lexapro 20mg I am probably going to pick up to tonight or tomorrow. But it takes a few weeks to work so it won't help immediately. Idk. 


I don't know much about bipolar tbh I dont have typical symptoms or at least nothing that wouldn't be explained by ADHD. Just twice in my life I had a manic episode with psychosis symptoms and the medication helped with that.


It was nice sleeping super soundly on Seroquel but I am sick of wearing my boyfriend's clothes because I got too fat. We were going to start a family soon (I'm 35, have been in a loving relationship for nearly 4 years) and the plan was to taper down (I consulted with a  psychiatrist who specialises in clients who are looking to get pregnant) so that could happen but I lost  interested in having a baby/child while on mood stabilizers and now I don't know. He was really excited at the thought of being a a dad and I was excited to feel like I was finally ready. But now I don't know if it was  mania or just the deadening effect of the medication.

"I had to talk my mom into talking me out of grippy sock jail, bc I am toeing the line of a mental break. I haven't been on medication in a while and when I was on it was just abilify 20 mg and nothing else. No therapy, not even from an actual psychiatrist, if was from my PCP. I have been slipping for a while now but have been ignoring it which I know isn't the wisest thing to do with bipolar, but I never said I was the smartest. 
I have had no genuine joy in a long time. I don't do anything I use to enjoy and have no motivation to do it either. I am so empty inside and I don't know what to do or who to turn to, bc I can't go to grippy sock jail bc I don't think I can handle that even though it would probably benefit me in some capacity.

"Iâ€™ve been on Depakote 500mg for about a year.  Never really experienced depressive episodes before.  Just manic.  My manic episodes tend to have a lot of rage and anger woven in.  

 Iâ€™ve been feeling significantly depressed the past few months Self isolating, feeling empty, suicidal ideations(but not actually suicidal), sleeping a lot etc.  the works.  Iâ€™ve expressed this with my psych over the past 3 months and she kind of just always brushes it off.  Iâ€™ve tried SSRIs in the past, probably 4 of them, and they all have always had some powerful side effect.  Suicidal being one of them.  So she always says â€œwell I know you donâ€™t do well on anti depressantsâ€ and kind of just leaves it at that.  Of course I can tell sheâ€™s concerned but not concerned enough for me if that makes sense. 

But at the same time Iâ€™m feeling depressed, Iâ€™m also recognizing manic symptoms.  Like being incredibly angry.  Instigating fights.  Being negative in a menacing way.  My boyfriend went shopping for me and brought it over and after he left I told him â€œf*** you, I hate you, Iâ€™m packing up my apartment and leaving the stateâ€ and heâ€™s a very patient person.  And is just trying to understand whatâ€™s going on.

Iâ€™ve read on multiple posts of people experiencing similar mixed episodes.  But this is a first for me.  I donâ€™t know what to do.  I feel hopeless and angry all at the same time.  

Can mood stabilizers become ineffective overtime? Should I reach out to someone? Do I wait it out?  How long will this depressive episode last?",bipolar_disorder

"Iâ€™m not sure if this will sound like a dumb question. I guess it should be obvious, major bad thing happens -&gt; get depressed or lifeâ€™s going great -&gt; get manic. But this hasnâ€™t really been my experience.

I used to be very fixated on mood and on the things that I do or that happen to me that would impact my mood. I used to track activities daily such as medication, caffeine, alcohol, sleep etc. anything that I thought might have an impact on my mood. 

However even though there were clear trends I was never able to actually get anything out of this because despite knowing the activities I would tend to do when Iâ€™m in a better mood I was never able to find anything I could do to actually improve my mood when low. So it felt fruitless and I eventually stopped. 

There are clear things that I tend to feel or do more often when in a high phase (eg. socialising, working, doing side projects, exercise etc.) however Iâ€™ve always felt like people say that doing these healthy activities will help you feel better, but for me Iâ€™ve found it to be the opposite; after feeling better I start doing these things.

I have long periods of high or low mood (lasting anywhere from 2-3 months to upwards of a year) and when I look at the times approaching or during a shift I donâ€™t see myself doing anything different. Itâ€™s like my mood changes randomly, or due to some reason I canâ€™t clearly see. 

The things I do or things that happen to me donâ€™t seem to change my mood too significantly. For example if I experience some kind of negative event, say being rejected by someone I was interested in romantically, I will react differently depending on if Iâ€™m in a high or low phase but that negative experience would never push me into a low phase if Iâ€™m in a high.

"From 2020 through July of 2022 I was in various states of instability. From extended mixed episodes to severe long-term depression with psychosis (leading to hospitalization), things with me were not good. 

Throughout this time my husband and I have been dealing with major life events. We bought a home and began major renovations on it, then had to move in while said renovations were still occurring due to major delays and issues with our contractor. As the project began to wind down, it was clear the issues with the contractor went far beyond not meeting timelines. We are still dealing with these issues and lawyers are now involved. 

As the workers finally left and it came time for us to unpack and actually move in, plus complete projects left undone by the contractor and that we had originally intended to do ourselves, I was still in the throes of my prolonged instability, barely able to contribute in any way. 

My husband led the charge, which is normally more of my role in our partnership, and took on most the work, dragging me kicking and screaming as needed to assist. 

It was so hard on him and felt terrible about it. I was trying, and he understood this but I had nothing to give. I barely wanted to live. 

For my part, during all of this, I fought for my stability, trying med after med, attending therapy weekly, changing psychiatrists even when my former doctor demonstrated he did not understand the scope of my issues. 

Finally in July of this year, I found the magic med combo and began to feel like myself again. I was finally *stable* and functional!!!

Months before, my husband set some pessimistic goals for house progress that we should aim to achieve by the end of the year. At the time, I agreed but I thought to myself there was no way I could make it happen. 

Several weeks ago, we not only met our goals but completed a slew of additional projects that neither of us imagined would happen anytime soon. We finished every major project we had planned. 

Since then, my husband has been feeling pretty exhausted. He carried my weight through a giant undertaking and has also had a lot of stress at work. He hasnâ€™t been doing much around the house in terms of regular chores. I had noticed, but I havenâ€™t minded at all. 

Tonight he apologized for not being as active with chores. I told him not to worry. We are in a 50/50 partnership but that doesnâ€™t mean 50/50 every day. He carried and supported me for so very long through the worst bipolar episodes of my life. The least I could do is take charge on the chores for a while allowing him to rest up. Heâ€™s earned it and it bring my joy to be able to support him now and not just contribute to the household but carry us both. 

This is stability. It feels so good. 

I am so glad I fought for stability even when my illness made me think it was impossible. Even when I couldnâ€™t remember feeling good or stable. Even when I wanted nothing but an endless sleep. 

I kept fighting and I am so happy that I did. 

Sorry for the long post, I needed to share this success. I hope this inspires others to continue advocating and fighting for help and answers. 

Also, shoutout to my husband for being such an amazing partner! I did not make things easy over the last two years but he loved and supported me throughout!",bipolar_disorder

"I've had crippling social anxiety for as long as I can remember and it just got worse as the bipolar set in. Apparently Ive had ADHD as well. 

Thinking back there were plenty of instances when girls were showing interest in me and I just misinterpreted it or overthought things. Some would just short of ask me to ask them out. Kind of sucks that society expects the guy to make the first move, although the only time I actually dated someone was when my best friend in highschool basically forced me too (which ruined our friendship), and 10 years later when a girl in my social circle asked a friend to set us up. A couple weeks after we started dating I was commited to a psych ward due to the manic episode I was in and never heard from her again.

Basically my head is too fucked to initiate anything or have it last. Any girl that I think might be into me I immediately start to have second thoughts about, despite VERY obvious signs in hindsight.  Here I am at nearly 30 and I still haven't had a serious relationship, and I dont even want go get on a dating app or try to talk to anyone now because I'm recovering socially and financially from a year long depressive episode and am in no position to start dating someone, which is obviously a recurring issue for me.

so last year around this time i was officially diagnosed and being treated for bipolar 2. i felt so much relief and i really resonated with my diagnoses. long story i had to go to a new psychiatrist and therapist. today i had my first meeting with the psychiatrist and i understand this is my first meeting and that things can change. he ended up saying he thinks iâ€™m â€œon the cuspâ€ of being bipolar but iâ€™m not â€œfull fledgeâ€ bipolar. which i mean i guess? iâ€™ve definitely been worse off but this year has been slightly better. he said he was gonna treat me for bipolar but that might change going forward. donâ€™t get me wrong if iâ€™m not bipolar i would like to know my actual diagnosis but he looked at my trauma history and said it seemed likely but just what i was telling him made him seem off (my memory sucks though so it didnâ€™t help). iâ€™m just kinda disappointed because i finally felt understood and now i feel confused again with my diagnosis. anyways i just wanted to rant and get it off my chest.,bipolar_disorder

"Today while I was out running errands I literally saw someone I slept with a handful of times while in mania (before I even knew what that was). I canâ€™t say it didnâ€™t trigger me but Iâ€™m hoping sharing here will make me feel less like awful about it. Iâ€™m also noticing that running into â€œbad decisionsâ€ is solidifying my bad feelings toward men.

My mind has gone back in time to protect itself. I keep reflecting on a very old relationship because it was the last time I really felt safe with a man. However, by the same token I was in the midst of being misdiagnosed over and over and so was he. Two train wrecks canâ€™t really co-exist. We were engaged and sometimes I regret that I broke it off because like I said Iâ€™ve never been safe or loved properly since then.

Iâ€™m struggling again today and I keep thinking â€œis it going to be like this forever?â€ Am I just going to relive every horror like it happened yesterday? Itâ€™s like I feel a tiny bit better and then stuff like what happened today happens. I canâ€™t even think about dating right now because I have too much going on but at the same time Iâ€™ve never felt more alone.

recently during summer break i managed to be relatively stable for 1 month by taking my meds on time, sleeping well, working out and avoiding drugs at all costs. but i feel like that is not possible anymore because my studies require me to pull several all nighters at times and work for really long hours. and my antipsychotic doesnâ€™t really allow that. iâ€™m supposed to take it at 8pm. but last year i used to take it really late at night or early in the morning just to keep my head clear and always be ready to study.

"Hi! It's the first time I've had long hair in about 4 years. I spent 4 years having short hair, and a year ago I decided to grow it out. Short hair was something I was insecure about, since I loved the appearance of long hair on me much better.

The problem is that it's been really hard to take care of, especially during my depressive episodes. (I am going through one right now, hence this post looking for advice.)

I have really bad hygiene during the lows, not taking showers for *weeks*. It wasn't as bad when I had short hair, I could take care of my hygiene easier since my hair wouldn't take too long to dry. But now that I have long hair to the middle of my back, I keep putting off showering because I loathe the feeling of wet hair. (My family doesn't let me use a blowdryer so I don't own one.) Sometimes I shower but not wash my hair, which still makes me feel disgusting since I can feel how greasy my hair is and how dirty my scalp feels.

I hate having to style short hair just for it to look decent. Having long hair makes me feel presentable, since I can easily tie it up in a bun to hide the mess from depressive episodes. With short hair, I feel like it shows more clearly that I'm not feeling the best lately.

So I need advice: should I sacrifice my appearance for better hygiene? Thanks in advance!",bipolar_disorder
"I was diagnosed as adhd at 8 years old and have been mediated for it since.

"Undiagnosed bipolar from 13 to 32. Initial diagnosis was schizo/mood disorder during high school. Then from 20-30 graduated to just clinical depression/ anxiety. At this point there had been multiple OD attempts and sporadic SH episodes. I've been on every antidepressant possible. Nothing helped. I began to feel like a guinea pig.

While on that med I had my worst manic episode to date. It climaxed into another attempt, a rubber sock retreat, and finally and proper diagnosis.

Doctors will demand that you take medications but then they will refuse to send a scrip for more than a month so you have to call the pharmacy every month for them to request a refill and when you call to inform the doctor you only have 8 days of meds left and youre worried because youre heading to an area that is very far from a pharmacy and then the doctor decides to wait four days to send your scrip and only after you have your mom call twice to remind also two voicemails have already been left so he FINALLY sends the scrip at 4pm on the fourth day but you no longer have access to wifi so you cant contact the pharmacy so then you end up just rationing your pills which you had already started doing anticipating this shit show and just hope for the best but also realizing its out of my control and now we will see what happens when you cold turkey a med youre not supposed to stop taking. ðŸ˜¡,bipolar_disorder

"I was on the phone with my father today after he recently put his notice into quitting his job of 26 years. As someone like myself who struggles with Bi Polar II, Major Depressive Disorder, and ADHD; I asked him if he was ever diagnosed with anything, considering the mental health issues in his brothers, our family, etc. 

He said that there was a point where someone recommended a psychiatrist to him, but he didn't go through with it. He's done well for himself in life, and I struggle to do the dishes, or get anything done most days. When we got to talking about it, he acknowledged that it is a real thing, but he tends to believe it's more of a temporary thing, or an outlook thing I guess. He said it could be a culmination of traumas people have faced in life, and how they may have not fully dealt with those things. 

I don't agree, but I also don't fully disagree, guess I just wanted to open it up here for discussion, since I know no one else IRL who has these issues.",bipolar_disorder

"Hi, 

  So Iâ€™m diagnosed with Bipolar 2 (22 y/o male). Itâ€™s not a consensus diagnosis with every doctor Iâ€™ve had in the past, but the symptoms align, and I can confidently say I believe I have it. Iâ€™m currently on Lamictal (at 75 mg), and Seroquel 50-100 mg for sleep.
  However, I do have what appears to be hypomanic episodes, that last quite a few weeks, and can persist for months. This last one, the one Iâ€™m in now, itâ€™s very tough to deal with. Hypertension, mood elevation, and many more symptoms. Unfortunately, Iâ€™ve never actually started to treat this issue until maybe a month ago (in denial), when I realized that my life would be extremely negatively affected if I didnâ€™t (possibly beyond repair).
   So yesterday, I went to the psychiatrist, and he prescribed me Vraylar. I was like â€œokay coolâ€, until I saw the price. Iâ€™m here in Florida right now, but Iâ€™m heading back up to Georgia, where my families plan wonâ€™t cover me. And Iâ€™m not really sure how I would be able to afford this medicine without insurance (I donâ€™t really know the solution for myself to get health insurance at the current moment). So Iâ€™ve decided not to take it yetâ€¦until I can seek out alternatives or figure out how to pay for it. 
   I think my goal would be to get another medicine that works well (with not 25 million side effects), and wonâ€™t cost me $1100.00, as Iâ€™m probably not gonna have insurance in the interim after I move, and I unfortunately do not qualify for Medicaid in Georgia :( . Iâ€™ve heard itâ€™s a really great med, due to little side effects. But i donâ€™t really want to start these samples, just for me to not be able to procure it once I leave the state next month. I havenâ€™t told my psychiatrist yet, because it seems like theyâ€™re only interested in my money, I donâ€™t want them to like not fill my prescriptions for the other stuff I have before I leave (which is sad).
  My parents seem to think that Iâ€™ll be able to just get this medicine for a cheap price, even without insurance, but my common sense tells me that would not be true, even if Iâ€™m considered indigent. 
   My manic episodes are just really not fun. Iâ€™m running on 1-2 hours of sleep for periods of weeks, and all the other typical symptoms. Depression I could care less, although Iâ€™m sure the Lamictal will start to really help for that soon. Iâ€™ve already noticed it makes me feel better. 
   Does anyone know of another medicine that could possibly help (not lithium) , and wonâ€™t exhaust my funds. Whatâ€™s worse is that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be able to get insurance though the job I have lined up, and until I get my mental health in order, I honestly have no business working a full-time job that would afford me that opportunity.
  Iâ€™m just tired of being like this. So any personal ancestors would be great.",bipolar_disorder

"iâ€™m prescribed to be taking 120mg of latuda to stabilize my bipolar 2. a few months ago, i was extremely agitated from my hypomanic state so my psychiatrist prescribed olanzapene to take with the latuda to help bring me back down. something i immediately noticed was that my sex drive was completely gone while taking both of those medications. once i was stable, i discontinued taking olanzapene and continued with latuda. as my dosage went up with latuda i noticed my sex drive didnâ€™t return. as a (probably horrible) experiment i stopped taking latuda completely for a few days to see if it would come back, and just like that a few days later i was all good. this realization has made it really hard to convince myself to take the latuda. has anyone also experienced decreased sex drive on latuda?",bipolar_disorder
"So for a couple weeks I didn't really notice at the time but I think I may have been hypomanic again. From about the 25th August I'd been feeling very good, more than usual. I had lots of business plans, plans to make lots of art, how to become famous online, spend about Â£170 on healing crystals because I felt that that was what I needed to get better. Ugh. Never even been interested in that sort of stuff before but of course it felt like a necessary purchase at the time. I'd probably been averaging 5 or 6 hours sleep a night and sometimes 7 or 8. Just generally very optimistic, creative chatty and in a great mood. This has come after about 6 months of consistently stable mood.

Anyways the last week and a half has been very up and down, mostly down. Now i just generally feel depressed, unmotivated and have given up on all the ideas I'd previously thought were amazing investments and plans that would change my life. Slept 16 hours today and cant get out of bed to even eat. Just feeling fed up I guess I am in fact not 'better' snd the happiness I felt could have just been hypomania creeping up on me. For the record I have been told that I am on the bipolar spectrum (cyclothymia, severe depression and bp2 symptoms for a few years now) but I don't currently have a bipolar diagnosis although I feel that is what the issue is here. 

I take venlafaxine 75mg daily which has been working great for the last half a year. Going to continue with this medication and hope it may ease what I'm assuming is now a depressive episode. Any thoughts or opinions very welcome, thanks you all in advance! :)",bipolar_disorder

"The band pulled me up from a really dark place and the euphoria was numbing. I had been stable for a long time. Life was dark but for reasons other than my diagnosed bipolar disorder. After this amazing feeling my mood started to swing extremely fast. I was either feeling high and full of ideas or just feeling apathetic, barely eating.  I've even felt miserable and high at the same time. I thought of it like a short ""post concert depression"" but everything got worse and worse and this all started  early in june. What I thought was the happiest day of my life, something life-saving would turn into a monster. I started to crave that ""high"", and now I can't enjoy anything of what I used to enjoy.

These feelings are exhausting. I feel so much shame, guilt, anger, excitement and disappointment. All at the same time. My future scares me. I've experienced such a high that everyday life, the normal life I had before summer, makes me want to cry desperately like a child and a part of me wants to denty that it's over.  My mind wants to be in that fantasy bubble forever and chase after the same feelings of euphoria.  I've been taking medication for years, but apparently this outsmarted my meds.

"I am so frustrated. My copays for meds have been going up recently so I called my insurance to find out what's going on. After over an hour on the phone, I discovered that they will only honor the ""$0 generics"" on my plan if they're ""preventative"" medication. The med in question is oxcarbazepine (an anticonvulsant) and I told them, well I take it to prevent manic episodes, so why wouldn't this be preventative? They suggested I switch to lamotrigine (another anticonvulsant) because that one is considered preventative. I asked why two drugs that are in the same class, cost roughly the same, and are both for the prevention of manic episodes are not billed the same. They couldn't answer, but agreed with me when I said ""so this is simply arbitrarily decided and there is no clinical reason for this"". 


I went online and looked up the ACA's preventative medicines list. It covers contraception, asthma meds, high blood pressure meds, and insulin. The discrimination against mental health issues is real. It's preventative to prevent an asthma attack or diabetic episode, but not to prevent a manic episode. Make it make sense!!!

"My ex (has BP) and I (MDD) were together for 4 years and have been broken up for 3. We remained in each otherâ€™s lives as friends; no romantic feelings. We would meet up once a month to catch up. However once covid hit I went extremely low-to-no contact with a lot of people due to going into another depressive episode.

Now my ex has always been the kind of person where if I donâ€™t reach out he wonâ€™t at all. He doesnâ€™t take any medication and is against therapy. I respect his wishes, and am ok with being the one to reach out. However, I do get worried whenever he goes no contact. 

On his birthday I wished him happy birthday and he replied. Then I was dumb and asked how was he and if he was still doing his usual life stuff and I never got a response.

"Everyone around me including my provider seem concerned that I may be on a course towards a manic episode. Iâ€™ve been super depressed the last few months but over the last two to three weeks Iâ€™ve become more energized and told Iâ€™ve been moody by my parents.

Iâ€™m hyper fixated on playing a specific video game (MultiVersus, itâ€™s a lot of fun and never ends because you just keep playing more matches). Iâ€™m also super fixated on reading Reddit posts (I even use my phone when Iâ€™m at the table eating). Because of this Iâ€™ve started staying up much later and went from 12-13 hours of sleep a month ago to sleeping 6ish or 7ish hours a night. Iâ€™ve also had quite a bit of anxiety but donâ€™t really do anything that would cause me anxiety- I blame it on the current vibe my household is giving off. Iâ€™m also apparently talking faster than normal.

My provider says that I need to put more effort into sleep and is giving me a script for hydroxyzine PRN to chill out. I think a lot of this is related to my ADHD that Iâ€™m not treated for due to my cycling. Anyone like hydroxyzine and is there anything to look out for? She said it may not work but to give it a try.

"Iâ€™ve been on 300mg of lamictal a day (150 twice a day) for about two years now, and it was significantly helping with my highs and lows, and I started taking buspirone for my anxiety in February. I had a lot of stressors during my last semester of school which caused me to go into a deep depression, so my psychiatrist recommended Cymbalta to me. I was nervous about starting an SNRI in addition to my other meds seeing as though it can cause hypomanic episodes when combined with Lamotrigine. Things got a little better so I decided to hold off, but recently my anxiety and depression have gotten worse again, this time with limited stressors. We just upped my buspirone to 10mg twice a day, but Iâ€™m still keeping Cymbalta in the back of my mind as an option. I know everyone is different, but I just wanted to ask if anybody has been on the combination of lamictal, buspirone, and Cymbalta, and what the experience was like.",bipolar_disorder

"I've been in a long depressive episode and I'm still going through it. I struggle with my job and basically debate quitting with my therapist every week because I just don't feel like I can handle it, but I'm trying to stay there. I only started in February and even though it's really hard, having the structure of a job still helps me. 

Recently, my co-worker was promoted and is now my boss. She's a workaholic, around my age and experience level, and very focused on empowering women in the organization. Today was our first one-on-one meeting since her promotion and she wanted to know my career goals, how I see myself growing, and what I want to do next. I tried to say that right now I'm just happy to have a job, but she was clearly disappointed with that answer. She said, ""I'm going to keep pushing you and make you uncomfortable, because this is important."" 

In my earlier work experience, I would have loved having a boss like this - one interested in growing me and helping me reach my goals. But right now, it takes all that I have to focus on the job I have (and might hate too, not sure how much of that is the job and how much of that is depression) and staying alive - I have no interest or motivation to move on to the next stage of my career. I don't even want a career. I just want to get by while I struggle with illness and now I feel like there's something wrong with thag. 

Is there anything I can say to get her to get off my back about it? I do appreciate her trying, it's just not time for me.",bipolar_disorder

"

Tl:dr: My doc keeps changing my meds against my wishes, Iâ€™m in a super bad place, and thereâ€™s no hope in sight.

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 later in life, after an in-patient stay in psych. Id already been in treatment for ptsd and on meds. I spent a few weeks there, we figured out some meds that worked well enough to release me, and the rest is, from what Iâ€™ve heard from other bipolar friends, is pretty par for the course. Iâ€™ve struggled with meds since then (that was in 2017), and have been up and down and everywhere in between. 

The past few weeks have been like nothing I have ever experienced before. About a year and a half ago, I started the process of changing meds (that weâ€™re working very well and I was in a very good place), so that I could start trying to get pregnant. Each med change made things worse, and eventually I told my doc I wanted to stop with the med changes and go back on my original ones because it was so bad, I didnâ€™t even want to get pregnant anymore. All my mental health care is from the VA, so I get new doctors all the time finishing their residencies. This doctor has been refusing to put me back on the meds that worked and keeps trying new things. 

I called and talked to another resident yesterday and broke down. I told her I couldnâ€™t live like this anymore. That this isnâ€™t living. Iâ€™m a night worker, and I have absolutely no control over my sleep whatsoever. I go between being awake for 3-4 days straight to sleeping for 24 hours at a time. My husband is mad at me during those 24 hours because I canâ€™t wake up, I canâ€™t be active. He physically cannot wake me up. Iâ€™m either slurring my words or talking way too fast. Iâ€™ve spent about $4500 in the last 2 weeks. The worst thing is, for the first time since my in patient stay, I called out because I canâ€™t handle the thought of going to work like this. I cry all the time. I sobbed my way through the phone call with the new resident, and she didnâ€™t really have anything helpful to say or do except â€œtake a walk outsideâ€, because apparently thatâ€™s the cure for everything. I canâ€™t even get out of bed. 

Im not looking for advice, or armchair diagnosis. I just want to know if anyone has gone through this before, and what happened. Thank you for reading this far, if you have.",bipolar_disorder

Need a little advice.
Work has been hectic. PTSD/BP2/ADHD/PMDD do not clash w/ the corporate world. Not at all.
We have a big project and Iâ€™m lagging behind because of psychosomatic issues and otherwise psychological distress due to unearthing some ~trauma~, not to mention that my bosses have been communicating my tasks to me in a piss poor way. Iâ€™m doing my best with what I have and donâ€™t have and whether or not these people are satisfied with my work I stand by my decisions.

Docs arenâ€™t working w/ me for whatever reason and Iâ€™m frustrated that Iâ€™ve been trying to communicate my needs to everyone and Iâ€™m not being taken seriously.

"Hello all I have an interview later on today. Around 6 or 7 years ago I first found out I was bipolar, I had a state doctor that looked after me about once every couple of months and would fill my medication. At one point he decided that what I was doing wasn't good enough and he completely changed my medication. He didn't wean me off or anything and it spun me into a manic episode. During that time I stole a couple t-shirts which I didn't need. I had a job at the time I could afford them. But it happened and I got arrested and it's on my record. Shortly after this the doctor just stopped showing up to work and I was transferred to someone else. I imagine I'll be having to spill this to any potential employers.

So I ask her, wait what makes you say Iâ€™m in denial? What is it that Iâ€™m in denial about?

"When either myself, my mom, my cousins, my uncles, or anyone who knows the family speaks of my papaw, we inevitably bring up the capacity he had for storytelling. All true stories, mind you. Papaw had a way of luring you in to wherever and whenever his stories had taken place, as if by magic. We all usually end these discussions with one of us uttering, ""I wish I had a tape recorder back then..."" 

I never inherited Papaw's gift of gab. I always end up playing with my hair or looking at my phone or otherwise getting distracted whenever I try to verbally convey a story to someone. Besides that, people just don't take me seriously. When I do make a serious attempt to tell a story without getting distracted, the other person gets distracted! I don't command a presence the way my papaw did, let's face it. 

I am learning that I have my own skills. I've been reflecting on my college days a lot lately and how, to an extent, I used my bipolar to my advantage. That strategy could have crumbled very easily, but that isn't the point. The point is, I learned that, at least when I'm depressed, I'm a creative writer. 

When I was in college, I studied philosophy, and I minored in linguistics. The linguistics minor required so many hours of creative writing courses. One time, I submitted a piece I had written while I was manic. The piece was an extended metaphor based on a philosophical paper I had read that used a hypothetical example of a man who spends his days counting blades of grass. The piece did not go over well. Some of the other students didn't understand it at all. The others who did form an interpretation of the piece each had their own idea about it. There was no consensus, and, overall, the piece was jarring. I still earned an 'A' for the originality and eloquence of the piece. 

I found that I did my best creative writing when I was depressed. That is when I got to the bare bones of what was real to me, the raw stuff, and what wasn't. My junior year of college, I had my first stay in the psych hospital. I won't go into details, but I will say they still missed my bipolar! Anyway, after I returned from there, I ended up writing a piece about it. I got mixed reactions from the class. Some felt the piece too relatable to even comment on at all. Others shared their own personal stories with mental illness and began crying. Some read bits and pieces of it and avoided going any further. I got an 'A,' as well as kind remarks from the professor, which was a rarity. 

I'm currently doing trauma work and DBT with my therapist. In DBT, there is a concept of ""dialectics,"" the idea that, in most situations, there is a middle ground. I went from the extreme of using my bipolar to my advantage in college to taking steps to actively avoid it altogether. And when I couldn't do the latter, I'd blame myself and go down negative thought spirals. Perhaps a more reasonable approach would be to avoid the bipolar symptoms, not the bipolar, as much as I can, not altogether, and find my strong points during each episode to focus on. 

In the mean time, I do want to start writing again. I feel it in my bones. That's why I've been posting so much on Reddit. I guess answering people's questions takes away the personal responsibility of thinking of stuff to write about. The thing about writing, at least for me, is that sometimes I have trouble finding a topic. But once I get my momentum going, there's no stopping me. 

My mom has said for years that I should write a book. I'm not quite that ambitious. That creative writing professor I had did try to persuade me to change my major several times, but I never took him up on it. I was so passionate about philosophy at the time. It's still one of my passions, though I don't read as much as I used to. Anyway, thank you for reading.",bipolar_disorder

Now I feel like such an erratic psychopath that everyone is forced to tolerate - family, friends, roommates, etc. Doesnâ€™t make any sense but I canâ€™t get the idea out of my head that my roommates and friends have separate group chats for the sole purpose of talking shit about me behind my back.

"M22

I am not doing well (less well then usual). I was a straight-A student on track to being valedictorian before bipolar disorder hit towards the end of my time in high school. I had such a bright future. I played piano constantly, learned new things, but Iâ€™ve gradually lost interest in everything.

Nearly 5 years later and now Iâ€™m in my final year of university. I was BARELY beginning to handle bipolar disorder and it seemed like things might turn out ok. Then one night, I had what I believe was auditory hallucinations. Thatâ€™s a huge worsening of the situation.

I finally got myself back at the gym today after not going for over a year and a half. Working out has been a consistent thing Iâ€™ve done since a teenager and in the past couple of years I havenâ€™t been able to keep up with it. My mood was so much better when I was working out but once you lose motivation itâ€™s hard to get it back. Right now Iâ€™m the heaviest Iâ€™ve ever been 40lbs overweight. My last episode of depression involved stress eating not losing my appetite like usual plus the medication I was on made me put on weight. I hope to go back to my normal size or at the very least improve my mood and get stronger. Ive been walking my dog twice a day for the past 3 and half months so this was the next step I wanted to accomplish.

"I get a lot of questions from family about dating/marriage especially since I'm getting older and almost 30. my younger cousins are either in serious relationships, engaged or married. I tried to explain that I simply am not interested in dating. hear me out

I admit I have a fear of rejection. I have an even bigger fear of vulnerability. thinking back I remember why I became so withdrawn and closed off; I was ""disciplined"" a lot growing up even for the smallest things. sometimes I was just being a kid and I'd get hit. I'd get yelled at or told to shut if I said something ""stupid"" (I realize now I was just being a kid or teen) or for expressing myself. it kinda hurt when everything you said was ""stupid"", especially when you'd get told that in front of other family (like at gatherings and such). eventually, you just stop talking. then you stop expressing yourself. lastly, you become withdrawn. I shut myself off to other people. I barely want so share my interests for fear of being called stupid or laughed at [I really love old school music and crate digging. I've invested in some dj equipment because I really enjoy mixing! I wouldn't dare share that with anyone else in person though].

in my turbulent 20s I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I tried to put myself out there and date but to no surprise, it didn't work out and I've been rejected a lot. I can handle rejection when it comes to anything else: jobs, applications or what not, I can deal with that. for some reason, rejection from personal relationships is a different type of sting. to avoid it, I stopped trying. any time I was vulnerable and opened up about my feelings for someone, I was always rejected. I'm not at all saying that people don't have a right to not be interested but it seems like at some point somebody would at least say yes. I admit, I'm not attractive at all, but I invested lots of time and money into a nice wardrobe, keep my hair done/cut makeup and everything. I never looked frumpy if I was trying to attract someone. 

In 2020, I opened up to a man that I had been talking to for years and told him that I had feelings for him and he didn't reciprocate and in so many words said 'aw thanks'. now I 100% take responsibility for that. this isn't his fault at all and he was right to feel how he felt but I should have been smarter. I told myself later that the reason I felt embarrassed was because I was stupid enough to express myself. ""why'd you do that? you knew better. why'd you think he was gonna be nice about that. you should have known better. that was dumb. you deserve that"". I also told myself that was the last time I'd ever do that. you never let your guard down. you never let anyone know where you're coming from and you CERTAINLY don't allow anyone to hurt you.

unfortunately, my 20s have been laden with rejection in different forms. it can be quite painful. I admit I'm sensitive. I don't like it but I am. my household always viewed sensitivity as weakness. you are never supposed to be weak.

**Iâ€™d much rather not catch feelings/feel anything at all for anyone than catch feelings and have to process them and get my feelings hurt again. I canâ€™t take that anymore and I absolutely refuse to.**

I'm not at all sure if that's irrational at all. I absolutely will share this with my therapist because I need to process all of these thoughts. I made a mistake and instead of distracting myself with doing something I sat down to think.",bipolar_disorder

"I feel like many of my issues resulting from my bipolar stems from my lack of communication with the people in my life. When Iâ€™m in distress, people will try and help me, but as I try to explain how I feel, I get lots of feedback asking if I really think Iâ€™m bipolar. Iâ€™m told that I am telling my myself a story in which I created that is causing my mood to fluctuate. I have a tough time explaining that it is in fact my bipolar. But no one really takes it seriously. Because â€œIâ€™m young and life is hardâ€ so of course Iâ€™d be feeling the way I do. I know itâ€™s out of love and wanting to help, but I donâ€™t know how to express when I am feeling distress that it is in fact, my bipolar.

"Iâ€™m a 27F and my whole life Iâ€™ve struggled with my mood and for the past 10 plus years Iâ€™ve really struggled with sleep. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder because of my anxiety but I do wonder whether there is more to it. I came off my anti depressant (mirtazipine 7.5mg and then upped to 15) two months ago which I used for sleep. Initially I had withdrawals then I had an intense low energy mood for a couple of weeks. Iâ€™ve struggled with sleep a long time but in these two weeks I had intense anxiety, struggled talking to people, extreme sensitivity and intense fatigue. I slept a lot. Then all of a sudden I woke up and the anxiety had gone, I felt confident and didnâ€™t have any social anxiety what so ever. I felt like my concentration was exceptional but when I had to write something at work I physically couldnâ€™t write the sentences and thought I was going to lose control. My thoughts were Racing and the only way I can describe it is my energy shifts up and so does my self esteem which I know is common in bipolar. I was extremely agitated, restless and the need for sleep went away. This only went on for a couple of days however as I spoke with my doctor who has put me on mirtazipine and I still feel the restless anxiety but it makes me so drowsy that I am able to sleep now. I am worried because Iâ€™ve had this feeling before which caused me to lose my job in the past and the only way I can describe it is the increase and then decrease in energy. When I donâ€™t have this I do feel some what normal and when I was taking mirtazipine I had periods of normal, confident and no social anxiety but then Iâ€™d have periods of anxiety around my time of the month and Iâ€™d struggle to sleep. I feel itâ€™s difficult to talk about because I have so many things going on at once and I canâ€™t fully explain it. I also struggle with health anxiety and possible OCD which complicates things.",bipolar_disorder

I swear anybody can play this game and enjoy it caters for young and old, if you can't jog in the spot there's even a ""silent jogging"" mode where you can jog with less impact (never used it but it's supposed to be just as much as a workout) even my mom is playing it and it's cheaper than a gym membership in the long run.

"  Hello, I (18F) love my boyfriend (18M) very much. We haven't been in a romantic relationship for too long but have been good friends since we were 10 yo and were in the same friend group in high school. We both started college at different schools that are in our native state (US) and are only 30 minutes away, so we get to see each other on the weekends. As far as I'm aware, this is a sufficient amount of time for both of us as we tend to spend the entire weekend together and get picked up from school and dropped off together, too. We also talk on the phone for hours everyday. This is my second relationship (having dated another member of our friend group last year) and my boyfriend's first.
  In the past week, I've thought about what it would be like to be on my own. Having this thought really scares me and it sneaks up on me at random points in the day and I feel extremely guilty for having it. I wish more than anything that it would go away.
  I had a large spur of hypomania about a week to week and a half ago that left me very career driven and with intrusive thoughts of picking up and leaving everyone and everything and moving somewhere by myself to fulfill my aspirations, even though I know that that is illogical. It has been since this where I have gotten the equally as intrusive thought to step away from my bf and I got very genuinely scared by this idea. I have become more depressed since coming down from hypomania and I've had pretty bad anxiety as well, and have a history of getting intrusive thoughts that reflect my current anxieties, and this is definitely one. 
  My first relationship also ended pretty poorly as I was broken up with suddenly and totally unexpectedly. I developed a lot of relationship anxiety over this and it literally shattered me for months and I'm still a different person than I was before, though I have mostly recovered and absolutely no not want to get with my ex again. My current bf treats me exponentially better and he truly wants to be my forever partner and I want him to be just as much as he does. It's the most comfortable relationship that I have ever been in, and really I'm very happy.
  Additionally, I haven't made any friends on my college campus, I do everything by myself and I don't even have a roommate. My boyfriend, on the other hand, hangs out with our friends from high school that go to his school, including people from our friend group. I'm very happy that he has these connections and I'm not bitter about it at all. I just feel as though the loneliness gets to me sometimes. I talk to my boyfriend, my family, my best friend, and other friends over the phone often, but I don't socialize much in person on the weekdays. I also feel like I am on too much of a fixed routine that is challenging during depressive periods and unsatisfactory during hypomania.
  (TLDR; my first run in with what I believe is self sabotage that makes me feel as though I want to leave my bf who I love very much. I wonder if the self sabotage comes from my past ex, my mental health, and my college environment and schedule) 
  Sorry for the long description, I just wanted to get everything on the table. I've also never dealt with self sabotage before and I feel as though most of this comes from what I had mentioned above. I'd like opinions on whether or not this is self sabotage and how to manage the intrusive thoughts when I know that I love him. Anything would be appreciated, thank you.",bipolar_disorder

"Hello, I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice. I was referred to a mental health team in 2011 for assessment following six years of recurrent depressive episodes, and because I'd started to worry family with my behaviour, which was ""out of character"" (on one occasion, over about four months, I vacillated between being extremely promiscuous and obsessed with sex, and feeling wracked with shame, guilt and depression. I couldn't seem to stop myself from acting recklessly when it started, and then felt like I had no control over who I was. Another occasion saw me spend four months obsessed with starting a career down South that I have no aptitude for - spent a ton of money attending conferences for practicing professionals, and every waking hour studying and applying to universities... I was barely sleeping and wasn't eating normally, my only focus and interest was this new life I was planning, till I went to an interview and sat a mock exam paper to test basic knowledge of the subject - and I couldn't answer any of the questions. I have no recollection of getting home (the five hour train journey and changes). 

The psychiatrist originally hypothesised it might be cyclothymia or bipolar, but of course he'd need to see me over a period of time to evaluate. That was fine. I was put on mood stabilisers along with the antidepressants I was taking. A few years later we were discussing which of the two disorders was most appropriate - he read out the two ICD 10 definitions and asked what resonated. I said I didn't think it could be cyclothymia as I'd experienced multiple major depressive episodes by this point. 

I was hospitalised for a depressive episode not long after, and both my intake and discharge forms state that my diagnosis was ""bipolar affective disorder"" and ""bipolar affective disorder, in remission"". But then, around 2019, he said that I didn't have bipolar disorder - he didn't believe in Bipolar II as a diagnosis, and I didn't meet the criteria for bipolar I. My family doctor didn't agree with that assessment. 

Eventually the psychiatrist left and I felt able to ask for copies of my medical notes. I combed through them and found example after example of being labelled bipolar. The only thing that said I wasn't was the letter the psychiatrist sent to the GP when she'd written for clarification. 

On my medical notes just now, I am listed as having two active psychiatric conditions, recurrent depressive disorder and Unspecified Bipolar affective disorder. What is ""unspecified bipolar affective disorder""? Is it different from bipolar NOS?  This was updated to the system after my discharge from inpatient psychiatric care. 

I feel like my experience was invalidated. Yes, the instances of hypomania have become shorter and I've not feel truly out of control for a long while, but that's because I've been taking my medicine and going to therapy. I'm worried that being labelled as having unspecified bipolar affective disorder means I won't be taken as seriously. 

TLDR: originally diagnosed as bipolar in run up to psychiatric inpatient admission. Treated with mood stabilizers (antipsychotics then anticonvulsant) and antidepressants, and therapy. This is recorded in my medical notes. The psychiatrist then changed his mind (five years later) and said I didn't have it at all, but I believe that's because he doesn't find bipolar II to be a valid diagnosis (although it appears in the ICD-11). Is unspecified bipolar affective disorder a type of.bipolar? Why would they use this subtype?",bipolar_disorder

Is the solution to just give him space and then talk about it when he's feeling better? We're long distance, so I can't just pop over there to check on him or sit with him through his feelings. I also know depression lies to people and makes them feel unworthy/burdensome.

"I have bipolar 1. I randomly feel overly emotional. Often for mere minutes. Sometimes I'll be happy, sometimes sad, sometimes empathetic. It happens in mood episodes and outside them. It isn't cyclical or predictable. It isn't a typical reaction for me either. It's been happening for all of my life, yet fleetingly and randomly. I don't know if it could be related to bipolar or not.

It doesn't happen often, but occasionally I'll get deja vu combined with panic attacks. The deja Vu is about random boring stuff.  The panic attacks never occur without the deja Vu. It's just really weird as I don't have PTSD or trauma. I don't have seizures or any medical condition that would cause the deja vu. It's really weird.

I obviously canâ€™t diagnose him, but my dad is a narcissist and I am still dealing with that trauma to this day. I donâ€™t want the same for our son.

He was just quiet most of the day, he wasnâ€™t really communicating with me but I figured he would snap out of it. We ate lunch together and shortly after I fell asleep in his bed for a quick nap. I felt safe and trusted him, I rarely take naps around others because they can be so disorienting. Well, I woke up and he was gone.

I asked his roommate what happened and he said my bf told him he was â€œgoing outâ€ and had a duffel bag on him. He said heâ€™d talked to me abt it too, which just isnâ€™t true. 

Itâ€™s been 3 days and the only communication Iâ€™ve had with him is 2 one minute conversations where he tells me not to look for him because heâ€™s â€œundergroundâ€ and that heâ€™s going to fight the kkk and thereâ€™s a new world order.

Unfortunately this is going to be the end of our relationship as I cannot possibly build trust back after this, but Iâ€™m worried about his pet hamster, his roommate, his rent, and the fact his mom had made plans to come see him next week.

"In 2021 I was diagnosed with depression, prescribed Wellbutrin and got married. We had a honeymoon in Costa Rica that went astray. Everything is easier in hindsight but I should have seen the signs that I wasn't just depressed. Wellbutrin and stress of the wedding put me in a manic state. This was my first and only full blown manic episode, I also experienced psychosis for 3 days. The episode led me trust certain certain people I shouldn't have , it got me in fights, multiple near death experiences and a great deal of trauma. but the worst was that it led to the destruction of my relationship with my wife.

&amp;#x200B;

1 year later, I have decided to go back to Costa Rica, to face my fears and trauma. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the stress of returning. I have made a plan with my psychiatrist and therapist to adjust my medication if I start experiencing symptoms.

"Hey everyone! For a year I have been living in supported accommodation for people with mental health problems. I have a social care worker due to needing to have my needs assessed so I could get a placement at my current tenancy. I have been wanting to move on to live in my own home as Iâ€™m currently living with 6 other people. A lot of the residents at my house take drugs and are drunk most of the time which I feel like impacts my mental health being around that energy. Iâ€™ve been doing well mentally, my mental health team are very pleased with me. I mentioned how I would like to move out of my current accommodation but was told by my social worker that I lack the mental capacity to move out. I donâ€™t lack mental capacity maybe if Iâ€™m manic I can make unwise decisions but Iâ€™m currently very mentally well and I feel I would benefit from moving into my own place. When I moved into supported I was told by the manager of the house that it was up to me when I decide to move on. I only moved into supported because I felt I could benefit from having support with certain tasks such as food shopping but Iâ€™m managing very well without needing support hence why I feel I am ready to move forward. Itâ€™s very frustrating and is making me feel sad that Iâ€™ve been told I canâ€™t move into my own place. I donâ€™t know what to do about the situation, itâ€™s all a bit bizarre to me. I did discuss this with my mental health nurse/care co-ordinator who agreed that I should move to my own place and even said that I could still get support even in my own residency. I feel like nobody is listening to my perspective and I feel like my social worker is not listening to me and the reasons why I would like to move into my own home.

"This is my first post to this sub. Iâ€™m 22F, obviously bipolar and Iâ€™m on mobile, also Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m still manic or not so if thereâ€™s weird wording or Idek thatâ€™s why. 


Being prepared is very important to me. Being prepared for anything, any possibility in any situation at all times. This is not extraordinarily healthy for me, however, being prepared helps me and anything that helps me and isnâ€™t entirely self destructive Iâ€™m gonna try to do. So everyday, in every situation, I prepare myself. I prepare myself for what my day has in store for me, I prepare myself for the possibly easy things could go wrong, I prepare myself for anything I can think of. 

Obviously, there are things I can not prepare for. I try to do my best to handle it and move forward but lately, when Iâ€™m manic and things go wrong that I did not prepare for, I canâ€™t get over it. All I can do is sit there and think over and over and over again â€œthis wasnâ€™t supposed to happen, this was not supposed to happenâ€. I try to move forward and figure out how to deal with this situation I am now in but I just donâ€™t know how. Itâ€™s something I havenâ€™t prepared for and I just get stuck. Is anyone else like this? How crazy am I? Lol",bipolar_disorder

I'm at home with him full time after leaving my job when he was born. Sometimes, like today, I feel so hopeless and detached, and guilty for bringing him into all of this. I feel regretful knowing I brought a life into the world when I couldn't even find a reason to live most of the time myself.

Hopefully I will be able to make an appointment with my PCP soon to get on the mood stabilizer that was recommended to me (Wellbutrin) by the neuropsychologist who diagnosed me. I'm also in therapy twice a week.

Sometimes it's pain. Sometimes it's anger and aggression. Either way, in both cases, I feel like there's going to come a day when I can't hold it in anymore.

My husband has a diagnosis of bipolar type2 with rapid cycling. He doesn't accept it and doesn't want treatment. We have struggled with this for years but finally has the diagnosis. He's dad has bipolar type 1 and bother too. Anyway for a few years he's condition has gotten worse. I had a journal keeping up symptoms and things that happened during episodes ( i was convinced he has this as his family and was trying to have proof to show him). 

Anyway, he was loving and the most beautiful husband ever during the happy manic time :( , then when the depressive cycle would come he would be completely distant and said we should separate.

Since last year things have gotten worse and worse and this year he went from 4 months of loving amazing time to telling me he was going to file for divorce and asked me to move out. Now we're separated because i can't take it anymore and during the time I'm moving out my stuff he goes from why are you moving ? To ,when are you done ? Is really hard.

Therapist told me to not take it personally and know he doesn't want treatment and i can't do anything else. He also assaulted me during an episode so I'm forced to move our for my safety. 

I know the psychiatrist that talked to me said he has a severe case and asked me to help him during this time while he decided to get medicines or not.

"I have bipolar 3 which isn't exactly the same, I experience hypomania which feels great for a few days and then deep depression for a week. The fact the cycling is so quick is a double edged sword. Yeah it passes fast but it restarts just as fast and it's so exhausting that I'm not functional. Some people find that w bipolar three the phases aren't as intense, but I've found that only to be accurate for the manias. My depressions are intense and dark. My psychiatrist doubled the dose of antidepressants I was on so nonchalantly too like babe what are you doing!!!! So here I am once again cycling through moods having to go back to my parents place even though I moved out (which now I'm honestly regretting, I really thought that I'd be more stable. I had a solid three weeks of being sane and functional then boom that's over back to being unhinged)

Like how am I supposed to accomplish my difficult ass dreams (I chose the violin. Seriously like what's wrong with me. I'm not bad at it I'm actually pretty good I have 6 years worth of playing but I'm not in school and catching up to college level has been a challenge but I've been making real progress even despite the cycling. It's just that the episodes aren't ending and auditions are coming up and I really can't live like this, in the nether, for another year. I need to be actively working towards my professional career because without that sense of order I'm totally lost. I feel like I'm going nowhere.) 

It's been nine months of being experimented on with different medications, different combos, so few have worked. I hit the jackpot with Abilify for a solid few weeks but the emptiness and loneliness got so much I cried in my psychiatrists office. It's like I have no good options anymore: either I'm cycling and totally dysfunctional, or I'm completely numb and empty. And at this point I understand that maybe happiness is unachievable for me, maybe if I could just be stable that's ok. You know? I have to settle. I just wanna be normal so bad. Worry about grades and getting enough protein instead of whether I'll ever get out of this state where, even in my stable periods, I wish I were never born. The instability, unpredictability of this mental disorder has completely stripped me of all agency I had over myself, and I wish I had a way out.

I was on 1200 mg lithium until reducing 2 weeks ago and had been taking abilify 2 mg until starting pramipexole 5 weeks ago. I feel like I'm getting a response from pramipexole -- am more optimistic and having some good days and am tolerating the bad days better. It feels like I'm starting to remember how to enjoy things and be engaged with the world. But on the whole I'm still depressed and feel pretty miserable.

I wanted to ask this group what others experience with the end of their depressions are like. Is it gradual? Ups and downs for a while then the downs slowly dissipate? Do you wake up one day and realize you're well again? It's been a while since I've been here and probably in the past it was more I learned to live with it and then maybe one day forgot I was supposed to be depressed. I'm really not sure but am hopeful I'm seeing signs of a breakthrough.",bipolar_disorder
"Dirty carpets and flickering lights.

"When I was younger, people said I looked like my mother.  This was true for a while but eventually people stopped comparing us.  My mother was abusive, schizophrenic, refusing help.  Growing up was complicated and hard, and eventually in my adult life, I cut contact with her, and it was for the best.

Iâ€™ve retained the idea that I looked like her and the image I have seen in the mirror for the past 20 years is a person resembling my mother almost as a twin.  It doesnâ€™t help that I have not aged much in the past 12 years, people call it great genetics but it was a curse for me.  Iâ€™ve hated looking at myself, it reminded me of her, it kept bringing back trauma. 

I am a person whoâ€™s mostly manic and hypomanic.  I rarely slip in depression and I have ADHD. Figuring out that I am bipolar and needed help took many years. Now Iâ€™m on antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and I believe Iâ€™m finally stable for more than a week at a time.  It has been years since I have been stable for a long period of time.  My delusions disappeared, Iâ€™m finally rational and Iâ€™m seeing things around me differently.  Not all my problems are solved, of coursed but medication has made my state of mind manageable so far. 

A few weeks ago, I walked past my bathroomâ€™s large mirror to go to my shower and I saw a glimpse of myself. I recognized the woman in the mirror as the same one on my selfies.  A woman I though only existed in pictures, I saw myself, finally. 

This is the strangeness of the situation, when I took selfies, I always found myself extremely pretty on the pictures.  Back when I was dating online, I kept apologizing to my dates, saying how the camera loved me and how I was not as pretty for real.  When I would meet them, they would tell me that I looked identical to my picture.  It just wasnâ€™t what I was seeing in the mirror. 

This time however, the reflection on the mirror was identical to the selfies I take. I completely forgot the shower was running until the mirror fogged up, I was just staring at something I had never seen before.  Turns out, I absolutely donâ€™t look like my mother! I found a lot more traits from my fatherâ€™s side of the family than my motherâ€™s side.  The only ressemblance with my mother is the shape of the forehead, which I can hide with my hair.  Even my hair didnâ€™t look like my mothers anymore, I was seeing something completely different. 

This event got me thinking. Now that I have been stable for a few months, I finally got to meet myself and reconnect with who I am under the blanket of bipolar disorder.  I no longer have obsessions, but I have a few hobbies, which according to my therapist is healthy. Iâ€™m not erratic anymore and I have discovered someone who has very good patience.  I found someone creative and grateful.  My personality has changed and Iâ€™m experiencing things with a reality filter I did not know I possessed.

In therapy, while talking about my mirror moment, we started exploring PTSD, body dysmorphia and itâ€™s roots in delusions.  All my life I was hallucinating what I was seeing in the mirror, mirrors being a trigger of a traumatic event I had almost forgotten about.  With the help of antipsychotics, i was able to stop my hallucinations and delusions.  The mirrors no longer distorted my self image. 

Now the only thing I fear is becoming manic again.  I know it is bound to happen at least a few more times in my life, and I am prepared for it to happen. I have a strong support system, people who care and love me.  I am enjoying being stable so much, I am scared about how I will react when it is taken away from me by my own body.  I try to enjoy every day, as if tomorrow I wouldnâ€™t be myself, even if that moment hasnâ€™t happen in a while.  I finally reconnected with myself, I hope I continue being stable.",bipolar_disorder
"Ok for some background context iv been talking to this girk for a month now and everything has been going good, she mentionted she is bipolar but I didnâ€™t pay much attention to it. She recently told me she didnâ€™t enjoy talking to me anymore and called me a â€œgreat friendâ€ but she said she doesnâ€™t feel like talking to me anymore, so i said no big deal and went to bed and it really didnâ€™t bother me that much. What bothers me is that she wrote to me the next day and said that she didnâ€™t know what she was saying and basically blamed the thing on her being bipolar (she hasnâ€™t gone to do a diagnostic) and that she wants to start talking again. I said that a sorry would suffice but now it was too late for that. Now i have no idea what to do. Sheâ€™s kinda extroverted but really shy when talking in person. Especially when i am  around.

"Some people I used to be friends with had a big ""abolish the police"" sign posted in their front window of their house. One of them also bragged to me about throwing glass bottles at police officers during the 2020 protests. When I was in manic psychosis I went and threw a rock through the window with the sign to call their bluff. No surprise: They called the cops and tried to get me thrown in jail. Pretty cool! I know it was obviously wrong on my part but I am kind of like....lol take your sign down posers

/ I obviously am sorry for throwing the rock and paid for the window. I don't even remember doing it and was completely out of my mind. Part of me though thinks it's funny.

She's going to go to a higher up and tell them that she sees that I'm suffering from bipolar which my psych has yet to confirm even though I've been hospitalized from a manic episode and was diagnosed in the hospital.

"So I have a question to anyone thats gone to therapy via video sessions: have any of you successfully gone back to a provider after the 3 strikes rule??....So heres the story: apparently I've missed 3 appointments in the past 4 months and there is a rule ~that I wasnt aware of~ that after 3 missed appointments you're then blocked from going anymore. The part that seems very unfair to me about this rule is that I noticed my appointment was scheduled 10 minutes early on the app when I logged in to start the session than it said in my phone and on my calendar and that was strange because I always write down and double check the time+day as they're scheduling me at the end of each of our sessions for our next session so I never get it wrong, also the fact that I did try connecting several times and as soon as I felt it was pointless to try and connect anymore I called them to let them know that I infact was NOT a ""no show"" yet even after I explained they sent me a letter saying:

""Due to multiple missed appointments or late cancellations we are notifying you that all non-emergent Behavioral Health appointments have been put on hold and will remain on hold until this situation is resolved. 
To clear this matter up, we request that you meet with a representative to review these concerns and work out an agreement. The department representative will contact you within 72 hours""

Someone did call me 20 minutes later and basically told me ""you need to find a different provider"" it wasn't even a discussion, I didn't even get to explain anything or ""resolve the situation"" I even asked if there was anything I could do and she said ""no you have to find another provider"" and then hung up....I really don't want to wait 6+ months to ""find a provider"" who is then just going to refer me to someone else and then it goes on and on for...I think this last time it probably took almost a year :(((

I've been told:
- that i basically just need to be positive and it will get better 
- that now that I've been diagnosed everything will be alright and I'll never experience an episode again
- that it will naturally get better with time 
- that ""if I don't want to get better I never will"" (like if I didn't actively look for help and made the choice to go to a clinic to get diagnosed and treated)

These things were all told to me by people I really love and they made me feel like shit, honestly. Every time I try to explain what it's like to them it feels like they regard it as a choice or as something I can just turn off. No, thinking positively won't solve the fact that I'm depressed, and even if it did, there are all the physical symptoms that are exhausting. Like I have to force myself to eat because if not I would go days without it, or to sleep more than 2-3 hours when I'm manic.

My best friend was diagnosed with bipolar 2, last week. Her doctor told her to read more about it and educate herself on the matter.

As soon as she was diagnosed, she started to blame all her shitty behavior this year on bipolarity.

I did some independent research on bipolarity before and now that I know her diagnosis, I'm digging even deeper so that I can understand her better.  But it seems that all she does is try to explain every single shitty behavior using bipolarity. For example, a couple of months ago she kicked me out of her house and now she's saying it was one episode. She was also mean to other people.

I texted her the night she was diagnosed telling her that she's much more than this diagnosis.

She seems to like this whole maniac thingy; our last conversation was all about her wanting to purify the world by killing all human beings and creating a utopia and keeping people who are stupid by your side because they are faithful and blind.

"Hello everyone,   


I am in a relationship with a girl I love deeply. Our relationship is great except when she lose her temper. She can be the sweetest girl ever but as soon as a little thing doesn't go as she planned - she goes, within a second, into a ""full anger mood"".   
She will likely be mean to me even though I did not do anything and it is really painful.   


We discussed it and I told her that she does need to change if she wants me because I won't handle it forever.  


She is totally aware of this problem and suffer from it. I told her that we can always change to become better versions of ourselves and that as a boyfriend I am here to help her dealing with it.   


What would you advice to help her be in control of her emotions ?   
I have been medidating for some time and it helped me a lot, I am sure it can help her as well but I am looking for any good tips !   


Thanks a lot :)",bipolar_disorder

Life does what it does and has thrown me in the last 2 months. I went from owning a successful business to filing a bankruptcy and starting over in a new job. The way I managed myself was keeping a strict schedule,  regular therapy that's all gone now.

"My (20) partner (20) and I have been together just a year. I knew they had bipolar before we got together, and believe that overall the two of us have navigated any difficulties or mood swings really well as a pair. Iâ€™m always there to support them whenever they need it, and generally any bumps we have have been resolved within a day (no matter how explosive). However this past week Iâ€™ve noticed a significant shift in their personality, and Iâ€™m really concerned. Weâ€™ve had huge fights every single day, which have always been prompted by a bunch of text messages from them to me about a number of pretty hurtful things explaining how Iâ€™m making them feel with my actions. From my perspective what they are saying feels often irrational, and very out of character. Theyâ€™ve gone form bouts of anger to sobbing tears and back again in the space of a few hours, and then even after al of it they seem so fragile and sensitive (far more than usual) that I canâ€™t even talk to them about how their comments made me feel. Honesty at this point it feels as though Iâ€™m being gaslighted into believing things about me and how I behave that I know arenâ€™t true. This time of year is particularly hard for them due to past trauma that occurred during this time, and so I believe t behaviour is in part stemming from that. So for now Iâ€™m swallowing my opinions and upset, as I love this person deeply and know that now isnâ€™t the time or place. However once the dust has settled in a couple of weeks, Iâ€™d like to know how to tell them what itâ€™s been like for me without them becoming angry or deeply hurt. I also want to express my concern that this is a depressive episode without them freaking out or getting annoyed. Does anyone have any experience or suggestions that may help?",bipolar_disorder
"I wrote this as a response to another post, but deleted it as it felt like I was hijacking their post. 

I would describe angel numbers as a repetitive sequence of numbers (111, 222, 333) that you notice. Each sequence supposedly has some meaning, some message from hugher beings. Of course there a TON of spiritual and/or non-bipolar people who simply just believe in angel numbers. But coming from someone with a bipolar diagnosis, what do you think? Could this just be a sign of mania/hypomania?

I've read people on this sub mention sequences in license plates specifically. However, I personally notice sequences with the TIME as opposed to license plates. I'll randomly check the time and see it, more often then not. Sometimes so often it would cause a sense of dread. 

Since July or so of last year I've been hyperaware of the time when it's double/triple numbers. Like, I for some odd reason see the time 11:11 consistently. I also see times like 3:33, 2:22, 12:12, etc. Earlier this year it started bothering me so much that I spoke to my Mom and told her I keep seeing double numbers and I think its a sign of impending doom, so I needed to update my life insurance policy in reference to beneficiaries. I even sought out a Psychic, though I didn't mention the numbers to her.  I eventually started Googling it and ran into the term ""angel numbers"", and read that it's not a BAD omen like I assumed.

I still notice those hours atleast once or twice a day and get a little uneasy, though. Not sure if this is just me being superstitious/paranoid or a part of maybe... hypomania?

by chance i am seeing dr. ****  tomorrow afternoon.... funny timing.  so i'm seeing this as a moment of awareness - a point of light in my darkness. tomorrow i can talk about it and process it more. 

i am really sorry that i alarmed everyone... i'm really sorry - we always show and impose our worst on the people we love, and who love us most.  i know it can be forgiven and accepted, but i'm just so sad and sorry that i'm like this, and that it comes out in the damagings ways it does. i don't mean to hurt anyone. i hope someday it will stop.

"Iâ€™m not sure if mods will allow text conversations to be posted hereâ€¦

Basically I reached out to this person, referred to as J (7+ years of friendship), about struggling with my mental health lately. Iâ€™m diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and the depression is absolutely devastating me at the moment. 

J is very aware of how bipolar affects me in daily life. They have not always been the most understanding, but I wouldnâ€™t expect anyone who doesnâ€™t live with it to completely get it. However we have been on holiday together several times and they even took me to hospital once. 

Over the last year or so, J has really bettered themself - no longer drinking, smoking, exercising all the time - you get the picture. 

While I was very happy for them, not being a huge party girl myself for obvious medication reasons, J began to change their entire approach towards anything mental health related. 

For example, â€œwhy do you need to take medication? Just go for a runâ€

â€œYouâ€™re over-complicating things. Just donâ€™t think too much about having a mental illnessâ€

â€œHave you tried cognitive behavioural therapy?â€ (that one made me laugh out loud)

J got me down more and more, if I had to cancel a plan, theyâ€™d tell me Iâ€™m a victim to bipolar, and that I should fight it more. I take all my medication, go to therapy every week, stick to a rigid routine to manage depression/hypomania but the nature of the beast, for me anyway, is that I will always â€œdipâ€ once every few months. 

Today was the final straw for me. I stood up for myself, for the first time ever. Something Iâ€™ve always been too afraid to do with J because they have a knack of making me feel about an inch tall. 

J abruptly ended our friendship. Saying theyâ€™ve done nothing but be there for me. In reality, they never tried once to be patient or supportive. They repeatedly called me a victim and that I â€œenjoyâ€ being mentally ill. 

I needed to vent this to a community who can understand or has maybe been there myself as Iâ€™m overthinking now and Iâ€™m afraid I overreacted in calling J out on their behaviour â€¦",bipolar_disorder

"I love my boyfriend, but I also have infatuated thoughts about someone else

I am in a very happy relationship but I also get euphoric, infatuated thoughts about someone else

I am in a very happy relationship with my boyfriend. I love him a lot, and I trust him with my life. 

But I also have these moments, more often than not (even before we dated), about how connected I feel towards a former highschool friend I used to befriend with. I will look at media, fictional characters, listen to music, that all hold some certain connections about my feelings towards this girl.

It's not the same type of love I feel, like how I feel to my boyfriend. I am in love with her, but not in a normal way people feel. But there's this feeling of infatuation. She made a big impact in my life, but I haven't spoken to her regularly in a long while since we parted ways to different colleges (it has been 4 years since I graduated highschool) so you see, I really yearn for her to be back. No romantic relationship or friendship could really bring me the feeling that she instilled to me... 

I feel like some of the songs I listen to, the media I consume, were all written for me and me only. All for me to find. Some of it may look like it has nothing related to her, but I can find meaning behind them. I almost feel like they were all written for me. And sometimes, when I think about her hard enough, a lot of miracles happen. I think she may secretly want me back as much as I want her, but I'm scared that she wouldn't feel the same way if I ever decided to open up about these feelings. I don't know why I get so envious whenever I see her pictures with someone else. I want to be there with her but I'm not. 

This is... A very weird feeling for me. I am braindumping my thoughts as I write everything down, so I hope to anyone reading this, to be able to understand what I'm saying because I feel like I'm not speaking coherently. This feeling I have towards her is indescribable. The feeling of loss, even though she's still well and alive, the feeling of anticipating that maybe one day she'll make a move to me, it's all very strange and I cannot comprehend why. 

I feel horrible that I even have these thoughts because I love my current boyfriend (and he is a big sweetheart for not being offended that I experience this), I feel safe with him, I couldnt ask for anyone else, but it's just.. these thoughts almost plague me everyday. I don't know what to call them. I think it's wrong for me to have these thoughts? But I also don't want them to go. They make me feel euphoric.

"Hello! So Im currently aware that I am having q manic episode come on or q mixed episode with now more manic symptoms ($200 spent in one hour on impulse buying at the store, rapid talking, anger/irritated more easy, feeling 'squirrel-y' if that makes sense?)

I am luckily qble to rationalize more than my previous episode this year but its possibly due to the fact that my ADHD meds (which have been increased a little over a month ago) actually help me calm down qnd prevents the hyperactivity of my ADHD from ramping up the mania faster. 

A few hours yesterday after my ADHD meds wore off and it had become dark I became more erratic and ended up 'casually' hallucinating an interaction I had with my family to be different from what actually happened and it made me really angery at myself and I did somw target behavior. 

I didnt realize I had hallucinated at first because the first time and only time I've hallucinated so vividly I was more 'out of it' and more emotionally riled up with my mood swinging from qnger ro giggling to crying. 

This time it was a general interaction with none of my emotions (to me) fluxing like that but one that still stress me out. Somehing happened before that that I interpreted as one thing that might of set the 'stage' for the whole hallucination to 'support' it. Maybe a delusion?

If it wasnt for me confinding in (and somewhat confronting) my sister both times about what I ""saw"" and her being like""wtf your talking about, thays not how it wrnt down"" and fact checking me (like 'reenacting the memory and the surroundings not being able to logically match at all to the memory) then J probably wouldn't of realized the truth/reality to calm me down.

I hope Im making sense and not rambling too much. I realize somw triggers is 1) morning meds wore off, 2) its always dark out, 3) there is something I assume about a situation/others motives thst is a precursor to the hallucinatjon that lays the 'theme' to support the assumption/view and 4) the hallucinations are to get me more angry/riled up/speed up my mania

Can anyone gove me tips to combat/be more mindful of possible hallucinations in the future? Im scared of tonight tbh, my meds are in effect but Im still 'feel' the manic buzzing flair up on my chest/thr anger or irritability and feeling ghr urge of needing to go go go or want to do MY thing and no one rlse fucking bug me.

"Iâ€™m in graduate school right now completing my masters degree. During my first year of my program, I was untreated and undiagnosed, experiencing severe episodes that were interfering with my performance in school (and life) resulting in my having to take incompletes in most of my classes (most of which were resolved to No-record-COVID, so I didnâ€™t receive credit for them). I took a year off from the program after that to focus on my health and was diagnosed during that time, and now Iâ€™m back. Iâ€™ve been working heavily with my program coordinator to get back on track, who is also in charge of student health and wellness, and I plan on meeting with her to let her know about my diagnosis/my anxiety about it affecting my future schoolwork after what happened during my first year. I am not worried about this creating any problems, as she is super supportive, but I am still nervous to disclose this kind of information.

"Morning everyone,

My girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for almost 3years now (mid 20's). She has medical issues with Bipolar disorder being one of them. I believe she's been medically diagnosed before but doesn't actively take any medicine that seems to effect it besides ADHD medicine.

*By actively effect it, I'm not saying the ADHD medicine is helping, I just mean her mood changes when she takes them.*

Anyway, the reason I am here is I need help from this community. The time we've spent together has been wonderful but very challenging! She can have fits of rage where any little thing I do can set her off. She breaks up with me at least once a month. She can go into rollercoasters of emotion where within 30mins she'll be completely happy, depressed, mad and restart the cycle. 

I went through a phase where I truly thought I was as bad as she was making me feel. Recently I've tried to look through a broader lens and it's not just me. Anyone whos close to her and she's comfortable with will get the same treatment eventually.

How can I help her and in-turn improve our relationship. 

The way it's been recently is not sustainable for the long haul. I've asked her to get help and I genuinely think she tries but when she hits a wall, whether the office doesn't have the room for another patient or there isn't one covered by insurance close enough to drive, whatever the reason she then shuts down and loses all motivation. 

Please, any and all advice welcomed",bipolar_disorder

"Instead of cutting, I like to do a squat as low as I can.

Remember to keep the feet shoulder width apart, and only allow your knees to extend to the tips of your toes if you try this at home. Good form is important for preserving your joints.

But basically, I'll drop into as low a squat as I can, which by now, is all the way down.

Then I'll just hold that until I feel like I'm in enough pain. I take a little break, then squat low again.

I have done serious hard exercise to prevent the impulse to hurt myself in a non-positive way.

I like to do heavyweight squats when I can.

"Hey everybody, I'm 18 and suffer from porn addiction. I started my journey of recovery 2 years ago and stoped masturbating for 120 days during my longest streak with the help of the NoFap community. I do feel like i use porn just as some people use alcohol, to vent from their reality. Especially during depression and during the highest points of my hypomanic episodes i am closest to relapsing. But while i feel like i got to change the whole world during mania and hypomania, i feel as if i can't be bothered to waste my time with porn. I would rather have sex during those times. During depression on the other hand, combined with the aspect of isolation, i waste days on days with my addiction, preventing me from even trying to get a stable lifestyle. So here's my Question:

"Iâ€™m a 34/f I was diagnosed with ocd anxiety depression and mood disorder. Iâ€™ve had problems with my mental health all my life but it really intensified after I had my second son at age 30. I had a shitty child hood. I was abused terribly and lost my father at the age of four suddenly.

Iâ€™ve been hospitalized once for akathasia after I took myself off of risperidone cold turkey, by a doctors advice. I suffered 7 weeks of anxiety and akathasia and thatâ€™s why I went to the hospital.

Since then Iâ€™ve had different meds. But finally a combination of medications seem to help abilify and anafranil.

I have a problem staying on my meds bc antipsychotics give me overactive bladder. And also my husband does not want me on medication. I feel like he hates me for my mental health which did not become so bad until after we were married six years. He abandoned me when I went into the hospital the first time for my anxiety . Heâ€™s a good man just very insensitive to mental health. My husband believes that my medications are doing more harm than good to me and heâ€™s afraid of me being on them. 

My husband thinks that over time of being off my meds I will naturally heal and I need to dig deep with therapy for my mental problems bc the pills are just band aids. 

I for the second time have come off abilify and itâ€™s been three weeks. And once again I feel like complete agony. So depressed and anxious. I came off the abilify to see if any changes would happen with my bladder and I have seen great improvement but my mental health suffers. As you can guess, my husband doesnâ€™t want me to go back on the abilify. 

Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t know what to do. How am I supposed to be ok when the person I love the most wonâ€™t support me and my need for medication. I feel Iâ€™m a constant disappointment.

I have a fair amount of online/distance friends and they're great and I love them but I'd love to have a social sphere of people to do stuff with (go to clubs/parties/clubs, try new things, exercise, etc) irl.

"My paternal grandmother was diagnosed schizophrenic and spent her whole life in and out of mental hospitals until she passed from a heart attack in 1975.

"This isn't a purely bipolar story, but I'm going into a depressive episode (the first in quite a while) and I'm finding myself ruminating on old memories from my first major depression.

Way back in my first year of college, I started dating the woman who I would eventually marry. We had actually been good friends for years and just gradually realized that we were becoming more than friends. Anyway, after probably 6 months of consciously dating, I started going into a depressive episode and that's when she decided that we should break up. It was a shock to me since I thought things were going really well and the timing of it sent me into absolute chaos. To make matters worse, she gave me the ""I'd like to be friends still"" line and I believed it.

In the next few months she created space for herself, but we had the same group of friends and frequently ended up in the same locations. My friends kept telling me that being around her wasn't good for me and that we should go do other things, but I just wouldn't listen. I wanted to be with her, believed that we were supposed to be friends and couldn't understand why she was visibly annoyed by my presence. I should mention that I'm also autistic, so social cues are kind of a mystery to me and were especially so when I was younger. I expected everyone to just say what they meant, so the ""we're friends but not really"" concept was completely foreign to my thinking. In retrospect, I would have been a lot better off by just breaking contact entirely and letting my friends support me, but young and emotionally unstable people don't tend to make the best decisions.

Sometime a month or two after the dumping, I attempted suicide. I didn't tell her that (never have), but she must have known that something was up because she convinced me to go to a doctor shortly after. I got on antidepressants and then slowly improved over the next few months and started to accept that she really wasn't my girlfriend any more.

Here's where the confusing resentment comes in. Around the time that I was just starting to feel ok again, we were socializing and she started holding my hand and asked if we could get back together. I was really ambivalent about it, but said yes anyway. I still wanted to be with her, but also had the sense that it wasn't the right time. I needed more time to recover and have space of my own, but I felt like if I refused then it would be a whole new breakup with all the pain that I just couldn't go through again. We went on to get married and have stayed married for over 20 years, so it wasn't a completely bad decision, but I still feel that it wasn't good for me emotionally and I've been holding on to that ever since. 

In recent years, I've been becoming progressively more resentful about her asking to get back together. It's confusing because we have a good life together and I'm not upset with her over the initial breakup even though the timing really sucked. I don't even think she did anything wrong by asking to get back together if that's how she felt. I'm disappointed with myself for not doing what I needed to do for me at the time and I think I resent her because she was part of the equation. It's really starting to have an impact on our relationship, but I don't think there's any way to talk about it without coming off as an absolute dick. She would be right to be upset and hurt by me bringing up this of all things after 30 years. How can I even explain my feelings without sounding like I regret our marriage? I don't know. I can generally just avoid thinking about it, but the memories come back every time I start getting depressed again. This time is even worse because I've been remembering the suicide attempt as well, which I haven't thought about in a long time. Hopefully this won't last long because I'm really feeling like I'm going to collapse and really don't want her support this time. It just hurts.",bipolar_disorder

The healing process is hard but this reunion made me feel positive, which is what my friend stood for and nothing but! He was my cheerleader and confidant, his diagnosis and my own.

My friend got cheated on a couple of weeks ago. They told me that they were still talking to them and that it was hard to cut them off because of their mental state.

Mostly I just feel my heart speed up and slow down over and over again until I (hopefully) am able to fall asleep. Has anyone here dealt with that? Have you found a way to treat it? Iâ€™m really trying to do everything I can to get balanced but itâ€™s difficult when you have an adrenaline rush whenever you shut your eyes. Iâ€™m on risperidone if that makes any difference.

"Hello! I hope this is an okay place to reach out. I am hoping to get some insight or advice. However, if this is not an appropriate setting please let me know! Or not, just removing the post works too... ha.. 

I am unsure where to start, so I will give a little background. I am a trained mental health professional.  I have a clinical therapy license, but quit that work a few months ago and now work solely as a School Counselor.  I have been given an assessment for bipolar disorder before when I was trying to get a gastric sleeve. They never gave me my results, but I was able to get the surgery. I have a hard time with mental health assessments because I am familiar with them due to my work and I know the purpose or direction of the questions.  (I am not trying to sound narcissistic,  just I used to give those assessments)

Here is my concern.... bipolar disorder runs in my family.  My grandfather, my uncle... those are the ones I know of. I am familiar with it both personally and professionally.  I don't have episodes of mania, I am okay at managing my money and I am not quick to leave my work. However, I have extreme episodes of depression.  Like... the only reason I am getting out of bed is because I have kids to feed, I can't shower or take my meds, I struggle to eat, can't talk to people, and I cry all the time. Then it eases up, and I am good for a while until suddenly I am not. I struggle to find a pattern, rhyme, or reason.  

I have been diagnosed with PTSD and I am pretty okay with taking those meds, when I am not in an episode, but I stress about these events. My life has always been like this.  

So, here is my major thought/concern. Is this similar to bipolar II? I have clinical suspicions but we are strongly difacouraged from self diagnoses (its a slippery slope) How do I bring this up with my doctor? I feel a weird sense of shame, embarrassment,  and protectionism.  How do I bring it up with partner?",bipolar_disorder

"Hi I have bipolar II (diagnosed in the last year or so but have shown symptoms my whole life).

I recently moved back in with my parents and as much as I love them itâ€™s been a hell storm. My mom and I are such different people and we argue about everything and when Iâ€™m manic I just get so agitated. Itâ€™s like I have the ball of energy in my chest thatâ€™s telling me you have to do something drastic. During these times Iâ€™ve randomly broken up with partners, driven hours away with no destination, spent wicked amounts of money recklessly, intense sometimes scary sex, etc. (classic stuff.)

But recently because Iâ€™ve been fighting with my mom so much, Iâ€™ve reverted back to some habits I had when I was younger. When I had episodes as a teenager, Iâ€™d just punch whatever I could get my hands on that would cause me pain and that would lessen the feeling. Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m eventually going to break something in my hand because Iâ€™ve been doing it on and off for years (always some pretty bad bruising but never a break [i think]).

Iâ€™m trying to find things I can do to alleviate that intense feeling of too much energy without hurting myself. Any suggestions?",bipolar_disorder

My mother failed to inform me that bipolar disorder runs in the family- a direct line from her fathers side. It varies from fully functional to permanent hospitalization. 

Iâ€™ve been through the ringer of medication trials and twice a week down to once a week therapy. My prescribing doctor has me on 42mg of Caplyta and 25mg (2 weeks, then 50 for 2, then 100 for 2 and we go from there) of Lamictal. Iâ€™ve been on Caplyta for 14 weeks now and we just added the lamictal 5 days ago.

Iâ€™m scared because I have had bad reactions to bipolar medication, and I know the possible reactions of Lamictal. Iâ€™m looking for any advice or success stories of anyone going through the same. I need to know Iâ€™m gonna be okay. The Caplyta works, just not enough. Iâ€™ve had very minor hypomanic episodes but no mania.

Generally speaking, what on earth do you think is going on here?

Do you identify with any of his behavior?

"Hi, This is my first time posting here. I'm 22 and i was diagnosed with BP disorder 5 or 6 months ago.My main concern is that i can't stop overthinking or as i call it ""my head doesnt stfu"". I'm a med student so i pretty much now a lot of the meds and that stuff. I like my carrier but i still think i just decide to study med because i want to be usefull just to prove my self im worth living. Now a days i change a little bit my mindset and just think with indifference about myself and im caring more about others, with this i mean that basiclly that if it was for me i will probably be dead but i dont wany to hurt my family and my friends and all the love and caring they gave me. I just feel that me alive is a pain in the ass and just a waste of money for my parents. Also i think that if i finally finish with my own life will be the same thing and i will just leave pain  and sadness. Now a days i just cant stop thinking that i dont deserve anyone to love me or choose me. In my personal life as my love interest i just think i will be a curse that no one deserves. I also think I dont deserve to have kids or have a family in the future. My mind just told me every day that i dont have big aspirations or dreams as i use to have when i was younger. I love people with passion and a really hard will i just enjoy being with them and them talking to me about their dreams and future aspirations. But i think it is because i dont have my own ones and this just drive me to the feeling  that I really dont deserve the love i receive and caring. That i person like me dont have the right to ask for much in a partner but that for me is  just  disgusting cause i also think i dont have the right to tell who is a lot or not. I just take the responsability of every bad thing or sad thing thst happens to me and also think i am predisposed to that. I know im young but i just think i aint mature enough and also i dont make and effort to be more mature. Im scared of new things, im scare of growing, im scare of driving a car cuz i think i will just crash and hurt other people, i cant sleep i have insomnia, and when i finally sleep i just have nightmares of me dying by any possible way and wake up 2-4 times in the night. Im scare of myself and that one day i just will go crazy and hurt someones feelings or worst than that hurt someone physically. 
To end my post i want to say that im sorry if i was to hard and i know that not all people with BP disorder feels like me. What im trying yo say is thst im not generalizing,but this is the way i feel about myself right now",bipolar_disorder
"My grandma was my best friend. She passed 11/26/2013. The anniversary of her death fucks my bipolar up in all kinds of ways.

Throughout my entire childhood, I slept over her house at least once a month. I'd call her &amp; ask, ""Hi Grandma, can I sleep over tonight?"" But it wasn't a question. 

Senior year of high school, I actually lost a friend because I had bought a car &amp; she wanted me to take her to Taco Bell or Wendy's during lunch break. My grandma lived around the corner from my school so I wanted to spend my lunch with her. No regrets there. 

Throughout college, we had McDonald's breakfast every Wednesday. Her favorite was their Pancakes &amp; I'd get her a Mango/Pineapple smoothie to save for later. I'd also pick her up every Friday morning to bring her to her friend's house. I'd go in &amp; sit with them for a few minutes, doing my best to ignore the fact that my grandma's friend was watching Sean Hannity on full volume. &amp; feeling so thankful to have a grandma that knew Sean Hannity was a piece of shit.

Then before I knew it she was dying. Granted, she was 92yo...but it always feels sudden when you're young. I'd lost people prior...but this was my first real punch in the gut, ""what the fuck do I do now"" loss.

To this day, she is present in my life. Despite not being physically present. I have a ""grandma shelf"" in my apartment, I wear her necklace, I wear her ring, I think about her whenever something good happens &amp; wish I could tell her about it. But she's not actually here, which does make me sad.

So I've been doing really well. I'm thriving at work, I've been stable on my medication regimen for a long time. However, I always decompensate in November. It's not even a conscious thing, it's not like I'm always thinking about her...there have been times in years past that I didn't realize I was having an anniversary reaction until I was deep in it. But I haven't gone a year without one.

My grandma was only around for the beginning of my struggle with bipolar disorder. I'm kind of thankful she never had to see me hospitalized or fully struggling but I do wish she could see how well I'm doing now, how far I've come.

Anyway, I just wanted to vent. &amp; talk about how much I love my grandma for a second. &amp; if you have a grandma that you're close to, cherish every moment. 

Thanks for reading.

"TLDR: I understand that lithium and alcohol donâ€™t go well together, but Iâ€™m wondering if I can have a beer every 2-3 weeks.

I want to say first that I understand that lithium and alcohol are not really supposed to be mixed. I have no intention of getting fucked up while Iâ€™m on this medicine. 

I want to know if I can have alcohol in any capacity. I donâ€™t really need to get drunk, but I like knowing what the drinks my friends are having taste like. Iâ€™ve not had drinking problems in the past so Iâ€™m not really worried about getting addicted either. I just want to drink a beer with my buddies every once and a while.

"Iâ€™m so fucking livid. Went to see a nurse practitioner at a new place. Got my appointment canceled on a Friday so I had to wait till the following Wednesday to see a different NP. Luckily I had just enough bi polar meds. 

I was stable so all I need are refills. Thatâ€™s it. The moron NP prescribes me the wrong bi polar meds even though my bottle was right in front of her. I get told by the pharmacy it will be 1-3 days to fill my meds. So Iâ€™ll be without them. I see on the second day on the health app itâ€™s the wrong bi polar med. So I call and talk with someone to tell them she prescribed the wrong one and which one I really need. They say theyâ€™ll relay the message. 

Today on the 4th day I havenâ€™t heard from the pharmacy so I drive down there just to get a few days worth of bi polar meds because I feel my mind fucking up. My meds were ready and they never called me. Come to find out, again, itâ€™s the wrong bi polar med. I take Divalproex DR. For the second time the med was Divalproex ER. Even though I called to tell them it was wrong before. 

They tell me the donâ€™t have  Divalproex DR in stock and itâ€™ll be in after 1 on Monday. Thatâ€™ll be 6 days without my meds. I drive to my old pharmacy and they are closed this weekend. Iâ€™m on state health insurance and so fucking livid with theyâ€™re actions. I was stable and now Iâ€™m fucked.

Many of the items hadn't been bid on yet, and so I did what anyone in my state of mind would do and started tossing my money at things. $10 for a candy basket here, $15 for a Tupperware bag there.

Then suddenly I saw it. A ""$1250 Value 2-Night Stay"" at a lodge that sounded nice. The starting bid was $315 and I thought ""Heck yes!"" I put aside $500 for a vacation for me and the hubby anyways, so this was perfect. And besides, I figured I'd be outbid quickly.

Nope. No following bids. I finally looked up what the actual lodge looks like and omg you guys, it is a cabin in the middle of nowhere with bunk beds. BUNK BEDS. And no plumbing in some of the rooms. Very rustic, and I'm not sure what we'd even do for two days. ðŸ˜­ Why do I spend money on shit I haven't even done my research on????

In November i was depressed for about 3 weeks but no suicidal thoughts so i thought it was seasonal depression

In April i was really depressed to the point where i was refusing to do school work, crying everyday, faking being sick so i didnâ€™t have to go school. My performing arts teacher was worried for me and asked if i was getting sleep (i wasnâ€™t) and i was already going to the school counsellor, but halfway through june i became happy again and i thought it was over.

When i came back to school in september i became so determined like it was the only thing i was able to do. I was so focused and i was getting the grades i wanted. My teachers were proud of me especially my performing arts one. *drug use* I found vicodin like a ton a packs on the floor and decided to just take them. i took a few everyday and it increased. during those times i donâ€™t remember a lot since itâ€™s like a blur. iâ€™ve become depressed again and i feel like all of my hard work will go away and iâ€™m going to dissapoint my family and teachers again. my friends have been noticing my very quick mood swings with anger and sadness and idk what to do. i feel stranded and i want answers

"I decided that it's time to tell my story. Perhaps it will help others here. Perhaps it will just help me to vent about it. I used to be an EMT, then an ER Tech, and then an RN. Back in 2020 before covid hit I started seeing a counselor for depression, PTSD and alcohol abuse from all the shit I'd seen. After a few months we agreed that medication might be a good idea. During this time, my wife was pregnant, covid hit, and we were moving to a new state, living temporarily with my sister-in-law and her immunocompromised boyfriend.

My primary care doc at the VA prescribed Lexapro shortly after my son was born. You can guess what happened next. I had some kind of premonition; I was very reluctant to take it and even got a second opinion before starting it. But, the consensus was that it was a good choice.

I felt amazing for about 6 weeks. We had a newborn and I had no problems getting up to take care of him. I was up at 5am frying up ridiculous quantities of eggs and pancakes. I bought a new computer and workout equipment. I stayed up late playing games on ""the night shift"" with my baby. Then the trouble started.

I began having extreme hypersexuality. It was so intense it felt like I needed it like I needed breathing. I was having panic attacks when my needs weren't met. I signed up for porn sites and compulsively downloaded every video I had access to. I had online affairs, chasing after sexual connection like a junkie looking for a high. It was entirely unmanageable. After about 8-10 weeks I came off the lexapro but they symptoms only became a little less extreme.

My psychiatrist put me on lamotrigine instead, which helped for a time but only really took the edge off. I kept rationalizing what was happening to me; I was in a sexless marriage (and still am, it's been over 2 years now). I would say ""Of \*course\* you're obsessed with sex. I think deep down I knew something was wrong, and my wife knew something was wrong, but we couldn't quite put a finger on it. My shrink had a suspicion about bipolar but she never actually made the leap.

During all of this I was fighting through a crucible of stress. I was a new nurse working an extremely difficult unit, during covid, with vulnerable people at home. We were house shopping in one of the most difficult markets in decades. I had a newborn. I was working nights. I had no friends in our new state (we moved to be closer to my wife's family).

The lamotrigine stopped working at some point and the hypersexuality came back full swing. Looking back at it now I was probably hypomanic to some degree or another for nearly a full year. In the end, I placed a camera where a camera didn't belong, and things blew up. I lost my job, I lost my nursing license, and we lost the house we were 2 weeks from closing on. My in-laws kicked me out, and I spent the summer semi-homeless going from airBNB to airBNB until my mother was able to help my wife and I purchase a condo.

In the days following the incident I checked myself in to a psychiatric facility and almost immediately was diagnosed as bipolar. It took a couple of tries but I'm on zyprexa and lamotrigine now and I feel pretty much ""back to normal"". Unfortunately, however, I was charged with a crime, and I've had it hanging over my head for over a year now. Next week, I am pleading guilty, and I am going to jail. The sentence is 9 months but hopefully I'll only serve 6. I'll also have 4 years of probation and I'll be required to register as a sex offender for 10 years.

Take your symptoms seriously, folks. I got into trouble because I kept rationalizing mine, and I didn't have the self-awareness or impulse control to stop myself from doing something monumentally stupid. I completely torpedoed my life, and that of my family. Because of this my wife is going to have to somehow cope with being a single parent. I have no idea if I'm going to be able to provide for them on the other side as a RSO with a criminal record. The future is more uncertain than ever. The good news, at least, is that my marriage is somehow intact. We've been working through things with a counselor to good effect, and in some ways we're stronger than ever. 

Anyway, I don't have much of a point to this except that I wanted to tell my story and remind people not to minimize things when you're having symptoms. It can get you into a world of hurt.",bipolar_disorder

Ups and downs, mania and depression, mood swings throughout the day sometimes. Bipolar tingz. But even though I know I value my family over everything, my actions donâ€™t make it look that way. I also have non verbal learning disorder and ADD, but I learned to â€œact normalâ€ over the years ig. Either way tho, I always have time for and rarely get mad at my friends. If I have a paranoid thought about them sending subliminal shots (I have that a lot ngl) I usually try and see what they mean by it before reacting. But my family gets the ugly side of it. I can be very nice to my fam but I also can be more dismissive, say nasty shit, be less grateful, and jump down their throat when I feel insulted. I wanna know if any other bipolar ppl have the same issue and have tips to work on it bc my fam doesnâ€™t deserve to get the worst of me",bipolar_disorder
"Hi everyone. I know we need meds and they are a saviour. I felt like that when I started Latuda 1.5 years agoâ€¦ I stopped taking my meds cold turkey about 4 weeks ago. I was on the highest dose and I couldnâ€™t take the weight gain and feeling of grey and no sex drive anymore.. I have been researching natural ways to help bipolar but now I feel like I am in a mixed episode. I want to go back on meds but I feel ashamed and guilty for going off and am scared of what my doctor will say/do. I had a thought that I could manage without meds but I am feeling like that was a bad choice I made.. idk. 

Sometimes I feel like do I even have bipolar ? Does anyone else do this or feel like this ? How did you get back on track and stable ?

"Genuinely canâ€™t do this anymore

I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 a couple years ago and only experienced hypomania a few times. Last week I had a full blown Manic episode complete with severe anxiety and psychotic symptoms at the end. Now, I am in probably the worst depressive episode in my life. My gpa dropped so Iâ€™m on an academic hold for fall semester, Iâ€™ve been late to work three times in a row this week and all my coworkers seem to hate me because of it. My boyfriend canâ€™t handle the emotional stress I put on him no matter how many times he says itâ€™s ok. I asked him a couple days ago how heâ€™s doing and he really said that itâ€™s hard to love me. I get that completely, Iâ€™m just too much. Yesterday was my birthday and it was probably the worst birthday Iâ€™ve ever had. It started with me flaking on my brotherâ€™s fishing trip to go to my therapist last minute. It was, at max, a 15min session of her explaining that sheâ€™s unqualified to treat me and referred me to a new facility which means that my med appointment was cancelled as well. Then I went over to my momâ€™s for dinner but it was just filled with family arguments and my dad screaming the whole time. I got home at 10, driving with the most intense intrusive thoughts, while chain smoking the entire hour drive home. I wasnâ€™t able to sleep until midnight then woke up at 3:30 this morning to start my 12 hour shift. Idk what to do. I donâ€™t know how to get through my shift but I canâ€™t just leave and risk getting written up or fired. Drugs donâ€™t help, my â€œsupport systemâ€ is non-existent and I canâ€™t find ways to cope. Pls help this is probably the most mental anguish Iâ€™ve ever felt at once and it is so goddamn overwhelming.",bipolar_disorder

"I think i have been on a manic rampage for past 10 months. Im still on it but i want to sumase this netflix series of my life cause obviously i cant share it with anyone- no one understands what its like. 

It all started when i bought a house last year. I was 30 years old, it was the last thing on my bucket list. 

I started getting bored because i had no other goal at that moment. I then decided to work on me, and got a body builder to train me and i just went spastic with working out 5 times a week. I even said i will compete in a bikini competition lol. 

I look fantastic by the way. 

Then i started getting irritated by my husband. All the things ive been bottling up for years just started to surface again. 

I asked my husband for a divorce in november last year. Tbh i wanted to do that since 2015. I guess it took mania to say how i feel. I got bored of him and his predictivnes. I wanted something more exciting.

I then found myself a lover with whom i have instantly indulged in wild sex. Several times per day. 

I proceded to tell my husband i have had /am having an affair. In hopes he gives me the divorce i wanted. At this point he started also losing his mind.

My lover was in another town where i travel sometimes to work. If i was there and my lover wouldnt have time for me, i would go wild and delusional, causing drama. And obviously i dont want to be the dramatic gorlfriend, So i got a chance once to have sex with someone else i worked with and so i thought â€œ thats great, cause i wont bother the first one so much when im in need of attentionâ€ 

That was ok combination at first. Alltho im totaly in love with my first lover. But i had no guilt cheating on him too because i litteraly just need sex so i cant compute it as cheating yet. Also we are not like officialy together , and im too crazy to commit, and i still havent divorced.

Anywayâ€¦ once you break the moral seal it all goes downhill. It wasnt long after i went to another city to work for a week. I managed to have sex with two other men (not same time) there is absolutley no need for flirting i was super straight forward. One of them was fat. I kind of grew to like giving pitty fucks. It just hypes me up like nothing haha.
And at this point i became extremly addicted to reckless behaviour and sex. 

I then decided i want to be a singer so i paid a stufio to produce the album for me (i finished it btw) i would have crazy insomnia nights just making music. It has taken over me. I was still indulging in sex with both first mentioned men. 

The whole time im posting really seductive and erotic stories on close friends for my other potential victims. I now have a list of 10 whom i have not spoiled yet. They are all over the place. I have them spread like seeds. Im sexting, sending photos and videos, drunk texting - its fucking horrid.

At this point im delusional (i have moments of reality)  that i am some sort of MUSE for these men that im seeing and fucking. Or that i plan too.I tend to have a different personality with each of them. I mirror them and i tell them exactly what they want to hear and i act as they want me to act and when it comes to sex im litterally their own personal porn star. They can do what they want. They have become addicted to me as much as i have become addicted to sex with them. But i am also in love with one of them. Like full blown love (i think, but who knows whilist im in this manic episode) 

However a few nights ago my soon to be ex and i went to a dinner with friends and ended up in the club. Everyone was horrificly pissed and so i went on my hunt. A few men aproached me bit i got my eye stuck on a harry potter looking dude. I then proceeded to cause havoc and drama to my ex so that i could dramatically leave. I tell harry potter to fuck me in his car, he sais he lives across the road, he takes me home, fucks me three times, and i come back to the club after an hour pretending nothing happened ðŸ¤£


I have moments where i question my reality and the life im living and this constant need for validation. The fact that i just went crazy with this devil vagina magic. I have been on paroxetine based medication but it only makes me more angry and crazy cause i cant orgasm and its like living hell. So i stopped taking them. 

Actually the looks on their faces make me want to do even more stupid shit. Im litteraly depending on that dopamine to hit me. Im scared that if i dont allow myself to do this shit im going to start looking for a high somewhere elae and i dont want to go to those dark places. 

I kind of need this Muse to Fuse her fucking pussy and stop this imoral spreading. 

Im scared of what else this year will bring. At this rate i might even fuck santa and his mrs this christmas.",bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™m wondering if any of you have experienced something similar while getting diagnosed with BP? Feel free to share some of your experiences!

Iâ€™ve been battling mental health issues (recovered from ED, then social anxiety and depression) since my early teens. Especially depressive episodes have been a big part of my life but I never talked to a mental health specialist until it got really bad around the age of 17/18. I found a psychotherapist I really vibed with and I was primarily diagnosed with a major depressive episode and social anxiety. PTSD was added on the list later after a few traumatic incidents. 

I made major progress in therapy (especially in regard to my social anxiety) but still struggled with depressive episodes so my psychiatrist prescribed me SSRIs. They helped me at first but then I noticed weird feelings and changes in behaviour that were definitely hypomanic episodes. Iâ€™ve heard from other BP people that this has happened to them as well.

I brought this up with my mental health team over a period of time and my psych said that Iâ€™m likely to suffer from BP2. I researched a lot about it and it made a lot of sense. Unfortunately my therapy ended when I turned 21 (due to insurance things) and Iâ€™m currently looking to get another psych evaluation.",bipolar_disorder

"hellooooo 

so, i'm currently on a weight loss journey! doing the method of CICO + intermittent fasting (OMAD,) it seems to be working for me so far. 

however, my psych wants to up my anti-psychotic, quetiapine, from 300mg to 600mg. i'm freaking out! 

i've read so much on reddit about folks being unable to lose weight on quetiapine. all they do is gain, and gain, and gain. i'm assuming this is because quetiapine slows down metabolism + makes people super hungry all the time. 

see the thing is, i have pretty good willpower at the moment. i'm strict with my diet. i've been eating healthy, walking a lot, counting my calories etc. etc. i've been *hungry* and yet haven't given in to cravings. but is there any point in doing all of this if i'm just going to gain weight regardless? 

i'm debating on whether to up my dosage to 600mg and see how it goes or to just leave it at 300mg, which is my present dosage. 

what is your experience with quetiapine/anti-psychotic weight gain? have you been able to lose weight with a calorie deficit, or is there no hope? lol

I donâ€™t want to â€œjustâ€ take it before I feel I need it due to possible dependency issues and the potential weight gain.

Me too, but i dont like it at all because for me it just looks strange and uncomfortable and I dont feel good at all during this episode.

During the episode it seems like it goes to magnified to normal. Sometimes everything looks distorted and kinda creepy and then it goes back to normal somehow after a while.

The issue I face is that the meds work so well I find myself having a very hard time breaking free from the cycles that contributes to hypo-mania.

In the first months I contacted my doctor and told her that I still needed help. She told me that since I have some extensive childhood trauma, she thinks that may be what's causing my symptoms. I said okay, sooo... Then what's next? Trauma therapy? And.... They said no.

Now I'm in a hypomanic episode again and I feel like I'm loosing it. I feel like I won't survive the next five years if I wont get any fucking help. I feel like I'm on fire, and my whole world too.

We don't need a cart,"" but he instead grabbed a cart, and my mind was ready to write the action off as one of the worst slights I've ever experienced. He might as well have slapped me in the face and cursed me out. My mind was thinking ""rude, rude, rude; he's an awful person,"" and I had trouble shifting my attitude toward him after that for a good few minutes.   


The conclusion my mind drew makes no sense given what I really know about my dad, because one, he's hard or hearing, two, he's probably neurodivergent and doesn't read emotional information like people who are off of the spectrum do, and three, I've known him all of my life and he definitely isn't a bad person, so why was my mind ready to write him off as the *worst person ever* because of this innocent misstep that wasn't *really* a misstep?

I'm sure I was upset about something else, but like I said, I don't usually perceive small bits of emotional information like these. Normally, my dad grabbing a cart when I asked him not to wouldn't bother me and I probably wouldn't even perceive it as ""wrong"" or out-of-place, but lately I've been overly concerned with my thoughts. My emotional mind has been trying to automatically read social situations and draw conclusions from them before my logical mind can catch up, and I've never experienced this before. 

Usually, my emotional mind is silent, and my logical mind is in control, so much so that for a long time, I thought I was probably autistic like my dad. I even got a provisional diagnosis of autism while I was in college. Being able to read emotional information from a social situation bothers me immensely. I feel like it's a challenge to my identity as an autistic person, because most autistic people I know don't care about emotional information as long as you stay away from certain triggers.  I feel like I'm going crazy.",bipolar_disorder

I was actually doing really well for many months. Sure, I had my bad moments but it was manageable thanks to methods Iâ€™ve learned in therapy, working out and journaling.

"I have a professor that was being difficult in complying with my college disability accommodations for my bipolar (and ADHD) and we had an email thread going back and forth about this. The class is via zoom. She apparently had my email thread pulled up before class because as she started screen sharing she had my email thread detailing my disabilities and me explaining all sorts of private details about it, pulled up for the entire class to read on their computers via zoom because she was screen sharing. She was doing something else so she didnâ€™t notice for a moment and then she couldnâ€™t figure out how to switch her screen off of that so the email was pulled up for like 3 minutes, giving the whole class more than enough time to read it. The subject of the email was my first and last name and it was in all the emails. Also, my first and last name shows up with my face on the zoom page too. So everyone could clearly connect that email to me. So it 100% outed my disability to me. I understand mistakes happen but if your whole job is sharing your screen to a zoom class then you shouldnâ€™t have that kind of email pulled up. 

This was yesterday morning and I havenâ€™t gotten any apology or anything from her despite dozens of other class related emails. This is after a week of her being really insensitive and annoying about my accommodations, so I reached out to my disability advisor and she helped me switch professors. But my advisor wants me to take this up the pipeline to the dean. Iâ€™m really nervous about that. This is my first semester, and first class in my major. So it makes me nervous to piss off someone in the department Iâ€™m going to be a part of for the upcoming years. Is it worth risking her retaliating somehow to get her in trouble? My disability advisor thinks so but Iâ€™m always one to stay quiet and play things safe so Iâ€™m really not wanting to. But my advisor says itâ€™s the right thing to do because if she treats me like shit sheâ€™s probably treating other disabled people like shit.",bipolar_disorder

But i am also excited for it due to me getting medication that i wanted because i have really bad anxiety

iâ€™ve struggled with mental health most of my life, and it got particularly bad in the last year with resistance to SSRIs/SNRIs. i had a suspicion it may be BD2, so my provider started me on lamictal as last resort. itâ€™s working more than anything else has ever -

with that being said, iâ€™m super nervous about allowing an official BD2 diagnosis on my med records. the biggest thing I worry about is the condition being a disqualification / barrier for (hopefully) eventual emigration to another country.

"TW: alcohol, mania, rehab, mentions of Hurricane Katrina

Hi, I'm 20F and was diagnosed in this past year with bipolar. 

There is a great-aunt in my family, with whom I've been much closer emotionally and intellectually than the rest of my family - she seems to despise them to some extent, but she and I have always been close. 


The TL;DR is that I can't talk to my family about mental health at all, and want my great-aunt to know that she isn't the only one in the family currently suffering with bipolar.

An episode in the last few months caused my great-aunt to relapse into heavy drinking. She rage-texted my entire family with fiery threats, lashed out at her daughter, and spit accusations of my mother and grandfather being narcissistic parents (she isn't entirely wrong there, though), etc. 

The episode landed her in rehab, cost her her beloved dog, and more recently, daily outpatient therapy. It severely wounded her relationship with my mom, aunt, and grandfather - all of whom are emotionally and geographically a bit too close and share some deep, codependent, post-Hurricane Katrina trauma bonds. 

My great-aunt has been intensely, manically spiritual in the past (like me), is often sleepless and spends her manic energy on reading and the paranormal, has impulse tattoos that she believes came from spiritual messages (like I have), and is known to have a very short temper and has always just been, well, clearly bipolar herself. The last conversation she and I had before her hospitalization was just about a delicious Nigerian dish we both like, and then she dropped off the face of the earth.

I want her to return to a semblance of health, and then I want to one day reach out to her again, once she's home and somewhat stable, and just talk the way we used to about books, cooking, history, etc. 

Is that even possible anymore? I miss her, and I miss having someone in my family who understands my condition. I just want her to know she isn't alone, and that I understand her when our family doesn't.


Context: 

The rest of my family is very, *very* hush-hush about mental health and doesn't want to believe we have anything ""wrong"" with us, i.e., my mom consistently blames my absent, horrendously abusive father's side for my mental illnesses while maintaining that my father somehow in tandem has ""all his faculties in order."" It doesn't help that there is suspicion that my paternal grandmother had bipolar.",bipolar_disorder
"Idk where else to post this but I need to talk about it because this is what we face after diagnosis. So this was a response to me asking for my sons therapist information. I have been totally stable for four years after a bipolar diagnosis in 2018.. I am working in management, nice four bed three bath home, brand new car. Totally happy and stable. Kiddos spoiled beyond belief and make straight Aâ€™s. Amazing kids. He is using this after he up and moved out of the 50 miles radius agreed upon in our parenting plan and breaking several other rules in the contract and now that Iâ€™ve obtained a lawyer for these matters Iâ€™m suddenly unstable and a danger? Btw I have NEVER been a danger to my children so heâ€™s totally grasping for straws here. We are going through a custody battle and his lawyer requests a psych evaluation totally out of the blue which the judge has yet to even approve nor does it say anything about medical decision making. Will the judge look poorly upon this text? Iâ€™m sorry to anyone who has experienced this hatred after a diagnosis. 

In regards to yesterdayâ€¦.

Since you asked what the therapist said, I told you exactly what he said. Sorry if you donâ€™t like it but heâ€™s the expert here, not you, just in case you forgot. If you donâ€™t like what he is doing to try to help then you donâ€™t have to be involved. Respectfully, stay out of it if youâ€™re going to hurt the situation more than help it. You have a psychological evaluation to complete, get it done and then maybe you can help make medical decisions about our son. Until then, you are a potential danger to his health and safety. Iâ€™m sure you read the paperwork. Making medical decisions for him is not allowed until your psychological evaluation is completed with a report reviewed by a judge saying that you are stable enough to make these decisions. In the meantime, if there is a medical emergency with Him, call 911 and contact me.

I was assured it was the same brand but different manufacturer so went ahead with it. Mood started changing. Started feeling like my emotional spectrum multiplied itself but I couldnâ€™t participate in reality enough to express anything. A week later, I got the rashes. Horrible hives all over my back and large, perfectly symmetrical purple splotches on my arm (and there was literally nothing new in my routine that could be the cause other than meds). Contacted my care team who all assured me it didnâ€™t seem dire (not servers allergy or SJ syndrome) as I had no fever and the patterns of rash were too different but suggested I reduce the dose. Dermatologist said heâ€™s never seen something like my skin reaction in his whole life, said it looked it age spots but Iâ€™m 23. Cut the dose in half, and the rash went half away. Due to my pharmacy being a nightmare, and not trusting my raw brain enough to just stop the meds, I had to continue this regimen for the next month. I couldnâ€™t cry at all but wanted to cry all the time , felt so anxious 24/7 that my bones felt like they were vibrating and I couldnâ€™t eat or sleep, and my irritability was out the window. Having thoughts and physical feelings Iâ€™ve never had before and feeling on the verge of psychosis and questioning my entire reality.

Finally got my old brand back, and after taking it for one day I feel like Iâ€™m unclogging a bunch of emotions and had to take the day off work because I canâ€™t stop crying and feeling everything from the past two months.

He has been depressed for a really long time and has been struggling with is mental health for as long as he can remember. He is diagnosed with adhd, dysthymic disorder, anxiety and has experienced panick attacks throughout his life. For the past months he has been really depressed and barely gets out of bed. Sometimes he just lays in bed for hours on end doing absolutely nothing. That being said he has been acting really different for the past 2/3 days. I was gone all day before yesterday so didnâ€™t really notice anything different but since yesterday he has been obsessed with me. Iâ€™ve been feeling really down myself and havenâ€™t exactly been acting that close with him. I am constantly irritated and a lot of times make him feel worse by acting harsh and cursing at him (This is because we have a difficult history with each other) so that isnâ€™t really a rational reason to get obsessed with me all of the sudden. Right now he even says so himself that I feel like a god to him right now. I am flawless and perfect. He canâ€™t concentrate on anything cause I am the center of his world right now. He is convinced that I am gonna be the mother of his child and he has a picture of me in front of him all day. He doesnâ€™t do anything besides telling me how perfect I am and just constantly being obsessed with me. He feels like he is invincible and is overly optimistic even tho our situation and his is really difficult. Iâ€™ve known him for 3/4 years now and he has never acted like this.

"It usually doesnt bother me when it comes to random strangers talking shit about my bipolar, (but i care when they say shit to other people because i know how much more it can affect someone). Itâ€™s different with a doctor for me.

Anyway, I went to see a new neurologist and if i say I have bipolar they immediately treat me differently. 

Told him im on 400mg of lamictal, 50 mg of seroquel as needed and 300mg lamictal. I hate it but its what works for me. He asked what for and I understand why he asked so I shouldny have gone â€œi dont need to tell youâ€ but it was that immediate fear I wouldnt be taken seriously.

Now this is the part : He straight up laughed (hard) and went â€œThats a HUGE dosage, and i bet you wont have kids because of the bipolarâ€ and went on to explain to ME how bipolar works. Now, I dont want kids but it still really hurt me that someone could say that, a doctor at that. I ended up spiraling, crying, depressed and then angry. Imagine I did want kids? He ended up just saying i dont need migraine medicine or an mri (to check for potential growths in my brain) and ended the call. 

I havent seen a neurologist since and my heart pounds even harder when I list my medications.

"Prior to the pandemic, I had paid off all my credit card debt ($12,000+) and was working toward saving money.   I'm an independent contractor, and as bipolar 1 the pandemic hit me particularly hard.  

I lost several of the contracts I had, which forced me to run my credit cards back up and blow my savings for rent and bills.  Pretty soon they were all maxed out again and was scraping month-to-month just to pay rent.  I went into extreme isolation which pushed me back into risky behaviors I had let go of.  

Eventually had to start asking my family for help to cover bills, and last month at 37, I had to swallow my pride and move back in with my parents as I attempted to stabilize my income.  Then, I wake up this morning to alerts that Chase had closed my three personal credit cards as well as my business card.  They were all maxed out anyway, but I was hoping that I'd eventually be able to pay them off to boost my credit score after it got totally wrecked.

"(NSFW because it's pretty gross.)

This may not sound bad on paper, but combining it with having difficulty brushing my teeth, then yeah it's pretty bad. I believe it was at the beginning of last year that I really took this unhealthy habit as a coping mechanism. 

At first, it was just one soda every few days or a week or two. Eventually, it led to a 2-liter soda every day. I am addicted, horribly so. And the thing is, I try to tell myself that getting rid of a soda addiction will be easy, but for some reason, the rest of my brain just doesn't want to listen!

I used to have very nice teeth.

They're ruined now. 

Chunks have fallen off on some of my molars and I have nasty cavities. 

I have to be careful while eating. I can't eat too far right or there will be pain and I can't eat too far left or there will be a pain. 

I hate myself for letting myself go down this spiral. Maybe, just maybe if I got help sooner then this would be way less bad than it is. Maybe just maybe if my mom stopped trying to blame my mental illness on everything under the sun (the seasons, weather, moon phases, etc.) besides, y'know, MENTAL ILLNESS, then my teeth will be better.

Some good news is that for the past two months I have been trying my best to brush my teeth when I NEED to. Which are three times a day. Unfortunately, I still have those times many days when I just can't convince myself to do it. 

The moral of the story is to brush your teeth, even if you don't want to, just do it. Don't end up like me with nasty-looking and painful teeth. I just had to swish toothache reliever in my mouth for about five minutes.

"Hi /r/bipolar.

This isnâ€™t asking to be diagnosed, first and foremost. Iâ€™m kinda afraid to actually see someone about this.

Lemme just give some background info real quick. Best friends with another girl since 14. We fall in love, start dating at 18, get married at 22, and weâ€™re together for 11 years. I thought Iâ€™d spend my life with her.

I started to struggle with anxiety progressively and became increasingly agoraphobic. Tried therapy and eventually tried Lexapro after years of therapy didnâ€™t help.

A few weeks after starting Lexapro I started getting overconfident and disassociated. I donâ€™t remember a lot from those four months, but I insisted that I wanted an open relationship, ended up moving in with a girl from a dating app after a week, left my job, and became really unhinged. I lost track of my meds and reality kinda hit me.

I went home and it was too late. My heart shattered and Iâ€™ve been kinda trying not to think about it for some months as I re-establish my life. I, along with everyone else, thought it was a mental breakdown.

In the chaos I didnâ€™t really think of the meds but lately I started doing research and it kinda sounds like I got super manic, but this lasted four months. Is this a bipolar thing? Should I be concerned about this? Has anyone else had SSRIs trigger these things?

Like, when Iâ€™m â€œasleepâ€, I feel unaware that I exist, and then I â€œwakeâ€ and I remember I exist and I remember what it is to be human, and I fear to lose this awareness because I know I will and inherently I will not be aware that Iâ€™ve lost it and that scares me.

Itâ€™s almost like Iâ€™ve reached a level of awareness so high that Iâ€™ve awoken from a dream, but I wonâ€™t know when I am dreaming again. Until Iâ€™ve awoken again. And I fear being unaware that I am unaware.

"Due to not having a psych provider for most of this year I had to fight to get refills of meds I've been on from 11-4 years.

Urgent care visits, emergency refills, begging 1 Pcp (and then her replacement) for refills etc.

I only managed to get set up with a new provider because my current Pcp sent multiple referrals and hounded each office until I was able to get in.

There's a shortage of psych providers in my area and even more so with my insurance.

I consistently managed to get my lithium and lamictal refills but the fucking oxcarbamazapine has been giving me trouble for months.

I was on 600mg at night and 300 in the morning (until a month ago when I asked my new provider to lower it down to 300mg bid for several reasons).

I was constantly running out of or not having enough of one so I would have to break the 600 in half so I would have at least 300 each dose or taking 2 300 tablets to compensate for not having the 600 and having to pay out of pocket because my insurance deemed things too soon to refill.

I have completely gone through withdrawals 3 times this year and none of them have been my fault. 

I'm currently going through them again right now because my uterus decided to act like it was committing bloody fucking murder. My pharmacy is way across town and it's an HR both ways on public transit. 

Apparently 2 days without it is enough to have shocks going throughout my body. (Super not helpful as there's a spider infestation and it keeps feeling like bugs/arachnids touching me).

It's been such a pain in the ass to maintain and get and I am so frustrated as I haven't had anywhere near the problems with my other meds.

It was added to deal with a depressive episode like 4 years ago and I've stayed on it as historically with me if things are fine, it helps and doesn't cause problems then I stay on it.

The past few times that I felt like the universe was telling me something it was legit and my life improved when I listened. (Tubal ligation, leaving someone, transferring to another store location).

I've been doing the generally being stable and staying in treatment thing for over a decade so I'm not being stupid nor are there grandeur issues.

I just feel like oxcarbamazapine has become far more trouble than it feels like it's worth.

"I started a new job about 5 months ago. Itâ€™s been going okay, for the most part, the benefits are good, the people are nice.
But lately Iâ€™ve been stressed and been acting out of control.
I think I might have figured out what hypomania is and I am experiencing it. 
I have bought hundreds of dollars of shoes, I went on a random solo trip, I have felt disconnected, been drinking and smoking, not sleeping well, slightly hyper. The worst part is Iâ€™m starting to get paranoid and have slightly delusional thoughts that I know are weird but in the moment I get angry. I think my coworker hates me or Iâ€™m going to get fired. I have convinced myself that Iâ€™m in love with another coworker (itâ€™s more like ocd).

"Iâ€™m not even manic (i think?), Iâ€™m incredibly depressed and s****dal. Itâ€™s 7am and Iâ€™m still not asleep. Yesterday I had to force myself to finally fall asleep at noon and then had to wake up an hour later. Itâ€™s impossible these days for me to fall asleep before 5am, and itâ€™s only getting later as the days go by. I did have a very good day today, which was strange. My therapist thinks Iâ€™m delusional but thatâ€™s common when Iâ€™m depressed. It does feel kinda good being up like this, but itâ€™s not like I have energy, itâ€™s just pure insomnia. Still objects are moving too. I think this is all from dropping acid at midnight a couple weeks ago, but Iâ€™d assume my sleep would be back to normal by now. Shit just kinda sucks.

But why do I feel so hurt, crummy and jealous?  Am I just a terrible person?  Is this a bipolar thing?  I always feel like an outsider.   Always have, probably always will at this point.

"Maybe it's anxiety idk I've worked on dealing with stress to control my moods having a baby hasn't helped and I've dealt with alot of depression since their birth. I just can't help feel that I'm always one bad day away from everything falling apart everyday I'm just agitated and irritable. 

I've had a hard time dealing with our baby he's our second and I never wanted another kid my wife finally convinced me after 9 years to have another one. I care about him and do everything I can to make sure he's taken care of I just don't enjoy having a baby.

I try my best to make sure I don't do anything impulsive I don't drink, I don't own firearms, but I constantly feel like I'm one stressful day away losing control getting wasted and doing something dumb and I don't know how to fix that feeling.

My psych tells me I have to find hobbies, but I really don't even enjoy things anymore. When I try doing something my mind focuses on other things so I don't really enjoy the moment. I use to game, but that was years ago and with a baby I don't have a lot of time for that anymore.

My new psych said that she thinks lamotrigine and prozac will work better for me. Itâ€™s more of an old fashioned way to treat bipolar disorder, she says. Iâ€™m afraid that going off the antipsychotic will make me more, well, psychotic. Maybe I shouldnâ€™t take it in a literal sense? Right now I am on all three medications and it is working well but I am gaining so much weight and constantly hungry. I really want to go off Latuda but Iâ€™m scared.",bipolar_disorder
"I've been diagnosed with Bipolar II twice in my life. I've also been diagnosed with BPD, GAD, ODD, and PTSD. My psychiatrist uses the term ""Bipolar spectrum"" when discussing my diagnoses, so I don't think she's even sure of what's going on. I've been trying to get a psych eval for over a year, but insurance keeps denying it.

Does it even matter? Do I need to know? As much as I want to know, I don't think it matters in the end. My symptoms are the same, the treatment is relatively the same (mood stabilizers, therapy to manage anxiety and depression, using DBT in my daily life), the way people treat me will be the same. Yet at the same time, getting the PTSD diagnosis changed my life! Being treated for PTSD helped me immensely, and I wouldn't have gotten through the worst time in my life without it.

"Life is weird. I had depression and anxiety for years, and finally after finding a new psychiatrist almost two years ago, she said it was BPD type 2. I asked her how she got to that diagnosis, and she said that me having taken 7-8+ medicines and not experiencing much improvement was the tip off, and how it can take a long time to get a diagnosis. Iâ€™ve been on a mood stabilizer for almost two years and it has really made a difference. 

But I seem to experience the deprsssion a lot more. I donâ€™t know, I feel like I say â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€ a lot, and I recognize thatâ€™s just part of adulting and being human. But one glass of red wine a night keeps me sane. Even when I build a strong foundation of financial stability, fitness and exercise, socializing, I still feel sad. Not to the point of being at rock bottom, but I think this is just my normal. And considering how bad I was years ago, this is still a major improvement. 

I guess Iâ€™m just trying to figure out my brain. Itâ€™s weird, and I like spending my weekends alone with my dog, but j also feel like Iâ€™m failing as a person, because people I. Their early 30s like me should be out doing things, but all the things I like to do are solitary.

I went away for a bachelorette party this weekend. We stayed up extremely late on Friday, had some drinks, and I missed my dose of my mood stabilizer. I got about 4 hours of sleep. I was exhausted all day and now here I am approaching 24 hours (19 currently, feeling wide awake, and head home in 3 hours) of no sleep and I'm worried that one day will turn into four again.

"Something I was just thinking about in the shower: to me, art (made by someone extremely dedicated to their craft) is so much more powerful when it comes from someone with bipolar disorder. Even before my diagnosis, I connected so much more to the art and music made by those suffering from this condition. As an artist (musician) myself, there is no greater feeling than working on a new song during a manic episode and being convinced that it is the greatest piece of audio ever created. I'd assume there's a similar grandiose feeling experienced by successful artists, Ye is one that comes to mind, that insist their work is divine. To me, it feels that my songs and art come from supernatural places and that I am somehow graced with a gift from higher entities. Obviously, this does me no favors regarding humility, but my art is my obsession; it's the one thing I truly put my heart and soul into and will stop at nothing (I stop at depression but you get the jist) to craft a piece of work that I view as truly great. Plus, I have lower than low views of myself in every other aspect.  After this shower, I have a newfound urge to support bipolar artists more than ever. People like whatever art they like of course, but in my opinion, when a bipolar artist says their work is great, you'd better fucking believe them. Even if it actually sucks, I believe their art is coming from a different place than most, one more sincere and filled with unrelenting passion. And as we all know, we live in realities a bit different from most people sometimes, but I think that our own realities are valid, and if a manic artist thinks they're the shit, I'm not gonna argue with them! Anyway, just thought I'd share this with just about the only community I relate to in some way. Hope y'all are well and safe! :)

I was diagnosed way back in '09 or '11, and I'm doing well! But I am curious.. because there are illnesses are could theoretically be cured one day, such as cancer, I think.

Iâ€™ve been told consistently that I have ADHD by multiple friends and relatives. However my psychiatrist says it could just be me in mania and a bipolar issue. 


Even then, Iâ€™m not exactly sure what qualifies as just ADHD and what qualifies as just bipolar since Iâ€™ve noticed that both somewhat intertwine one way or another, so Iâ€™m not too sure how to bring it up to my psychiatrist because I really would like to go back to college and would like to go back to learning how to do things but I just have no motivation at all and Iâ€™ve noticed that it is pretty persistent especially with work and staring at a computer despite having multiple breaks and being given outlets like listening to music and so forth",bipolar_disorder

I just need to talk into the void. I canâ€™t tell if im hypomanic or not I had like a peak a few days ago after a ptsd episode yah know what I mean the flick of the switch. The day after that too. But now im fine so im just on the I donâ€™t have bipolar train rn bc my doctors refuse to diagnose with a type of bipolar so itâ€™s like is it just something else at this point like u canâ€™t pin point it or something I donâ€™t think itâ€™s that hard to tell the difference between one and two like im not a fucking doctor and I understand the difference. I think itâ€™s bpd bc my psych said I have it but he wonâ€™t diagnose me bc then ppl wonâ€™t take the bipolar seriously but I just donâ€™t even think I have bipolar anymore and I just think itâ€™s bpd bc when im â€œmanicâ€ I hyperfixate on ppl and relationships with me and sex and shit like that. I donâ€™t even know if I qualify like hypomania has to last four days right but how tf do I know if im hypomanic I only know if there is a flick of a switch if thereâ€™s no flick I donâ€™t think im manic. Like I had a flip of switch two days ago but im perfectly fine no. I got my meds upped but I havenâ€™t taken the higher dose yet bc I got them today. The np was saying she was scared to put me up bc im on lamictal and skin diease and I was like well im under medicated bc my doctor thought I was doing fine but I actually wasnâ€™t and we planned on going to 200mg but we didnâ€™t. And now im stressed about the skin diseases which is rare and if u dose it properly it wonâ€™t but like omg now im scared of that and donâ€™t want to take my meds but if I donâ€™t take them then I will get the skin disorder. .0. Idk what to do I donâ€™t think im manic but now that im typing this out im like hm mayb? But im talking and acting perfectly fine. Irl so I donâ€™t really think this wall of text means anything. Anyways conclusion I donâ€™t think im bipolar and itâ€™s just bpd. Ik what the trigger is and I canâ€™t get rid of it bc itâ€™s out of my control the trigger is seeing the person that sexually assaulted me in all of my classes everyday living their best life while I have extreme ptsd and life isnâ€™t fare I didnâ€™t do anything wrong and now I punished. This is why I donâ€™t believe in god bc how could a being let their creations suffer this way. Like I donâ€™t deserve that I deserve to be able to function in school and my school counselor is like well how do we do that and I said the only thing that would fix that is if this person gets kicked out of the school bc there are only 8 ppl in my major. But it wonâ€™t happen. Iâ€™m talented and smart and this guy is udder shit trash untalented and only got in bc they went to a reputable highschool. Like their art is so shit Iâ€™m so much better than them everyone says so everyone wants them kicked out of the program bc Iâ€™m literally the best student in my major and Iâ€™m more essential and beneficial to the school bc I have all As I turn in my work in time and i donâ€™t fucking sexually assault ppl. Iâ€™m going to get them kicked out Iâ€™m going to fight the system Iâ€™m going to win this fucking case and everyone can suck my ass. I can win against them even if they have a lawyer bc they have nothing supporting them. I literally had to be sent to crisis counseling bc I almost went into shock bc of a ptsd episode. If that doesnâ€™t show how itâ€™s impacting my work I donâ€™t know what is. Iâ€™m so much more important than them in so many ways.

"PSA Please Take Your Meds!!!

But if you think about it, our brains aren't defective. We're called disordered, crazy or psychotic forced to live in a society that is completely ludicrous.

We put our young in classrooms and force them to learn and behave in ways that are completely unnatural to their psyche. We give them medicine because their senses are overloaded designed to encapture all the sights smells and sounds of nature. But we dull those into the mundane structure of a sterile classroom and repeat numbers systems and problems that have no applicable merit to their instincts.

We grow to strive for a job that goes against everything our wiring is programmed to do. Stuffing ourselves in a monotonous 9-5 drugging for 30-40 years so we can have some security in the hope for a few restful years of reprieve before our inevitable death.

We're wired to be free, to conquer survive and mesh with nature. Our mania has hypervigilant senses and energy that would make us envious and successful in a tribe. Hunting, building, adapting and foraging in the summer. Our depression would give us rest and reprieve to hibernate in the winter, rinse and repeat.

We're disordered in a society that disorders our and all humans natural senses, emotions, thoughts and instincts. We are meant to live in these boxes, systems and structures. We spend our lives measuring success and telling ourselves otherwise. When we can't adapt we allow others to tell us we're defect, weak or sick and take medicine to adapt to something that's never been adaptive to us.

Therapy is really at the end of the day finding ways to cope and process, a process we were never meant to live.

I enjoy the stability therapy and medicine give me. I have to live in this structure of modern society. I want the happiness and success others find in it. But remember you're not broken or insane for your brain telling you things aren't right. The world we live in isn't right for us, so we have to find all the little ways we can to make it so.

Just wanted to give everyone a perspective that most won't tell or ever know. You're wired to be the absolute best at natural survival. It's the world that has wired itself unnaturally.

Before you all tell me to speak to my psychiatrist, I am already seeing him soon. My psychiatrist increased my dose of seroquel xr by 150mg 2 weeks ago. So that means Iâ€™m on a combined total of 400mg (including my Immediate release), but Iâ€™ve noticed really weird side effects on this new dose and Iâ€™m not sure if anyone can relate: 

- firstly, Iâ€™m not sleeping, or Iâ€™m sleeping early hours of the morning 
- nightmares, making me wake up from my sleep 
- hearing really high pitched sounds 
- hypersexual, constantly aroused even in really inappropriate situations 
- elevated mood some days, and some days extremely depressed and crying 
- suppressed appetite 
- waking up from a  concert/rave going on inside my head 
- when I close my eyes at night I see patterns, or instruments, or say a guitar string vibrating while itâ€™s connecting from ear to ear (inside my head) 
- lots and lots of energy 
- increased concentration, sounds good, but Iâ€™m hyper focused to the point where I lose track of time and forget Iâ€™m human

"I've been diagnosed for years. Went through phases of being medicated, unmedicated, medicated but not taking them regularly enough to be helpful, drug use, sobriety, you name it.

And quite frankly, I'm fucking tired of living with this disorder.

I'm doing EVERYTHING I can to manage this. I'm only 22, however I feel like I've missed out on very important parts of life.

Ironically, I'm left grieving over the new development in my management; Sleep hygeine and Social Rhythms (routine.)

I'm the kind of person who likes to go to bars until the sun comes up, get 2 hours of sleep, then go to work. And so are ALL of my friends. From my understanding, this is just typical for those in my age range. ""Sowing our wild oats"" or something like that.

Ultimately, I know that routine and a balanced circadian rhythm will do wonders for my mental health. At the same time though, it just fucking sucks. I made plans with a friend at 7pm to hang out, and explicitly told him that I needed to be in bed at 10:30. He was driving at the time, and I assumed that he was just going to pick me up on his way home.

And you know what he did? He went home and took a fucking nap. It is now 9:30, when I take my 8 pills every night, and I'm just now hearing back from him.

Part of me wants to tear him a new one. I feel like I've been fucked over. But, I'm working on my anger issues as well. So I just informed him, in the nicest way possible, about why this is so important.

This just isn't fair.",bipolar_disorder

"Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for the past week and I canâ€™t get it out of my head. I live in a very beautiful state that also has a lot of places that are out of the middle of nowhere. Iâ€™m not angry or upset or sad or anything else, in fact I feel incredibly good. I am just tired of life being full of so much pressure and having so many responsibilities and I want to be free and live peacefully. I crave being somewhere beautiful and pleasant and amazing

Iâ€™ve been going for a lot of walks on nature trails and at state parks to try to fulfill this desire and while I love doing that it isnâ€™t enough, I want to stay there forever and never have to return to all of the ugly parts of the world. I want my outside world to be as amazing as I feel inside

Today I met a cat that Iâ€™m pretty sure was actually an angel because he was so friendly and kept following me around and only coming back to me even though we were around so many people. At first I thought I was his guardian but really I think he was mine. He went back to the neighborhood where he came from for awhile and right as I was about to leave he came back again like he knew and wanted to say goodbye to me. I think he was sent to me to tell me the message that I should pursue this and fulfill what Iâ€™m searching for. If youâ€™re happy then you already have everything youâ€™ll ever need, anything else is just materialistic and replaceable

Iâ€™m not really sure why Iâ€™m posting this. I guess Iâ€™m just curious if anyone else has done the same.

"I've always thought there's a kind of a sensitivity associated with my bipolar. I can be affected by things quite strongly. But now I'm wondering if that sensitivity extends to being influenced by marketing. In my childhood I was obsessed with catalogues, and later with things like clothes labels and particular bands or record labels. I see now that I was being attracted by the concept of these things as much as I was by the things themselves. Even, I dunno, not-cool things like shampoo or face wash, I would be taken in by whatever claims were made on the bottle, regardless of the actual experience of using these things. 

I get very uneasy feelings in supermarkets where there seem to be all these products invading my psychological space. It can be overwhelming. I've lived abroad in Asia for many years and I think one of the benefits for me is that advertising doesn't affect me as much as it's not in my first language so I find it easy to tune out.

"I was not formally diagnosed with bipolar although a couple psychiatrists had assessed me for it in their file as  bipolar disorder NOS/unspecified mood disorder. I didn't know this until I recently got ahold of all my medical files. I have been on antidepressants most my life, ,never had a true manic or hypomanic episode before although I cannot be sure as I didn't know the signs. Reckless behaviors can also be attributed to my borderline diagnosis and they were in the past. 

Anyways, the antidepressants prozac triggered a hypomanic or manic episode I'm not sure. Basically i drove my car into a tree and camped out and had to be hospitalized. Then they but me on another one and it got much much worse. I was up for a week straight. Planning to go back to school, actually planning on being a surgeon specifically. I called school after school. I wrote down many things in a journal. I couldn't stop talking. Medication such as benzo would not put me out. They had to up a zdrug to beyond its limit to get me to sleep even for a couple hours. I asked the psychiatrist and he told me ""unspecified mood disorder"" then the pharmacist told me it could be cyclothmia or something similar. Although I have MDD and if I don't take antidepressants I can't get out of bed and this is not an overstatement. 

I have been in some kind of episode now, had a rage and totally blacked out and have amnesia. Then yesterday i was feeling like my psychiatrists have botched my brain and i want to go off my meds. I'm scared and I have no idea what to do????",bipolar_disorder

For background, I am bipolar 2, and my boyfriend and I have been together for 11 months.

I was scrolling through my local subreddit and stumbled across a post that was clearly my boyfriend just judging by the content of the post. I couldnâ€™t help myself and scrolled through some of his comments. 
We are both bisexual. I saw a post about when he came out to me and at the time I said I felt we were still in a straight relationship but I only said that because we are straight passing.

"My pdoc has always been adamant that I don't have ADHD and I have always been adamant that I do. I was diagnosed with it at 16 and they took it away when I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 at 21. It's our one point of contention. I got a second opinion on it by someone who specializes in ADHD and was diagnosed immediately. 

I told him my pdoc thinks my ADHD symptoms are manic symptoms and asked him if he thought I was actually just manic. He said no, I have very obvious signs of ADHD just in the short time it took for him to assess me. He also said the symptoms I came in for and the ones I starred on his diagnosis sheet were all ADHD symptoms out of all the disorder symptoms mixed in there.

So yeah I told my pdoc I was diagnosed with ADHD and I'm on Vyvanse now with my bipolar meds which she has always refused to do for me, and she cancelled my telehealth appointment for the next day and scheduled me in office a week from then which is in a few days. I'm worried about why she did that because we always do telehealth, I'm worried she is really angry or will refuse to continue treating me or something.

"It started a year ago (Iâ€™m 42). I suddenly started getting very physical agitation, crying uncontrollably, having no appetite whatsoever, sleep was gone (I would sleep for maybe 2 hours then wake up, pace and have this horrible energy as if an alien was trying to come out from the inside; it was a horrible pain but I couldnâ€™t localise it; I felt it came from the chest/stomach area and would spread to the brain causing horrendous tension headaches). I was convinced I was dying from some neurological disorder. I was convinced some permanent shift occurred in my brain structurally.

Evenings were usually better. I even sometimes felt almost like myself again and thought this was all just a nightmare. Brain MRI and all blood tests came back normal (there was one white dot but the radiologist didnâ€™t comment on it at all; my friend neurologist pointed it out but said everyone has at least one, depending on age).

I suffered for several months in this state which kept getting worse. My SO eventually found me a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with agitated depression (I was not convinced). Mirtazapine 15mg and Quetiapine 100-150mg made this horrible feeling go away eventually after a few weeks. I could sleep again. I felt so much better. But I always felt like the medication was just suppressing this feeling of agitation but not curing it completely.

Over the last year, I had 3 set backs. First, when I increased Mirtazapine to 30mg, the horrible agitation came back again. My PDR added â€œpossible mixed stateâ€ to my diagnosis as he thought it might have activated me.

Second time was when my psychiatrist wanted to try if I could just stay on Quetiapine and had me wean off Mirtazapine. As soon as I came off, this horrible feeling came back again. But didnâ€™t last long: after I increased Mirtazapine back to 15mg, I felt better again.

And more recently, I have been reducing Quetiapine slowly over a moth or two until 25mg and when I started reducing Mirtazapine; it again came back. It creeps up slowly and then the agitation suddenly hits me. I notice the appetite goes first and sleep (waking up early and feeling very physically anxious). But at the same time I feel also very tired and out of it. Itâ€™s so hard to describe: the whole perception of the world changes. I only feel doom and everything that used to make me happy, makes me cry as I become convinced I am dying very soon. I pace for hours, waiting for the torment to pass.

I find it very hard to believe and accept this is a mental disorder. I feel something shifted in my brain and I canâ€™t seem to return or â€œunshiftâ€ it. I donâ€™t understand why it suddenly happened while before, for 40 years of my life I was completely fine. I had anxieties and stress before but this feels so different. I can use vocabulary to describe it and while it may sound like anxiety and agitation but it is much more than that. The vocabulary doesnâ€™t exist to describe the terror, despair and horror plus all the physical symptoms that come with it. Can it really just be agitated depression or mixed state or whatever?

My thoughts are not fast, my speech is not slurred or pressured but thereâ€™s just this inner horrible agitation I cannot describe (whenever I reduce the meds). 

After increasing back Mirtazapine to 15mg and upping the Quetiapine a little, I feel much better after 4-5 days of this horror. But I am scared that I will never be able to be myself again. I feel so guilty letting everyone and my family down (another reason why I cry). I feel so useless and I canâ€™t get past this permanent shift in my thinking that my days are numbered.

My psychiatrist explained that mood episodes change or get better with time, even without treatment but I feel the meds just suppress whatever it is I have but donâ€™t get rid of it. This â€œthingâ€ is now always there, lurking in the background and it will never go away. I am also scared that I will become tolerant or â€œimmuneâ€ to the meds and they stop working. I donâ€™t know what I would do; but I wouldnâ€™t be able to stay alive in that state. I read Mirtazapine isnâ€™t even a strong or very useful antidepressant but for some reason, it seems to have this pivotal effect on me.

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? Does this even sound like a mental illness? I am having difficulties recognising it as such or making sense of any of it. I just know what when Iâ€™m at my worst, I feel Iâ€™m gone, itâ€™s not me, itâ€™s someone else and I am just following the motions. At my best, I feel Iâ€™m about 70-80% of who I use to be.

"Not sure where to post it but I just want to know if anybody else experience this. Usually happens when Iâ€™m about to wake and it feels very slow and distorted. Like Iâ€™m awake but hallucinating, I move from place to place where I see weird things happen (or happen to me) which I have no control over and then eventually, finally, I wake up. Or rather I open my eyes for a brief second and thatâ€™s when I realize itâ€™s not real. But at this point itâ€™s really hard for me to keep my eyes open or move my body even, so itâ€™s like Iâ€™m stuck in this dream reality and I have to really struggle to bring myself back.

"Iâ€™ve long believed that there must be a deeper purpose to bipolar disorder. We experience a more broad and intense range of emotions and that in and of itself is a gift.

However, mania and depression are unpleasant and a hinderance. The popular literature suggests that these swings are out of our control. I believe that every human has a much greater power than we realize and people with bipolar have the potential to achieve a state of sustained hypomania.

I think most of you will agree that being hypo is a good thing. My conception of hypo is that it is a state of controlled elevation. Mania on the other hand is when this elevation becomes out of control. It takes over and wreaks havoc.

In hypo, I can tap into a powerful flow state. I can feel the energy of the universe pulsing through me. Iâ€™m so present that Iâ€™ve completely broken through the matrix. 

Of course I have not achieved the ability to completely control my states like I describe. Iâ€™ve started on a path of transformation and I can feel myself approaching a more elevated state of self control. I am only just beginning this journey but my habits to get to this realization have been drastic. I implemented a lifestyle overhaul and audited everything I do to only focus on what elevates me.

Sorry if this doesnâ€™t make sense.

But, I am not getting the racing thoughts, inflated ego, irritation and other things I get when manic/hypomanic. I've been very stable on my meds for a while now and overall feel really good. Is it possible that maybe my natural state when my mental health is good is to just be very high energy? Is this something that other bipolar people have experienced?",bipolar_disorder
"I have a history of sexual assault and rape, as well as a history of hypersexuality. I tend to be highly sexual when I'm manic and pretty uninterested in sex otherwise, in part due to my trauma and in part due to meds.
In any case, I decided a while back that I won't have sex unless I'm 100% into it. I've been coerced into sex too many times and it feels dehumanizing to just have sex when I'm not in the mood. That means I don't have sex very often, but when I do, it doesn't leave me feeling like less of a person or traumatized.
I've told two therapists this: a sex therapist and my current regular therapist. Both have said it's unreasonable or extreme to only have sex when I'm 100%. My therapist said I probably won't ever be 100% anyway because of my trauma and anxiety, but I don't think that's true. 
I genuinely can't see if I'm being unreasonable or if my therapists are giving me bad advice. I want to have a healthy sex life but that sometimes feels impossible with Bipolar and PTSD.",bipolar_disorder

"I was talking with my therapist about my bipolarity and what synergizing these opposites would look like. Is there something beyond ""the muddled middle"" which can feel dull, de-vitatlized. But not the frightening disconnected thrall of hypomania. As we talked I realized we were discussing these opposites in purely pathological terms (hypomania / depression or grandiosity/defeat, etc.)

"I am 18 years old and as of about two years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 by two different psychiatrists. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the same for everyone im sure it isnâ€™t but as far as Iâ€™ve been told, bipolar 1 mania is very intense as opposed to the depression part of it. Whereas bipolar 2 depression is worse than the hypomania. So because of this, I didnâ€™t think I was capable of having an intense manic episode. The mania that I usually feel is mild. I just get really confident and energetic, I get very impulsive but only with spending money, I never put myself in dangerous situations, etc. as of a week ago my psychiatrist put me on adderall for my adhd. It started out okay I didnâ€™t really feel any different at first and it wasnâ€™t helping any of my symptoms so I asked her to up my dosage. Thatâ€™s when it started. I was working on a piece for my Halloween costume and I stood in my kitchen for 8 hours straight with no break making it. I thought that was just how normal people focused on projects. Then my parents started to get concerned because I was speaking so fast and incoherent, they literally said it was like I was on crack. I had no idea it was even happening. I felt high. I felt like I wasnâ€™t real. I slept maybe 3 hours in two days. I just thought it was the adderall. I eventually realized when my fiancÃ©, who I live with, told me I was acting a way I have never acted the entire time Iâ€™ve known him, which is almost 4 years. I was trying to keep calm when I realized because I was scared of having a psychotic break. I was scared. It didnâ€™t feel good at all. As of right now itâ€™s the next day and I feel normal again. I obviously am going to stop taking the adderall and Iâ€™m going to stay away from stimulants. But it was just so scary. I even ended up driving to the store in that state because I didnâ€™t know I was having an intense manic episode. I was scared when I realized I couldâ€™ve crashed and hurt myself or others. 

I guess Iâ€™m just worried that, even though Iâ€™ve never felt this before and itâ€™s never been that intense and I believe it was caused by the adderall, Iâ€™m going to have one again. Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s the start of more intense episodes.",bipolar_disorder
"F 24 (bipolar 2).

This was followed by a 2 month depression where I didnâ€™t work out at all and since then Iâ€™ve only been running and doing Pilates 1-2 times a week.

Fast forward to nearly a decade later and my life is entirely different. Between COVID, general maturation, and years of therapy I feel so unrelated to my younger self.

Iâ€™ve talked with my therapist she is in support of trying them out.

I spoke to my acupuncturist and they are going to help me identify any contra indications for the herbal and dietary supplements that I take with a more thorough blood work up.

I plan to start the Lamotrigine (25mg) after I hear back about the interactions.

"I have had some luck in treating hypomania with Risperidone, but my depression only got worse on it. Nothing else has really worked without side effects too severe to continue. (I consider 3 things too severe: relentless nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, psychosis, or sexual dysfunction that goes beyond ED)

In the past, like a decade ago I was on Seroquel:

* caused me excessive rage. (possibly my first mixed episode? I dunno), terrifying sleep paralysis, first bedwetting incidents since I was a teen (now that seems to be back anyway so whatever)...but if it induced mixed borderline-psychotic violent episodes, that's not ""better"".

In the last 2 years (from multiple doctors):

* Amitriptyline - microscopic dose induced severe mania (not hypomania) and complete dissociation. Some chest pains. (took for a couple weeks)
* Lamictal - first dose induced psychosis. (took for 1 day!)
* Risperidone - (WORKED for mania+psychotic symptoms, but *INCREASED DEPRESSION*). Fainting spells, complete inability to feel pleasure of any kind, and orgasm dysfunction, but I stayed on it for 9 months.
* Escitalopram - (WORKED) Instant hypomania that went away in a few days (thanks to risperidone). Took for 6 weeks. Only stopped because it induced violent diarrhea that got worse over time, and was not ""making it"" so I could no longer leave my house. No other side effects. If I remember correctly, I took it while on risperidone to counter the hypomania.
* Duloxetine - (WORKED?) vomiting, every single time I took it. Took it for 1 week. Loved how it helped my mental health, felt bubbly and giggly like a 12 year old schoolgirl, but I was fading into underweight territory and I despise throwing up. It also created/aggravated stomach ulcers.
* Desvenlofaxine (DID NOT WORK) The higher the dose, the more depressed I got! Also caused the most severe sexual problems. No other side effects, but it was useless.
* Trintellix - (DID NOT WORK) nausea all the time. Threw up sometimes. On it 6 weeks - nausea never went away, and not once did I feel better on it. Never could get up to a therapeutic dose.
* Lurasidone (NO IDEA!) - Been on this for 2 weeks... I feel so sick all the time. I'm usually dizzy even when sitting, and almost fell over entirely. Can't leave my house anymore, and have to sit or lye down on and off all day. Chest pains. Collapsing. Gastro issues.

"Hi there, my name is Mintlight and I sadly had to quit taking Geodon after having some success with it for a couple of days, but then on the 5th day I started feeling weak.

4 days in I felt fantastic, I was more active and interested in living life instead of feeling like a blank slate most of the time. Theb the flu symptoms started, irritability and fever, sore throat along with it. I didn't feel safe taking them so I quit cold turkey. 

When I was trying to fall asleep I had the most vivid hallucinations of walking in a forest, when I opened my eyes it was just the regular layout of the room. For a moment I felt like I was falling and then intense ringing in my ears.

Today has left me feeling similar to how covid felt like, so I did a test and that came out negative. It clearly was caused by my meds.

It leaves me with a bittersweet feeling that I'll never find the right one. I've tried dozens before, all with varying seemingly rare side effects always popping up, rendering me pretty spent.

In general day to day operations I can function somewhat fine. I'm just so exhausted every day with little energy for the things that I'd love to do in my spare time, be more sociable etc.

Geodon helped with that to an extent,

I will however continue trying finding the right one. Stability and improved quality of life is so worth it on the right ones, as I strongly believe that a mix of meds and therapy would lead to a road of healing, at least empirically supported that is.

"I am a 30F, and in my early 20s I was in two separate, very traumatic relationships which left me emotionally and mentally scarred. After the end of the second, I blacked out for 6 months and do not remember doing any of the terrible/manic things I did. I still think about and am affected by those terrible relationships and the aftermath of that 6-month period today. I finally sought help with a therapist and psychiatrist, and was diagnosed with BP type 1 disorder in 2014.

Years later, fast forward to today, I finally have found the right combo of medications to help me stay stable. I took a genetic test to help determine the right cocktail.

My question is, can BP be trauma induced? I thought I was a pretty normal girl prior to these relationships.

"So I have been having throbbing headaches that over the last year have become 24/7 for a year plus now, with ""head spinning"" dizzy spells.  They get worse the more I exert myself physically, it's been getting to the point now that trying to push myself at work is causing my head to throb so much it hurts at I'd say a 5-6 pain level at times, and my head gets spinning so fast that I feel I could lose my balance or pass out. I mean now just st walking and standing for a while can cause some dizziness on its own.

So I have not had a ""yearly"" check-up in now two years.

I also overheat easily but that I assume is just one of my meds and can ""easily"" live with that (I'm not on lithium or anything like that).  I have not had any permanent medications increased, had a couple up then right back down low change in dosage adjustments of two meds that prevent the starts of hypomania from taking hold.

But should I see my psychiatrist first (it would be virtual appointment) as he is the one who has currently prescribed all my meds, my GP first, I tried to call the scheduling department there and got voice mail, and they are usually booked 2-3 months out).  Or should I see both, to rule out a physical health problem.  (One of my friends has been trying to get me to see my GP about my constant 24/7 headaches for over a year now).

I've tried just about every medication at this point. I thought I was finally getting stable after months of bullshit, but then I ran out of my anxiety med and didn't get more for a week. Going cold turkey was apparently a terrible idea but I thought I didn't have more refills. Then my psych also decided to up my Risperidone dose when we got the anxiety meds sorted again. 

I was doing good before with the anxiety meds, Risperidone, and Citalopram - the anxiety felt more manageable and I only was getting the occasional bout of hypomania, but was otherwise good. 

Now I'm just feeling so unstable. Feel flashes of hypomania for a bit and then back to feeling like I just want to off myself so I don't have to deal with this anymore. I want to buy and do everything but then when I actually get close to doing it, I get overwhelmed or depressed and stop. Even with the anxiety med, my anxiety is getting so bad that I've had multiple panic attacks over nothing. It feels like all that stability just vanished and like I'm back to where I was when my doctors were changing meds on me every week. 

I'm just so tired of this. I wish I could go back to when I seemed to only have depression and anxiety and had everything managed on just a simple antidepressant. This has just been absolute insanity and I feel like I've lost my mind.

"First time poster long time lurker:

From Jan - March of this year (Feb being the height of it) I had a severe manic episode. It was my first episode and itâ€™s left me pretty traumatized and I truly donâ€™t know how to forgive myself for the actions I did. I donâ€™t want to get into too much detail on this post but essentially I had severe delusions that caused me to lash out at my friends, harassed and stalked a girl I liked, believed the government was tracking me. That I was a whistleblower and became secret friends with Edward Snowden, believed people were making secret music playlists for me, that people were communicating with me through posts and messages. Thereâ€™s so much more to it thatâ€™s just the surface. I lost my closest friend who needed to take time away from me, and I donâ€™t know if it will ever be the same. But the most traumatizing part was when I harassed that girl. It goes against every moral fiber in my being and Iâ€™ve actively rallied against any form of emotional abuse my entire life. I donâ€™t know how to forgive myself and itâ€™s fucked with my emotional and mental health since it has happened. Basically Iâ€™m asking if anyone wants to chat with me about their manic episode, and Iâ€™d be happy to share more. I think I need to talk to other people who have gone through similar experiences because right now I feel so ashamed and disgusted at myself. How do you deal with the shame and guilt?

"Long Post. 
I guess Iâ€™ll start from the beginning. Aug 2021 I met this man in my city who was here on a work job. I fell madly in love with him during a manic episode. He was great and then out of no where he started treating me awfully. Decided to ends things in mid October and by December I was abusing drugs and alcohol to forget him. Made myself a promise that all that would stop when I was ready to settle down. Met my now fiancÃ© in January 2022. He has been the biggest blessing in my life. The most amazing man I had ever met. Things are great for a couple weeks and then I lash out. I start screaming and crying and throwing things at him, over the littlest shit ever. I have tried to stop drinking alcohol. Quitting the drugs was the easiest thing Iâ€™ve ever done, but alcohol? Itâ€™s got a grip on me. Fast forward to this past weekend 9/2/22. After work him and I decided to hit the clubs with my coworkers. Everything was going great and smooth. Iâ€™m getting extremely drunk and Iâ€™ve spent over $300 on alcohol for all of us. We ended up at a club and me with a drink in each hand spilling it everywhere. I had accidentally spilt it on 2 girls and nearby and I rushed over to apologize. After the apology I turn around and throw the drinks in my FiancÃ©s face and push him and start screaming at him at the top of my lungs. Saying things like you cheated on me and youâ€™ve put ur hands on me so many times. And he has NEVER done any of those things. I do not know where that came from. It turned into the worst night for everyone. My coworkers have now seen me like this and I feel so much shame and guilt. My fiancÃ© is still in shock about everything. Saturday he took the ring off my finger and that almost had me sent to the hospital. My mother had to come and try to calm me down. Cops were called and they talked me out of going to the hospital.

"My post from yesterday got deleted because of rule 9, so i try again with better sources and citation.  


I was astonished to learn that science sees a connection between an overreactive immune system and bipolar disorder. Translated from a German psychiatry textbook, which says ""it became ever more clear in recent years that the immune system plays a decisive role in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, as it does with bipolar disorder"".\^1,2,3 

I always thought of mental disorders as something merely genetic, neurological or psychological, so i found that surprising: What could physical reactions to viruses and bacteria have to do with a mood disorder? As it seems, speculation about this connection started in the 90s, when researches found out that BD affects more people born from December to March, which is flu season (at least in the northern hemisphere).\^4 Apparently, an influenza infection during pregnancy increases the risk for BD for the baby by the factor 4!\^5 Who would have thought? (I am also born in March, so maybe that's even part of my personal pathogenesis!) Another study claims that a dysfunction of the immune system is crucial for the onset and progress of BS and therefore encourages the use of anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of BD.\^6

At this point I realized that i had a lot of inflammations all my life. Could it be that my brain is kind of inflamed during episodes? I recalled when i took ibuprofen (anti inflammatory pain killer) because of tooth ache years ago: Back then i noticed that my anxiety attacks where completely gone whenever i took it. I quickly stopped doing that as i was afraid of getting addicted, but it seems there was something to it:  
""Supportive for this \[above mentioned study\] post mortem studies were able to find a multitude of altered neuro-inflammatory agents in bipolar patients \[...\]""\^7 I spare you the list of exotic pro-inflammatory molecule, biomarker and transmitter names, which were found in higher concentration in bipolar brains\^8, it seems pretty clear to science around the globe that our brains are inflamed, not only during episodes, but also in euthymic states. We seem to be chronically inflamed, at least a little bit. 

Another aspect of our altered immune system is comorbidity with diseases that result from a dysfunctional immune system, i.e. auto-immune diseases (MS, rheumathoid arthritis)\^9.   


In general it seems as if the immune system of bipolar patients is over-reactive, especially to stress, and reacts differently.\^10   


I found all of this really interesting, because i could relate so much with my experience. I always felt that i have a strong immune response and that especially during mania nothing could knock me out. I always had this slightly inflamed feeling, but never connected it to symptoms of bipolar. Also i never heard of that, in spite of reading about the disorder for years already. So i wanted to share. 

 As i my previous post was removed, i want to emphasize that i only paraphrase medical knowledge from a university textbook, that i do not want to claim that bipolar is an autoimmune disease or spread any misinformation. I convey in best faith what professors of psychiatry publish, but am no professional myself.

"I'm interested in the thoughts of those of us that are older, and have been diagnosed a good while.

Who knows you are bipolar? Who do you tell and why?

When I (40, diagnosed 21 years) was young I told anyone who would listen. Time has passed and now the only ones that know are family and my best friend.

I stopped telling people for a number of reasons, but I would like to hear the thoughts of those described.

Who do you share your diagnoses with and why do you do it?",bipolar_disorder
"Hello folks!! As many of us know, SSRIs /kill/ any sort of libido we may have. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 with manic episodes lasting months at the least and depressive episodes lasting a few weeks at most. I was on Prozac for roughly a year and during this time I was completely celibate as my sex drive was nonexistent. Before taking the Prozac, I doubted that I was completely monogamous. I had explored polyamory with a polycule and enjoyed myself. 

I've been off of Prozac for about 2 months now and finding myself dating more and more couples, having safe group sex on a pretty regular basis, and just generally being more promiscuous. I'm very happy with my sex life now and I'm not risking pregnancy, STIs, or anything negative that comes with sex. My partners have all been tested and I've been getting myself tested regularly. We also use protection, hence not intentionally risking anything. 

My issue comes with not KNOWING for certain if this is something I'd have done medicated or if this is just the result of a new manic episode. Has anyone else dealt with anything similar? I'd love to hear stories, mostly so that I know I'm not alone in this.",bipolar_disorder
"Hi there I think I just experienced hypomania for long period it started on Sunday and I think itâ€™s finally done. I felt very high and energised and talkative everyday was willing to talk to pretty much anyone which is unusual because I have anxiety. But I couldnâ€™t feel or use my muscles properly the entire time, opening doors and driving ( I had to drive to work) was ridiculously hard for me I couldnâ€™t focus at all or sit still. I couldnâ€™t even feel the pressure of the water  hitting me it felt super strange I could feel hot and cold but not the water. The minute I tried running I was immediately exhausted I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s because I couldnâ€™t feel my muscles properly at the time but as soon as I stopped running I felt energised again it was confusing. But now I feel high but my muscles are sort of working again, just not fully but I donâ€™t have as much energy as I did yesterday. Idk whatâ€™s going on with me. I donâ€™t have the proper diagnosis. I havenâ€™t felt like this for long periods I only used to when I was super anxious but I havenâ€™t been anxious.",bipolar_disorder

My insurance changed so I had to get a new psychiatrist and she tells me she has a question mark next to that diagnoses. When I asked her what she thought it was she said she is not sure, but as I've only had maybe 6 manic episodes in the last 10 years that didn't last longer than a week at most. I'm not sure what to think. I have built my life around this diagnoses. Also when I asked if that means I can stop taking my meds she said no it's too dangerous until they can correctly diagnose me.",bipolar_disorder

"Hey friends. Im having a lot of confusion because of the medications ive been prescribed mixed with my diagnoses. Ive been diagnosed with ADHD, Bipolar (rapid cycling), and BPD (borderline personality disorder). Im currently prescribed olanzapine, fluvoxamine, vyvanse, and a strong dose of doxycycline (antibiotic) for my Lyme disease. Based on my history with SSRI/SNRI medications, theyâ€™ve done nothing but cause problems for me yet my psychiatrist just prescribed me fluvox, with is an SSRI. im worried all of these drugs together will push me into a manic episode. based on research ive done, the fluvox, vyvanse, and doxy can all trigger mania in patients with bipolar disorder so I guess iâ€™m wondering why in the world my doctors would put me on all of them together. Ever since starting doxy and fluvox, my mood swings have been very rapid and intense, more than usual (since i have BPD thatâ€™s a common occurrence, but it hadnâ€™t been happening this often for a long time) and my sleeping habits have been different. Those are the only major things ive noticed so far, but again, im worried im on the route to mania because of these drugs. Is this something i need to bring up to my doctors and psychiatrist?",bipolar_disorder
"To preface this, Iâ€™ve been on Vraylar for over a year, and havenâ€™t had a manic episode since.  I think itâ€™s the perfect medicine for me.

Anyway, since I started a new job, Iâ€™ve been getting an average of 4-5 hours of sleep a night.  

I think itâ€™s because Iâ€™m doing night shift and Iâ€™m adjusting to the schedule.  Also the job is pretty stressful, so that could add to it.

Iâ€™m just curious if this lack of sleep is something I should be worried about.  I donâ€™t want to trigger a manic episode, as the last one was so traumatizing.",bipolar_disorder
"My lithium dosage was up to 300mg a week ago and the last few days I have felt extremely hungover. Is this normal? Iâ€™m sitting here and my head is spinning, and that hasnâ€™t went away for 3 days.

"When I fist started Zoloft my dose was 12.5mg, then 25mg, 37.5, and now Iâ€™m at 50 after about 2 months. From the fist dose I didnâ€™t notice much of an effect but when I increased my dose my self esteem got very high. Around this time I was just starting school again and usually I have quite bad anxiety but when I started it this year I had none( like literally none at all). At this time I also was having lots of energy when I got home from school, like I was running around my basement for no reason. Also whenever I was winding down for bed I would get lots of frantic thoughts, but idk if thatâ€™s just anxiety. The other dose increases had the same effect but it was not as intense as the first. These symptoms go away after around like 5-6 days. All of these together makes me think I might have had a hypo manic episode. I have a friend who is diagnosed with bipolar and he says itâ€™s likely I do as well. I kinda just want your guys opinion on my situation. Does this mean Iâ€™m bipolar?

    I think itâ€™d be in my best interest to apply for like part time disability (where I would be able to work a part time job for 20 hours a week because I think mentally I can handle it.)

I tried working for a month after my traumatic event, crashes and burned, and eventually went on loa which was supposed to be for two months and keeps getting extended because itâ€™s not improving. I even got inpatient to a mental hospital. My psych even took tests for my cognitive ability and it failed so bad.

"I said I would post an update so here it is! 

To recap: although my thyroid levels are within the normal range, my doctor suggested we try me on a thyroid hormone supplement to combat my lingering depressive symptoms. It's not an FDA approved treatment (and never will be because the thyroid hormone is generic &amp; no one is going to spend the money required to get FDA approval on a generic drug) but it has seen some success in several studies. 

It's been about three weeks since I started the new medication (Liothyronine 25mcg). We started me on a pretty low dose but even so, I've seen some improvement. My average night's sleep over the past three weeks has gone from 10.5hrs to just under 9.5hrs, and I've started waking up before my alarm more often than not. It may not seem like much but an extra hour in my day is a pretty big deal for me. I'm also not feeling as tired during the day, so I'm able to more effectively utilize my time spent awake. I haven't noticed any negative side effects at this dose. 

Since I've tolerated the 25mcg, we're increasing my dose to 50mcg (the dose recommended by the literature my doctor has been reading) and hoping to see continued improvement. I will post another update in a few more weeks if anyone is interested. I'm also happy to answer any questions to the best of my ability.",bipolar_disorder

"Hi, I was prescribed mood stabilizers because my psychiatrist feels I am bipolar because I was on Effexor beforehand and I felt it was making me feel more tense and was told that people that either donâ€™t have depression or are bi polar can experience that side effect. 

I was then prescribed caplyta and have been taking it as prescribed for a few days and I havenâ€™t noticed anything positive so far; just feeling more lethargic than usual, nausea, and weird cold sweats. 

My problem isâ€¦. I donâ€™t feel like I am bipolar. Asking peers and taking online tests, I scored a heck no on the bipolar scale. I never experience mania. I just always feel drained and blah and sometimes stressed drained and blah. But my mood is pretty stable. If anything, I feel like I am autistic and have adhd, but I know both of those are hard to get diagnosed as an adult.

"Two days ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder NOS. My psychiatrist also confirmed my ADHD as well as Generalized Anxiety Disorder. My doctor was already treating the ADHD, but he thought the anxiety was a big symptom (which is common with ADHD). Itâ€™s official though- I have 3 co-morbidities. My psych prescribed me with 10mg of Ritalin for the ADHD (Iâ€˜ve just come off of Adderall, not very effective I noticed after a while), 10mg of Escitalopram for the GAD (Also just came off of Effexor which I plateaud hard on), and 250mg of Divalproex for the Bipolar NOS. I â€˜m NOS because I donâ€˜t fit the tradition cycles on bipolar and I also donâ€˜t experience much depression outside of my menstrual cycle. The mania comes out as irritability and anger. Iâ€™m very reactive and can explode when plans go off course. 

The reason I saw a psych (something I tried to do at the beginning but got lazy with becuase I was getting treatment anyway) is because I recently got in a screaming match at a bar with some women I thought were friends. They probably thought we were friends too, but we donâ€™t really talk now. They were quick to write me off as crazy. I hate that word. But they donâ€™t care about mental health like other friends of mine so I figure they donâ€˜t understand the struggles people who do care go through- if that makes sense. 

In my experience, not knowing can be good and bad. Good because you figure lots of people go through similar stuff and maybe itâ€™s an off day. Bad because not everything can be explained as an off day. Knowing is good and bad too. Good because youâ€˜re another step further into your own self-awareness and you can become more compassionate and forgiving to others and yourself. So many good reasons to knowing. Bad because fuck sometimes you just wish you didnt need a name for it to make sense. 

Iâ€™m Bipolar. Thatâ€™s not a bad thing at all. One of my best friends is Bipolar II and Iâ€™m one of the people she told when she suspected it. Iâ€™ve been with her through a lot of it. Itâ€™s a lot though when you find out for yourself. 

Having a mood disorder is different than having something like ADHD that has so much to do with processing and function. The GAD isnâ€™t that much of a surprise. 

I donâ€™t want anyone reading this to be offended- I guess I just needed to vent in a space that might understand the initial stage of this stuff. Iâ€™m a little overwhelmed and appreciate spaces of the internet like this because mental health can be such a lonely journey. Have a great weekend &lt;3",bipolar_disorder

"This is one of the best descriptions of clinical depression (of which I have had on occasion and I'm sure that many of you have also). It's from one of my favorite writers...David Foster Wallace.

â€œWhen people call it \[depression\] I always get pissed off because I always think depression sounds like you just get like really sad, you get quiet and melancholy and just like sit quietly by the window sighing or just lying around. A state of not caring about anything. A kind of blue kind of peaceful state â€¦ Well this - isnâ€™t a state. This is a feeling. I feel it all over. In my arms and legs â€¦ All over. My head, throat, butt. In my stomach. Itâ€™s all over everywhere. I donâ€™t know what to call it. Itâ€™s like I canâ€™t get enough outside it to call it anything. Itâ€™s like horror more than sadness. Itâ€™s more like horror. Itâ€™s like something horrible is about to happen, the most horrible thing you imagine â€“ no, worse than you can imagine because thereâ€™s the feeling that thereâ€™s something you have to do right away to stop it but you donâ€™t know what it is you have to do, and then itâ€™s happening, too, the whole horrible time, itâ€™s about to happen and also itâ€™s happening, all at the same time. â€¦ Everything gets horrible. Everything you see gets ugly. Lurid is the word. â€¦ Thatâ€™s the right word for it. And everything sounds harsh, spiny and harsh-sounding, like every sound you hear all of a sudden has teeth. And smelling like I smell bad even after I just got out of the shower. Itâ€™s like whatâ€™s the point of washing if everything smells like I need another shower.â€",bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™m curious about the different manic symptoms or habits people typically exhibit and what they typically donâ€™t. I know for instance a lot of people have hyper sexuality, I think part of my PTSD inhibits a lot of that when Iâ€™m manic so I donâ€™t really get that. I also am a bit fiscally anxious so I donâ€™t tend to over spend anymore manic than when in a depressive episode. 

However, I do have some more common and maybe uncommon traits. I get the high energy, going a week or two with 3-4 hours a sleep a night, inflated optimism, substance use after being cold turkey sober etc. 

But I also have some traits I havenâ€™t seen or read about about. For instance I go to the gym and exercise a lot more manic. The other and probably most damning habit is I fall into deep gaming binges when manic and have no self control. Can just game from the time Iâ€™m off work until 2am. 

Anything peculiar or maybe common manic traits you have?",bipolar_disorder
" I'm sorry if this isn't the right sub to post this. Mods can take this down if it's inappropriate.
So I've hit the treasure and it's almost 2 months since I had an episode. I mean I did have a violent one but it is better than multiple violet ones, right ?

I've decided to take the path of self improvement and it's working. I've been meditating 20 minutes everyday and taking cold showers, getting in 8 hours of sleep and the most important part....I stopped porn and masturbation.

I tried to stroke one out yesterday (without porn) and I couldn't even get hard. I'm really sad about it. But I tried today and got  semi hard. 

Meds I am on:
Risperidone, lithium and another blue pill I'm not sure of. But she told me it'd make me motivated to do things and reduce depression. I don't know if I can call it anti depressant.


Any guys experienced this before ? Is it porn withdrawal or Ed?",bipolar_disorder

"Hey guys. I just wanted to know your thoughts on using cannabis. Any tips or advice? I am 8 months sober from alcohol and cannabis but plan to use it medicinally soon.

"Thatâ€™s what he said to me. But if they did have days like this, then they would have called. They would have come and they would have stayed

They would know what itâ€™s like. But they donâ€™t. Iâ€™m in the middle of a mixed episode right now and itâ€™s hell.

But if you have been through hell, you donâ€™t just walk away when someone else is like this. You do everything you can to help. Because thatâ€™s what I want, more than anything right now, I want it to end and I want help. 

I have this stupid fucking rule. I have this belief that if something good can come out of something shit, then somehow, on some mental plain, my personal demons didnâ€™t get to win. The trauma my father inflicted on me doesnâ€™t get to win. The turned away glances of a dozen so called friends donâ€™t get to win. Every person who ever made me feel worthless doesnâ€™t get to win. 

Itâ€™s silly. But I believe it. 

So I just want you to know, if you are going through hell, some strange god somewhere put our cells next to each other.  And if you are going through hell, I would hold your hand and I would sit with you and I would wait for it to pass. And if you are going through hell I would match every self hating thought with love for the amazing human being that you are. 

If you are going through hell, I would not say â€œwe all have days like thatâ€. I would say, you were dealt a shit hand, my friend. You are bipolar. A lot of people wonâ€™t understand. A lot of people wonâ€™t know how bad it gets, or how to help, or what itâ€™s like to want anything, anything at all to make it stop. 

But we do. 

And every little thing you do to fight counts. Every faked smile and quiet cry, and repeated mantra that â€œthis too shall passâ€ and every imagined better day and every microscopic act of self care, and every moment you held on, it all counts. 

You goddamn count. 

We are fighters. And when I see my fellow bipolars thatâ€™s what I see. Brave people with so much fight, like you wouldnâ€™t believe.  

I just wanted to say I think you are a fighter. And nothing will ever rob you of that dignity. No matter what your brain does, on some level, I respect you even when you break.

And they donâ€™t all have days like this. 

Thatâ€™s why I posted here. Because I wanted my people to see, I wanted people who have days like this around me. Even if they are on the other side of a keyboard. 

I wanted to hold your hand. 

And if you are going through hell I want you to know that Iâ€™d hold yours. 

Thank you for taking the time to hear me.",bipolar_disorder
"I (20f) broke up with my now ex boyfriend of 3 years (22m) 3 weeks ago.

Long story short, I pretty much lost everything and now have to start over. I moved in with my mom, I had to re-home my precious dog, I had to quit my job, I lost my car and my ex took my last paycheck so I donâ€™t have a penny in the bank.

Iâ€™ve been completely numb about the whole break up and the only thing Iâ€™ve cried about was my dog. 

Anyway, I pretty much immediately started planning to travel solo full time as Iâ€™ve always wanted to travel but my ex didnâ€™t. I would be working a fully remote work-from-home job from a laptop with the help of a personal wifi stick and staying in hostels or small apartments I can rent month by month (I havenâ€™t decided yet). My plan is to basically go somewhere, stay there for a few months and experience the culture, visit places, etc.. until I feel like my time there is spent and then find a new location with new housing and move there next and so on.

And all of this kinda has me wondering if Iâ€™m just an adventurous girl who canâ€™t wait to enjoy her new found freedom or if Iâ€™m manic. Honestly either way Iâ€™ll probably go through with my plan because I really really wanna travel.",bipolar_disorder

I was in a depressive episode for 6 months but about three weeks ago I woke up and it was like something in my mind had just switched overnight. I didn't think much of it at first because I'm diagnosed with SAD and my depression has always disappeared during spring. Though this year it has been very different. At first I just had a lot more motivation than I had had during my depressive episode. I finished 6-10 assignments a day, slept for 3-5 hours, was really creative, started drawing and writing again, decorated my room, went out with friends etc. I had a really good time and was constantly on top of the world.

I have so many things I want to do and I also have the motivation to do these things but my mind is racing 24/7 and I'm not able to keep up with it. I feel so overwhelmed. I can't sleep, I spend the nights doing research on random topics (which is nothing new since I also have ADHD) but I just really want to rest for one second.

"long story short: my psychiatrist is repeatedly refusing to give me a diagnosis evaluation and i want to know if i should change psychiatrist, or if this is completely normal. 

i already had a depression diagnosis during the first appointment i had with my psychiatrist when she decided to start giving me mood stabilizers instead of antidepressants . at that point i had felt like i had been misdiagnosed for over a year, so the second appointment i told her about it and she told me it was â€˜probablyâ€™ just mood swings [i barely even had a chance to give her any information]. she told me we could consider the possibility of me being misdiagnosed in 2-3 appointments , which is literally half a year. 
i ended up writing a LONG email of symptoms that i had for borderline, and she only looked at 1/15 and said â€˜that sounds like a manic episodeâ€™ and i guessed she re diagnosed me with bipolar and didnâ€™t even tell me?.

i donâ€™t believe my new bipolar diagnosis is wrong but i still strongly believe i have borderline as well and a mental health professional i spoke to gave me an evaluation for it, but theyâ€™re unable to diagnose me.  instead they encouraged me to talk to my psychiatrist more about it. so i did. and my psychiatrist told me to talk to a therapist to see if i have it??? is that normal???? she told me to reconnect with my old therapist who 1. i canâ€™t see because iâ€™m too old and 2. she quit last year. 

not to mention i donâ€™t feel comfortable taking one of the medications she prescribed me and sheâ€™s refusing to prescribe me a different medication unless i do a â€˜trialâ€™ 

she also forced me to stopped taking a medication because of a situation she mixed up and when i told her that situation didnâ€™t happen to me, she still refused to allow me to take it. she eventually apologized and allowed me to take it more, but she then forgot to re-prescribe it for me, so when i went to go pick up my prescription because i had almost none left [lithium] they couldnâ€™t give it to me and i was left without anything",bipolar_disorder

Hi 23F I currently live with my parents. Today my mom walked into my room and said that I donâ€™t comb my hair, I donâ€™t go out, I stay in bed all day, and I donâ€™t find a job am I not embarrassed of myself? I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder while in college. I sometimes get very depressed and during those depressive episodes I have no motivation to do anything. I couldnâ€™t even graduate college cause of it. I had a job about 3 months ago but I quit cause of a toxic and bad work environment and other reasons. Ever since then Iâ€™ve been very depressed. My mom knows this. After my mom asked me that question I felt horrible about my self. The last thing I want to be is an embarrassment to my family. I  help her run errands and take my brother to and from school everyday so Iâ€™m not seen as a leech or lazy. I also try to hang out with her anytime she asks (even though she makes comments about my weight that me feel bad every time we are together) I suck it all up and do everything she askes of me. I understand her wanting me to get a job but her asking me if Iâ€™m not embarrassed of myself I felt was a little harsh considering she knows what Iâ€™m going through. Anyway Iâ€™ve been looking for a job and trying to make my exit plan. Being bipolar is my issue and I donâ€™t want to be a burden to anyone. Am I over reacting? Is she right?

"I first thought I was bipolar years ago when I was 13. I went to the doctor when my depression got worse, and they diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. Years passed, I tried most of the common antidepressants and they didn't work or gave me side effects. I convinced myself that they were right and I wasn't bipolar because everyone else in my family was unipolar depressed and I must have wanted to be different.

A few years later, I was seeing a nurse practitioner as a psychiatrist, and I eventually asked her about potentially having bipolar disorder. I had really high energy spells that were beginning to lead me to risky sex, impulsive choices, unusual purchases, etc. Eventually, my nurse practitioner put me on Lamictal and Lexapro despite not wanting to diagnose me with anything. Then I had to leave her care. I kept taking Lamictal and Lexapro for a while, and the addition of the Lamictal actually had me feeling good. I was able to do my work in college, and it was a marked improvement from before. Between that and some suspicious judgment calls I continued to make sometimes when I was feeling good, I began to suspect that I had bipolar again.

Today, I met with a new psychiatrist. I hate that I have to keep flipping around, but there has been a lot of moving in my life, unfortunately. He put me on Vraylar and Cymbalta and said it was likely bipolar depression because I had been on the Lamictal. I finally got a doctor that was willing to say it out loud, but it doesn't feel good. Now I'm worried that this is an outcome I manipulated into occurring. 

What if by asking my nurse practitioner about bipolar, I manipulated her into giving me Lamictal? And then this second doctor just kind of accepted it without question, so now I have what I wanted? I wish there were a way to know definitively. I know what I experience is real on an intellectual level, but it's hard to believe at the same time.

TL;DR: A doctor finally believes I have bipolar, but now I feel like I don't really have it and I tricked them into thinking that.",bipolar_disorder
"I created this list because I've found it can be easier to pick up these signs than other early signs of hypo/mania. As my judgment becomes impaired, I can still recognize these signs pretty well and take steps early on to mitigate the episode. These don't all apply to everyone, but I know that many of us share them. 

1. Decreased need for sleep (this is the most obvious and most universal sign).
2. Decreased appetite (forgetting to eat, feeling nauseous when trying to eat, or simply feeling full from smaller than usual portions).
3. Enhanced athletic performance (this can be determined objectively by using metrics like mile pace). 
4. Increased pain tolerance.
5. Decreased sensitivity to cold.
6. Difficulty sitting still (I know this is an obvious one). 
7. Increased sex drive AND finding a wider range of people sexually attractive. 
8. Fast heart rate.
9. Perception of being lighter.
10. Having the urge to tap your fingers or feet.

Non-physiological signs that can be determined fairly objectively despite impaired judgment:

1. Sending more texts and longer texts. Writing longer sentences (as you can see from my numerous parentheticals, I'm slightly elevated right now).
2. Laughing more frequently.*
3. Optical illusions (seeing things out of the corner of your eye).
4. The desire to take off your clothes (not all of us become exhibitionists while manic, but I certainly do haha).*
5. Being surprised when you look at a clock that much less time has passed than you thought.
6. Having the desire to sing and dance.*
7. Noticing that other people seem to be talking incredibly slowly.
8. Difficulty reading.
9. Racing thoughts.
10. Mirror gazing.*

*Typically only applies to euphoric mania.

I hope this helps in identifying the early signs of hypo/mania!",bipolar_disorder

Iâ€™ve made a lot of progress, Iâ€™m over 6 years sober, I havenâ€™t been suicidal in a long time, and I used to only be able to have like one good week out of every several months and now I can go like 5 months without feeling like shit again. But itâ€™s still so fucking hard. Iâ€™ve been so depressed and feel like Iâ€™m consumed by stress and burnout. On paper my life looks perfect. Job, husband, kid I adore, the american dream. But my brain tells me it will all fall apart and I feel like I never get a break from constant responsibilities. When I was younger and felt depressed I could just stay in bed, listen to emo music, smoke a cigarette, and zone out. Now I have to wake up early everyday, plan everyoneâ€™s meals, clean, work full time, and just basically pretend Iâ€™m fine because so many people rely on me being fine.

Basically, he said he couldn't deal with someone who's sister has cancer. I was furious, because it was just so cold. But, he was very depressed that day. And he apologised a lot afterwards. Then he said he'd like to stay over the summer and I said yes. That was about 6 weeks. Then he changed it to 4 months without even asking me. But I got my head around it - I love him, and we get along very well. But then he said permanently, and still didn't ask me. I know he's desperate to leave where he lives, but I am not happy to be just a port in a storm. I'm his girlfriend. We should talk about it. Then he said he was randomly coming down this week, and I got all excited, then he strongly implied he wanted to cancel because he could only be here a day and a half (because he randomly agreed to meet his dad for a curry?!)

"18M Pansexual here. When I was a little boy aged 8 a voice came into my head telling me to do things that I wouldn't normally do since I had no friends at the time (still don't) I followed it and I did what it told me to do but some of the things were kinda bad like run over and throw something at someone and I will be rewarded as this imaginary friend thing but it wasn't anyway if I refused to do the thing it told me to do it would bully me tell me I ain't worth living and so on it got worse when I was 12 cause I was being abused for 5 years everyweek by my mother's ex bf anyway time went on and then I started cutting myself because of bullies. I would get my baseball bat and hit my head with it and them hit my legs with it saying words like ""You won't ever be loved"" ""Kill yourself"" over and over while crying I was doing this because my ocd was hurting so bad and the thoughts I was thinking of like murdering people and becoming a mass murderer cause of my ocd intrusive thoughts this was like a punishment of mines for thinking like this but I really enjoyed these thoughts.

I had alot of trouble with depersonalization while in high school where I would have panic attacks of not feeling real that would last 5 minutes it was horrible but now after a bad wees experience I have gotten persistent depersonalization derealisation everyday and it won't go away. It was like a panic attack all the time when I first got it..

Anyway for the past year I've been super scared I keep looking out the window and when I'm outside looking around I keep thinking people are out to get me and kill me or something because I've had bad experiences with people online saying they are gonna find me and kill me or whatever. My diagnoses are OCD Autism and Anxiety people just really think I'm not okay and that never used to be the case when I was younger I was told by people online it's just you growing up or being an edgelord everyone would say that now everyone thinks I'm not okay. It might be because my blue eyes have gotten really dark and they become really wide often and sometimes my tongue just hangs out of my mouth and then I just stare at something for 2 whole minutes in this relaxed position but in reality I'm just standing up. I once drawn blood on my face and made it look like facepaint and that seems normal to me but to everyone else it doesn't. And this girl just called me a psycho and I haven't even said that I wanted to kill anyone to her.

"Sorry for format... Ya know... Mobile. (TLDR at bottom first paragraph is personal background) 

Longer story shorter, I(27m) was misdiagnosed as clinically depressed with severe anxiety about 3 years ago by a psychiatrist, but went to inpatient at a hospital this past weekend after a depression episode and was diagnosed as bipolar 1. Over the last 3 years I was prescribed Wellbutrin, which gave me happiness highs, and Paxil, that made me feel lower. They started me on Lithium in the hospital and I finally feel some levelness. Unfortunately, the inpatient facility was the worst place I've ever been too. I was admitted willingly, but it was a tramatic experience. I don't want to sit and bad mouth the hospital because they did take good care of the extreme mental conditions people were in but there was no middle ground, I was locked in a room most of the day with not contact with outside other than a broken payphone I had to share with about 30 other people on a single floor. 

So that's the back ground.

My question to the community is: Is there a way I can continue lithium treatment without being inpatient? I want to continue the treatment as the lithium has helped me so much (when they finally gave me it) but I can't be prescribed by the hospital without being in the inpatient for an unknown amount of time. (They told my parents and myself multiple lies during my short time there like, ""He's seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow."" But every tomorrow only a nurse practitioner came because the psychiatrist wasn't in that day. They were not treating me, but we're keeping me in the psychiatric ward of the hospital) Does anyone in the community have experience getting bipolar medication(s) without having to be hospitalized and treated like an animal but can continue working and living while easing into medication? I am currently looking for another psychiatrist with my counselor/therapist but was hoping for some positive information that I won't be locked up again just to get some help.

TL;DR : found out I'm bipolar and want to receive medication but can't mentality survive the inpatient process at my local hospital. How do I get medicated without being removed from society?",bipolar_disorder
"**My Story:**

So, I've been living with other people for the last 6 years of my life. The biggest issue I've always had was getting the people I live with to remember to do clean their dishes, mop the floor, clean the bathroom, etc. I also sometimes had issues with people taking weeks to pay me back for their portion of the Electric or Wi-Fi bill. After facing these issues for years I decided to put my coding skills to good work and see if I can fix my problem and a problem that affects so many others.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I've Tried:**

So, I tried what a lot of other people have to fix these issues. I've tried Cozi, Splitwise, Venmo, OurGroceries and I didn't like any of them for various reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Cozi:**

Â Â Â 1. Poorly Designed

Â Â Â 2. Hard to Understand

Â Â Â 3. Missing Relevant Features (Subtasks, Analytics, Grocery Lists)

**2. Splitwise:** 

Â Â Â 1. Only Does Expenses

Â Â Â 2. Poorly Designed

**3. OurGroceries:**

Â Â Â 1. Poorly Designed

Â Â Â 2. Clunky

Â Â Â 3. Only Does Grocery Lists

**4. Venmo**

Â Â Â 1. Only Does Expenses

Â Â Â 2. People Forget Venmo Requests

&amp;#x200B;

**About The App:**

After months of work, I created WeDivvy. What is WeDivvy? WeDivvy is an app that helps people split chores, expenses, and lists with the people they live with. You can create one-time, repeating, and alternating tasks and the app will automatically remind anyone who's assigned. You can also the track progress of each home member.

&amp;#x200B;

**A few of the features that make WeDivvy awesome :**

â€¢ Simply and Clean UI

â€¢ Create One-Time, Repeating, and Alternating Chores, Expenses, and Lists

â€¢ Wide Range of Scheduling Flexibility

â€¢ Easy to Read Analytics and Progress Tracking

â€¢ Schedule Automatic Reminders

â€¢ Group Tasks into Collections

â€¢ Color Code Tasks

â€¢ Create and Assign Subtasks

â€¢ Create Unlimited Group Chats

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

I made a chore, expense, and list splitting app for people who live with each other. It's better than any other I found. (Reasons listed above)

"Hello people - i hope that someone reads my text and give me some advice. 

I am 26 year old female, married and 2 Kids. My symptoms began may 2019 after the death of my 43 year old dad. He was my one and only - that day changed my lifeâ€¦

It all began with very mild depression, and (ocd) intrusive thoughts. The intrusive thoughts went really aggressiv and made me very scared. First time in my life i decide to go to an psychiatrist. That doctor gave me an ssri named escitalopram - she said i should take 5mg and after 3 weeks i have to take 10 mg. Already at 5 mg it all went worse. I got bad suicidal thoughts, restlessness and other stuff. At 10 mg the first 2 weeks were the hell. All symptoms 150% worse. Then i got tons of energy, did things i never done. Like smoking, driving fast, and spent lots of money for stupid things. I told my doctor, but she ignored it. 

After 2 years with escitalopram, and on off depression i went to another psychiatrist. At that time i was in an really bad state. Deep depression. She gave me Zoloft. Zoloft brought me to psychiatry first time in my life. The doctors there diagnosed my bpd. Told me to drop Zoloft and start venlafaxine. This drug made me suicidal, and agitated. But the doctors said thats normal, it goes away. But it doesnt. I looked for a new doctor at home, and the new doctor said take escitalopram again. 2021 i was 3 times in hospital - and every time they said you have bpd. although i told them that i have hypomanic episodes, where i have tons of energy and lack of sleep - and then for 3-4 weeks depressive episodes. Finally end of 2021 i went to an therapist that said, i might have rapid cycling. 

She transferred my to an psychiatrist which is specialized at Bipolar. That doctor told me i have Bipolar 2/rapid cycling and also bpd. He said escitalopram from 10mg to 5 mg and 900mg lithium. Now after 3 months with this medication, nothing changed. I feel worseâ€¦ the doctor said he want to try lamictal or topamax + the lithium and want to drop the escitalopram. 

I am so afraid going off the ssri - maybe i need it? Also i heard lots of good stuff from lamictal for bipolar depression. Now i am in an mixed episode. Its horrible. What kind of medication worked for you in an mixed episode and for depression??? 

thank you in advance",bipolar_disorder
"This is your daily pro-med post, so if you're feeling particularly anti-meds today, feel free to either scroll by or read at your own risk.

I have Bipolar I, mixed episodes with psychotic features. I've been seeing some posts and comments lately talking about negative side effects, and while I completely understand the frustration that comes from side effects (seriously, I have kidney disease after being on Lithium for 5 years), I also resent that commentary a little bit. I have a pretty serious case of this illness. If I opted out of meds, I'd likely be institutionalized, as my manic episodes feature some pretty wild hallucinations and cause me to do things that are not only out of character but constitute as public disturbances. 

I've been taking Depakote and Abilify for several years now (I've also taken Risperdal and Lithium in the past as previously mentioned) and the weight gain has been getting to me lately. And yet, what choice do I have? I can't just go off my meds and expect that lifestyle changes will help get me through. There's something permanently off with my brain. It's not my fault and it's clearly rooted in genetics, as several of my family members have had similar experiences, particularly in my generation. 

It's important, at least to me, that we treat our illness as an actual illness, one that requires medicine. I've been diagnosed for 10 years now, basically to the day, and while I'm glad that medication is becoming accepted and normalized, there still seems to be a lot of stigma associated with taking medication for serious mental illness, as if we could just ""lifestyle"" our way out of this stuff. I hope that we can turn this around in the coming years. Medication compliance has been my answer to stability.

If I get up out of bed to use the bathroom or get a drink, everything feels completely surreal and floaty and I feel completely disconnected from my body. I canâ€™t process my surroundings and my thoughts arenâ€™t coherent. All I can do during these episodes are sleep. They are different to depressive episodes, because I donâ€™t feel depressed or suicidalâ€¦I just feel nothing but overwhelmingly tired). 
Iâ€™m currently doing my PhD, and Iâ€™m really starting to wonder if I am way over my head or notâ€¦I know the rapid cycling is not sustainable long term, but I just canâ€™t function when I am drugged up to my eyeballs. Has anyone here got any advice or success stories of postgraduate studies- medicated or unmedicated? 
Also, what on earth do I do when my psychiatrist just last minute cancels over a month of appointments?! Heâ€™s not back till April and as far as I know, nobody is covering him ðŸ˜ž",bipolar_disorder
"(I posted this on another bipolar community but I noticed this one is larger so I hope to fr get advice on how to get tired and relax/stop the mania anddd a rant about nothing all at the same time)
 Iâ€™m not too sure what to even say highkey Iâ€™m just here at 4am not been able to sleep for about a week now itâ€™s been especially worse these last 4 days like Iâ€™ve probably had three hours of sleep max which Iâ€™m not complaining I feel great Iâ€™ve been really productive and getting things done and writing since I havenâ€™t been able to sleep but, Iâ€™m starting my new job in two days, mind you itâ€™s in the morning and I have a whole bunch of things scheduled which Iâ€™m kinda getting scared now cause what if I crash before then and then my plans for work and things I had to get done are ruined which gives me anxiety and kinda stresses me that I canâ€™t sleep. But the idea of sleep rn is so like wack I canâ€™t even think or want to lay down rn or put the effort to even sleep when I know im just gonna get back up anyways and I could be doing better things than laying in bed looking at the wall attempting to sleep when I know I wonâ€™t even be able to, Iâ€™ve tried asmr before counting sheep whateverrr I wonâ€™t fall asleep cause I feel like I got too many thoughts and ideas bouncing in my head. Honestly I guess rn you could say Iâ€™m manic which I didnâ€™t really consider till about a few hours ago when I was deep thinking and writing ab things and yesterday when my sister suddenly told me I needed to talk to my psychiatrist cause I needed an up on my dosage and the very few friends I talk to literally asked me â€œhave you been talking to your therapist or seeing your psychiatrist?â€ I was like o. But in a way if I focus hard I guess I could see the behaviors and stuff theyâ€™re talking about. Iâ€™ve been really hypersexual, pretty broke atm cause of money I spent way too much money on brawl stars and a tattoo lmao (like In debt to people broke cause I had to borrow) and Iâ€™ve been very much just talking without even thinking like enough to notice heavy side eyes and my mind wonâ€™t stfu lmao. But yes I am currently on medication im taking 200mg of lamictal, recently my psychiatrist was wondering if she was at a good dosage since weâ€™re in the experimental phase cause I just recently started the whole medication process cause everything was getting messy but thatâ€™s besides the point lol (btw im 21 and wasnâ€™t diagnosed till last year when I was 20). I feel like I didnâ€™t purposely do it I think I was genuinely doing really good and In a very â€œbalancedâ€ place which clearly that wasnâ€™t the case but she decided to keep me at 200mg cause of everything I told her and how balanced I felt (and since itâ€™s over the phone and I was high earlier that day maybe I seemed actually ok to her idk I forgot to tell her I smoked) but imma make sure to tell her I probably need and up but that being so, I feel like for a couple of years now Iâ€™m so used to the really strong ups and downs now that Iâ€™m on medication Iâ€™m not even really too sure what Iâ€™m supposed to feel or like my idea of â€œstableâ€ is blurred, which I havenâ€™t really been experiencing depression episodes as much or as long as they even were I think Iâ€™ve noticed changes but idk at this point I donâ€™t consider my view of myself reliable since I always think Iâ€™m doing great unless Iâ€™m shit depressed but this week I think Iâ€™ve been very much experiencing a mixed episode. Anyways im really grateful at the same time for like the energy and everything I feel like Iâ€™ve been able to get a lot of stuff done and Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of journaling and writing and reading and practicing my tarot again but yeah idk at the same time all this energy is frustrating cause thereâ€™s so much I want to do rn or just people I wanna talk to lmao. Sorry for rambling tbh I could say way more rn but Iâ€™m looking rn and it feels like Iâ€™ve said too much for yâ€™all to even wanna read LMAOO but yes help pls idk Like I said I donâ€™t consider myself reliable like I was just telling people a few days ago like bru I donâ€™t even think Iâ€™m bipolar or mentally Ill at all maybe I was just dramatic af, but thankfully I got friends and family to humble me lmfao BUTT thatâ€™s besides the point idk wtf to do to help me actually just sit and relax so plssss adviceee Lmaoo weed is out the picture rn cause Iâ€™m dirt broke",bipolar_disorder

Starting last Monday I would wake up after 2 hours in a full on panic attack (200bpm heart rate, the works). And Iâ€™ve had crippling anxiety throughout the day which Seroquel had all but eliminated.

Messaged my psychiatrist to let her know what was going on and she never got back to me so I was forced to make my own decisions about medication. Stopped taking the Seroquel which halted the panic attacks, and started back up on my Ativan that I had to use for a decade for anxiety.

Now for the past 7 days I canâ€™t sleep more than 1-2 hours at a time.

"I am diagnosed bipolar and also being treated for possible BPD (I got the most unlucky mix ever.) Iâ€™ve asked him a lot to look into my Illnesses. Heâ€™s seen me go off the deep end before, I wasnâ€™t taking my medicine I was an alcoholic and he kept buying and fueling my addiction and I ended up becoming reactive abusive which I had no excuse for. But I do wish he had seen I needed help. He did messed up things as well and we broke up. Weâ€™ve since gotten back together like a year later and have been together for a year and Iâ€™ve asked him multiple times to look into my disorder so he can see the warning signs and get me help. The other day I was having him read the borderline symptoms and he said oh yeah this sounds like you and I was like have you seriously never looked into this ? And he said maybe awhile ago but I forgot. The first thing I did when we got back together was to please do some research.

I donâ€™t know how to feel about this but it scared me because I canâ€™t always recognize when Iâ€™m going off the deep end or acting manic, my friends and family will notice it before me sometimes but he never had even brought it up or mentioned it.

"I was diagnosed two months ago with BP2. Itâ€™s so hard because I remember what life was like previous to my onset of symptoms, and while I am still in my successful career, with my good friendships, and supportive community, I feel completely disconnected. Iâ€™m constantly afraid Iâ€™m losing my mind, or that maybe others perceive me as being crazy (even though I havenâ€™t disclosed my diagnosis to them). This mistrust of myself has led to deeper depressive episodes, and most days I feel like a shell of my former self. I have anger because I have this mental illness that I never asked for, but these are the cards I am dealt. I have always dreamt of having a family, but I see the statistics and it makes me afraid. I grew up with a schizophrenic mother and I remember how damaging it was, and while I have done everything in my power to heal and pace a new path, I would never want to put a child through the type of instability that seems to come with this diagnosis. My aunt is bipolar 1, and has ruined her relationships with her children and lost custody of them. A few months ago she left her husband, started a relationship with a woman she barely knew and was on a serious drug bender. Now she is back home with her husband. These situations do not apply to everyone with bipolar, however, and for me to simply view life through the context of my familial situations is unfair. 

My newest medication ended me up in the ER on Thursday because of adverse reactions  that made me vomit nonstop leading to severe dehydration. My original med (which I am still taking) Lamictal makes me feel like I am dissociating constantly. I cannot remember anything and I mix and jumble my words and I feel so embarrassed. 

I just want to get better. I just want to be normal. Iâ€™m sorry to be so pessimistic, but I feel like the people in my life love me, but they cannot understand what Iâ€™m going through. I donâ€™t want to remain in this state. Does anyone have tips or advice on what helped them? Bipolar disorder is not a death sentence, and I want to live in a way that breaks the stigma. But I am in need of encouragement. I am a professional with a career and am a high profile person in my community and I am so scared I am losing my grip on things. 

If I have said anything insensitive or ignorant in this post, please let me know as well. I want to know better so that I can do better when it comes to ending the stigma.",bipolar_disorder
"I can feel my marriage slipping away from me, and I don't know what to do about it. We were supposed to be each other's forever people. We love each other SO much. But we can't stop hurting each other. My bipolar and her anxiety just ping pong off one another until we are both complete wrecks. I am transfemme, came out about 8 months ago. She has been unendingly supportive, but she is straight, and honestly the farther along I get in my transition the more I think I'm straight as well. She wants a husband, she thought she had one, but it's not me. I want a husband too. But we don't want to lose each other. Our sex life no longer exists, but we are still intimate and close.

We are polyamorous. She has two other male partners whom she spends one night a week with. Today, for the first time, after a particularly hard day, she opted to leave and stay there on a night she would normally be here, because we are just not healthy for each other right now. I have no other partners right now, and no close friends. So this leaves me completely alone with no one to talk to.

I feel like my marriage is ending tonight. I hope it's not. She plans to come back. But just a month ago none of this was happening, we were committed to staying together and things have just changed so much so fast we both have whiplash.

I guess I just need hugs. There is nothing I can do about this tonight other than try not to dissolve into a puddle of tears as my daughter sleeps in her room.

Zoloft triggered mania
Lithium calmed the mania
Lithium felt useless so tried a few things to augment
Buspar was the ticket in January 
Adderall was the ticket in February 

And for a month Iâ€™ve felt perfect. Rage was in control. Panic was in control. Attention was focused well enough not to cause panic. 

Then this weekend Iâ€™ve had some family/work disruptions. I stayed up late working last night. And I could tell that today was different.

I was undiagnosed at the time and only thought I had depression. I was always in fear of being 'stuck' in a depressive episode and always dreaded the summertime, because that was generally around the time I would feel severely depressed for 2-3 months on end. I also struggle with anxiety and tend to overthink every aspect of my life, particularly academics and career. When I would tell my partner of my fears, sadness, loneliness, anxieties, etc. they would just say I'm 'bringing too much negativity' into their life. During a 3-month long hypomanic episode, my anxiety reached its peak and I eventually broke down, voicing my frustration with why I worry so much, cannot stop my mind from racing, and feel depressed all the time with no explanation.

*He then broke down about his family and went silent, so I felt like a therapist but this whole time I was there he just shut down and sat with his hands on his head, there was no ounce of fun. I even comforted him, hugged him, relaxed him even though he was mean to me most of the day.

*He called me an idiot multiple times as a joke sure, but it made me feel so shit.

* I was also not looking for a relationship yet as it's been 2 weeks of knowing him? but I felt like I wasted my time. I had no fun at all.

*Told me that my car makes me up myself (red mini cooper convertible) 


I just felt like a punching bag the whole time. Do I just get straight with him, I'm pretty pissed off... what should I do? I feel like shit and he has messaged me now

'are you angry with me?' And i couldn't help but get so mean with him and I lashed out at him. I got so nasty. Swearing. Saying I had absolutely no fun, I felt like the whole day was just so serious, i got no escape the whole day, I felt like I was in a serious relationship with him. I was just wanting to have fun with someone.

"Hi. I keep accidentally overdosing on meds. it's not a problem with antipsychotics I don't want to take or anything, just when I'm perscribed benzos or hypnotics for sleep I tend to overdose, either on purpose or because I forgot I already took it (for those that have the effect of forgetfulness). Since recently taking 15 lorazepam tabs in a day and blacking out for nearly half a week doing shit like accidentally setting off the fire alarm in my dorm building (which I definitely could've gotten in serious trouble with my university for), I am looking for a solution. Similar thing happened with zolpidem and landed me in the ER, once happened with alcohol because I didn't realize how much I'd drank, tried to kill myself and I was 5250d. I just tend to think I'm sober when I'm really really not and redose repeatedly.

I don't live with anyone so I don't really have any way for someone to hide shit from me or give me one at a time. My psychiatrist gives me relatively frequent redoses (so I usually don't have enough to /die/ overdose), but it's still a problem even when I only have 10 or so doses, and I can't exactly go to the pharmacy every day.

right now since i need these meds but can't figure out a way to safely use them I feel like I just belong in the hospital, lol. but I know I don't and that I can think of something. I don't want to just say fuck it and stop taking them becasue they really do improve my life. trouble is:

I'm looking at timed pill dispensers and they run $50+ (up to several hundred bucks). I can't really think of any alternative solutions. Anyone have this problem that knows of a good solution? I'm looking for anything under 20 bucks or so. I know it's an important thing but I'm kinda a broke student so I can't afford the hella expensive ones. I don't really want to ask my social worker or psychiatrist because they are reluctant to really perscribe things if they know I'll misuse them, on accident or on purpose, but then I'm sort of left suffering with major sleep/mood problems. I have tried things with lower abuse potential but they work significantly less well.

Manic sister singing all night

The silly girl is brilliant

But sheâ€™s not that bright

Struggling to sleep is hard

When manic sister is screaming out

Musicals about the bard

Filling the home with ranting

Manic sister is fasting and

Wasting away but hey,

Mania breeds inspiration

Manic sister insists its her muse

As music bellows from her speakers

Sheâ€™s reaching for power 

Her manic sister flowering

Into her higher self 

Touching the sky 

Almost flying high

Manic sister is having conversations

The walls donâ€™t talk back but

The foundations echo her lack of judgment

Oh why, manic sister, why?",bipolar_disorder

"Hi everyone,

TDLR: My stressful job is triggering my bipolar 1, which has been untreated for several years. When did you or have you asked for help?

I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about 6.5 years ago after undergoing very severe manic episodes in my undergrad. I had depressive symptoms prior to this, but it wasn't until I was institutionalized against my will that I received a proper diagnosis. I spent four weeks in the hospital, then a couple of weeks later was forcibly institutionalized again for three and a half weeks. A lot of this was triggered by lack of sleep, indulging in substances, and school-related stress. 

Since then, I haven't experienced anything near as manic or traumatic as those experiences. I was put on SSRIs and was unable to attend my classes regularly because of their side effects. So I've essentially been off medication for the last 6 years. I also haven't talked to a therapist in about 5 years.

Currently, the stress from my work situation is triggering symptoms to the point that I get depressed, angry, and upset just about every other week. These feelings lead to hopelessness and despair. Sometimes, it feels like each additional task is the straw that will break the camel's back and will just make me quit entirely. 

I have a serious weight on my shoulders at my current workplace. I am the only person who manages communication/marketing/pr/social media and a variety of other tasks. I've applied to several other positions and unfortunately, I keep getting denied. My work environment can be toxic. About 90% of people in leadership positions have zero work-life balance, are required to be basically on call, and work well into the evenings and weekends. Aside from that, I get paid decently, can manage myself for the most part, and can take time off to do personal things. So, it's not all bad, but the bad certainly seems to be outweighing the good, lately. 

How do you manage work-related stress? How do you know when it's time to trigger options like FMLA or ADA assistance? I'd like to hear some examples of how folks have managed issues like this in their own lives, and what's worked, rather than be told to do x y z. Although I am definitely open to hearing suggestions. 

Thank you",bipolar_disorder
"I (F28) apologize in advance if this is jumbled or even incoherent, but reading this sub has helped me before and I donâ€™t really have anyone else to talk to about it.

I was only diagnosed with BPII last November, but Iâ€™ve been on many meds for my OCD and depression for over a decade now. The only new one added with this diagnosis was lithium. So I take 900mg of that daily, 250mg sertraline, and 300mg bupropion for my psychiatric medications. I can definitely tell when Iâ€™ve missed a couple days, but that rarely happens because Iâ€™m so scared to go off any of them (but thatâ€™s more related to the OCD than anything). I think the lithium is helping with mood stability, but I am definitely feeling the effects of it in regards to brain fog/memory issues.

I can deal with that, but what is unsettling is that lately (and frankly, this might of started before lithium/my BP symptoms really started showing, but my memory is so bad now itâ€™s hard to say) I have been feeling so untethered from reality and time. Like, itâ€™s hard to explain, but it feels like even though I know who I am and where I am, I cannot wrap my mind around how and why I am here and what I am doing in this universe. Itâ€™s not just me, I think that about everyone. And I know thatâ€™s kind of the age old question of humanity, but I donâ€™t know, this time it just feels different. I guess a kind of existential dread? I used to have a pretty healthy attitude towards death (I work in hospice care) as something that happens to each of us, but now the idea of it frightens me so much. I just canâ€™t comprehend how someone can be here one moment and then gone the next. My mind is constantly going in a thousand different directions and Iâ€™m either basically catatonic from being so overwhelmed by my own thoughts or Iâ€™m trying to tire myself out by getting ahead of them through distractions. 

I am going to make an appointment with my psychiatrist about all this, but I feel Iâ€™m not completely honest with him during our sessions and that I easily back down or forget to say or ask things. I guess I just wanted to seek the opinions of others who are also living with BP and if they have experienced anything similar or if this has nothing to do with BP at all? I feel either numb, weepy, or angry all the time now and I donâ€™t know what to do. I have never been happy per se, but it used to be a lot easier to pretend to be and also the bad moods werenâ€™t so ever-present. I am holding it together on the outside well I think. I have a full-time job, keep in close touch with my family, have friends, and take care of my four dogs and two cats on my own. Still, it feels like my brain actually hurts from all the racing thoughts and constant questioning I do.

Iâ€™m a marijuana addict. Iâ€™m not in denial about it, but Iâ€™m still trying to hold on. I need help, because right now I see myself continuing this habit until I destroy my life, with no sense of consequence. What can I do to put myself in the right direction, because Iâ€™m itching to go to a dispensary tomorrow ? I wasnâ€™t able to get high yesterday, and I was noticably agitated. I feel a void, and donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to survive, given my poor mental state. My story is down below, if you donâ€™t want to read it, you can stop here.

I got my medical card last August after a 7 month tolerance break. Weed, combined with living in a hoard, Adderall for my ADHD, and gaslighting from my narcissistic mother sent me into psychosis. I was hospitalized a few days after I got my card, but I believe symptoms were showing up as early as June.

I ran away from my motherâ€™s house to college, where my health completely deteriorated. I blocked my entire family. I was seeing signs of God, the devil, and my parents in the weather, on the Internet, and in my peerâ€™s behavior. I isolated myself in my on campus apartment, looked for spiritual signs on YouTube, spent money on clothes and takeout, and spammed a man I was obsessed with daily. I isolated myself from my friends. I didnâ€™t complete a day of classes, because I thought my school was part of a conspiracy and demonic. I voice messaged all of my friends talking about these conspiracies instead.

In October, my roommates had the EMT unlock the door to my room. I was topless and hugging myself, talking to â€œGodâ€ like he was an invisible man in front of me. I screamed â€œChristâ€ like a gust of wind was going to shut the door and protect me. I was dragged out of my bed and taken to the hospital.

When I got out a week later, all my roommates had left. I did the same thing I was previously doing. I didnâ€™t take the medication that was suggested to me. I was afraid to leave my room. I wouldnâ€™t meet with the school staff. I wouldnâ€™t shower or brush my teeth. In November, I thought someone on YouTube was speaking to me, and I packed up my belongings like they were going to pick me up. I hadnâ€™t left the apartment in weeks. On the same day, the school called my parents, and someone called two therapists from the hospital I was at. They said I wasnâ€™t taking my medication and sent me back to the hospital. I donâ€™t think this was right because even though I was going through psychosis, it wasnâ€™t mandatory that I take that medication. 

I was in the hospital until December 1st. I spent Thanksgiving there. I would hang up on my family members whenever they called. The entire time I was there, and not smoking, I was psychotic and manic. I was out on two medications, and neither of them worked. I experienced psychosis for an entire month after being released, while I was medicated. I smoked immediately after I was, and thought someone was going to kidnap me for sex trafficking. 

I got back in touch with my father, and he moved me into an apartment in January. I texted my friend, who called the ambulance to send me to the hospital in August, and she cut me off. Thatâ€™s when I started to snap out of the psychosis, because I thought I was telepathically communicating with her the entire time. I was extremely depressed after this, and lied in bed and ate all day, every day. Towards the end of the month I got a recreational weed plug. I instantly got psychosis after smoking, thinking people were talking to me online, music was demonic, and that my life was in danger. I couldnâ€™t stop smoking after that, even though I tried to throw the weed away. I dug it out the trash right after, and the shame will stay with me forever. I was completely isolated, only had three friends in the city that I didnâ€™t see, I failed out of college so there was nothing to do, and I briefly worked. On at least four occasions, I thought that I was being spied on, that I was going to get shot, that people were stalking me in cars, that signs were being sent from God and the devil, and that I could telepathically communicate with people on the Internet through muscle twitches. 

I had to move back in with my family since I wasnâ€™t practicing hygiene, cooking, cleaning, working, and taking care of myself. Iâ€™ve been on the couch all day depressed and overeating. Last week I smoked my medical marijuana pen, and thought the left side of my body was possessed. I thought my uncle and my mother were communicating with the devil, and the red on my uncleâ€™s computer screen and the red light on the tv was Hell. I thought my hand twitching was the devil and the government. I put on Christian YouTube to cleanse me. On the same day I recognized these were psychotic thoughts, and tried to scold myself for smoking. I finished the cart and have been smoking on empty carts until yesterday. 

Iâ€™ve been trying to post in here, but kept deleting what I wrote. I knew I was going to try to pull what I could from my empty carts, so I felt fraudulent posting. I tried  smoking all of them yesterday, but they were all empty so I didnâ€™t get a buzz from them, which disappointed me.  I tried looking for a dispensary but the ones near me were all closed or about to close. So, I went to Starbucks instead. 

Weed feels familiar to me, like a friend when Iâ€™m alone. It makes me comfortably numb, and Iâ€™m complacent with life when Iâ€™m high. Iâ€™ve been wanting to numb myself and completely forget that Iâ€™ve been through this, until I spiral in to another psychosis again. It was present during multiple traumatic experiences, which I will make more posts about. I felt immense guilt for smoking weed, blaming my addiction for the abuse that happened to me. 

Iâ€™m going to see a psychiatrist this Thursday 7/7/22 to treat the psychosis and the other diagnoses that I have. Iâ€™m going to be honest about my weed use. The meds I was taking make me feel like a zombie, Iâ€™m slow moving and speaking, and Iâ€™m sluggish. Iâ€™m also not motivated or creative. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll never fully be myself again, and I will cycle between debilitating depression, and psychosis. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll never be able to take care of myself and have an adult life. Iâ€™m looking for support because Iâ€™ve hit rock bottom and Iâ€™m desperate for a reason to keep on going. Thank you for reading, and I hope this adds some perspective.",bipolar_disorder
"I am SICK of politicians and the media blaming mental illness for the mass shootings in America. It is not mental illness that pulls the trigger; it is a moral depravity.

We in the BP community spend our days fighting and managing a disorder that has profound impact on our lives, but it does NOT make us immoral people. Itâ€™s a different kind of sick that makes someone plot and execute a mass shooting â€” a moral illness. There is a HUGE difference.

Itâ€™s not just the shooter either. This moral illness extends to the politicians who would rather blame mental illness than address the major real issues of gun proliferation, as well as the media who spreads the message that the mentally ill are to blame while lauding gun violence as a solution in our entertainment.

So while the morally ill continue their senseless slaughter, the moral and peaceful mental illness community is blamed en masse for these awful peoplesâ€™ repugnant behavior. The stigmatization and prejudice perpetuates into every aspect of our lives.

I don't why but I've been feeling this way for about two weeks now. Before I started to take my meds (it's been a year since I started to take it) I felt angry if I was hungry, but now I've been feeling sad. 

I'm on lamictal, I think I need a new prescription (currently on 25mg). I want to try taking two pills instead of one, like one in the morning and one at the afternoon to see if it helps. Does anybody take their meds this way?",bipolar_disorder

"Iâ€™m in the process of processing (ahemâ€¦) my experiences. Iâ€™ve experienced horrific and incredible things, all within my mind, that I never got the opportunity to fully express. I still feel timid but am getting better at expressing these things.

I believed that I was the victim of psychic attack and vampirism. I believed that there was a conspiracy against me. At the end of the day it was all true; the way it affected me on a visceral level is beyond belief.

I need to integrate the good stuff I learned about myself and throw out the bad.

I try to be a good friend, a good sister and a good person. I know I can be difficult and that my disorder is perhaps a reason for my loneliness.

But I never talk to any of them about it, I keep it to myself. I don't burden people with my problems, instead I try to be there for them. 

I'm tired of being lonely. And I can't talk about it 'cause all the advice I get are things I'm already trying to do.

"Trigger warning - suicide and abortion 
Sorry this might be a long one, just need to rant and find some understanding 

I've had a really crappy time over that last few months. I took an overdose this April and ended up in kidney failure. It tore me apart knowing that this absolutely destroyed my partner and I swore I'd never do it again.

A couple of weeks later, I found out I was pregnant. We disputed about what we should do and it led to my what I believe to be my first full manic episode. I almost ruined my relationship and scared the people around me. I woke up one day and it was like the fog had lifted and I was left with all the things I'd said and done. Ultimately, we decided to go through with the abortion.

Now, I feel like I have to hold myself together for a few reasons. I don't feel like i can trust anyone due to what happened during my manic episode, the delusions about my family were incredible and some of the things said to me I've not recovered from. I also feel like I can't let my partner down again after what happened with the kidney failure - I broke him. I am absolutely crushed about the abortion, the baby was wanted but it wasn't feasible right now. I can't even talk about it, it's so painful. And to top it off I've decided now is the right time to go back to work because I just can't cope with sitting around waiting for this next breakdown.

So much has happened these last few months that I feel like if I stop then I will explode. I have to hide how I'm feeling so I can be destructive without people knowing because it hurts them too much. I'm trying to press on but I'm falling apart on the inside and can't tell anyone. I just don't trust them with my feelings and I can't deal with hurting them anymore. I am resisting these urges but it's bloody difficult. I'm trying to be a better version of myself but I don't know how much of it is true. 

I think I just needed to get this out. Thank you.",bipolar_disorder

Sorry, I don't know shit about bipolar disorder and do not mean to hate, discriminate or hurt anyone with my ignorance.

"Ok, so I am bipolar 1 and have anxiety/OCD as well as PTSD. Do you think returning to floor nursing and being a local travel nurse ( so I can continue with my providers) would be a safe idea

Pros:
- The pay would get me out of debt and make amazing pay
- the ability to take long periods of time off every 12 weeks ( which might really help with bipolar)
-less chance to get involved in work drama
-the ability to choose my contracts

Cons:
- at one time I really liked my part-time desk nursing job that I have now, however they are no longer accomodating my disability.
-my current job is part-time which feels good for me or did at one point
- I worked at a shitty hospital that made floor nursing horrific, and I still get flashbacks from the abuse of managers (like I was literally getting SA from visitors and they told me it was part of the job)
-I get foggy brained from some of my meds and am afraid I'll be too dulled to be a floor nurse

"(21F) Iâ€™ve been taking Zoloft, Lamictal, and Vyvanse (only weekdays) for cyclothymia and adhd for about 2 years and Iâ€™ve recently noticed that my depressive episodes seem to be worse on the Zoloft. I had an issue with my prescription refills twice in the last 6 months that resulted in me not having any Zoloft for about a week each time and I felt better and more clear/lucid when I was off of it but started taking it again once the prescription was filled because I know Iâ€™m not a medical professional and shouldnâ€™t stop taking my meds without MP advisement. I noticed both times that I started taking it again that I immediately had depressive cycles that lasted at least a month (intermixed with some hypomanic periods).

I know SSRIs arenâ€™t recommended for mood disorders so Iâ€™m honestly not sure why Iâ€™m still on the Zoloft. I think the changing mood cycles could also just be a result of going off the med and back on in a short period of time but I just hate the way I feel in that period of time that I start it again.

"Itâ€™s hard for me to write about this because Iâ€™m trying to really streamline my thoughts and make as much sense as I can. 

I have had two full blown manic episodes in my life. Both were followed by periods of hypomania where Iâ€™d have periods of lucidity. 

In my full blown episodes, all names and words would become a pattern that my brain was trying to crack. It was like only I could make meaning of these patterns and names. I think this is possibly similar to how others experience manic episodes?

Anyway, being in public is hard for me sometimes. Because I start to relive those patterns or see them again. Iâ€™m totally lucid and stable on meds but Iâ€™ll hear someone call outâ€¦ say â€œEllaâ€ and my brain will rapid fire Cinderella/Ella Fitzgerald. If I was fully manic maybe Iâ€™d interpret that as I need to be treated like cinderella before I can make music like Ella Fitzgerald. Itâ€™s extremely triggering and then I gaslight myself into worrying that I really am slipping into mania even tho Iâ€™ve been stable for 3+ years. Itâ€™s so hard to be in public spaces with a lot of noise or seeing people with nonverbal tics because it reminds me of mania. 

I know there isnâ€™t some grandiose scheme or entity behind these patterns my brain makes because theyâ€™re just coincidences or reminders but it gets overwhelming tuning them out.

Because of this, I quickly fell into a rage with screaming that shortly transitioned to despair and sobbing. I started to think that nobody loves me, I am worthless, and that I am a terrible human being undeserving of love.

I donâ€™t have any â€œemergencyâ€ meds for manic episodes anymore since itâ€™s been so long. My brother (doctor) recommended I just take my Latuda early and see if it knocks me out.

Felt fine this morning and now my brain is starting to feel all jumbled again and I cannot stop SHAKING. Like is this a thing? And Iâ€™m super irritable. Just can anyone tell me is this is potentially an episode and tell me what to do? I already gave my credit card to my brother. I havenâ€™t told my mom because she definitely canâ€™t deal.

"As a disclaimer, I was diagnosed at 29 with bipolar 1 disorder after a voluntary stay at a mental health facility. That was a little over two years ago. 

In order to be released back into the wild, I had to create a safety plan and such, and have â€œaccountability peopleâ€ to help me follow through with monthly visits with my psychologist and visits with a therapist.

I 100% want to be well (although I do miss the mania) and do not disagree that I have a mental disorder. For that reason, I have never missed a visit with my psychologist and have never gone more than a few random days without taking my meds.

My first real experience with the mental health system was at age 29, two years ago. Since then, Iâ€™ve had three therapists. I want to be in therapy because itâ€™s something I promised my family I would do, but to me, it seems absolutely pointless.

My first female therapist would just listen and never gave any sort of feedback. I discontinued seeing her after about 3 months and then waited a while before going again. My second female therapist seemed ok, but our relationship was cut short due to insurance issues, and my third therapist is a male and I had been seeing him for about 4 months. 

He is a great person who is very easy to talk to. He is very encouraging and affirming, but to me, I did not find a single session helpful or useful. Not the sharing, not the caring, and definitely not the advice. It all just seems like a weird act to me. I was very open and honest and tried to give it a fair shot, but does sharing your problems really even begin to solve them? I guess thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m struggling. 

Every hour visit is a $60 co-pay, and I was having virtual visits once a week, which really adds up. Aside from the cost, it also was not useful to me whatsoever. This past week, I canceled my scheduled visits and discontinued seeking therapy. 

Am I missing something or is there *something* I should be specifically looking to get out of therapy? Has therapy worked for you guys, or do you find it to be a cringeworthy act like I do?",bipolar_disorder

"I got diagnosed at 23, after a months-long manic episode that caused my life to combust in spectacular fashion. Before and after that, I spent 8 years in total as an alcoholic with other tangential drug problems, having dozens of hospital visits for both my addiction issues and mental health. My early twenties were a complete disaster, with me always wondering why I was so up and down, why one moment I'd be incredibly motivated and high-functioning, and then all of a sudden I would start to crash and burn. Spent the last two years first in a borderline psychotic haze as I tried a bunch of different meds that mostly fucked me up, and the last year in a deep depression as my drinking got worse, and worse, and worse.

The first few months of this year were terrible, and I started ultra rapid cycling. I had a period of about two weeks where I had a hypomanic episode and started slamming back more than a litre of vodka a day. I think it was a combination of hitting that point (I got very, very sick), as well as finally hitting a therapeutic dose of my meds (thank you Lamotrigine you fucking champion) that seemed to change my mindset.

Decided to stop numbing myself and running away from my problems. I created a routine that I started sticking to religiously, exercising regularly, completely changed my diet. Trying to move forward in my life. 4 months later, I have a well paying, full time job after 2 years of not working. I've moved out of my house for the first time, I got my driver's license (finally). I'm 118 days sober (the longest I've been sober for 10 years). I have a group of incredibly awesome friends that are super supportive about both my mental illness and my sobriety. Started going to therapy for the first time which is helping immensely. I've lost almost 25 kgs, and I'm going to the gym 5-6 days a week.

I know that it's something I've got to work at to maintain, and that I need to keep moving forward and making progress at. I set further goals that I work to achieve, and I've started putting earnest effort into accomplishing them.

I found that the things that were most helpful were the meds (clearly), deciding to face my problems head on and get all the help that I could, and finally, breaking things down into the smallest possible things that I could. I'd always set goals with a huge scope, with a massive threshold for something that I could consider as an achievement, and then I'd get depressed and demotivated when I couldn't accomplish them straight away, burn out, and just completely return to my old habits. This time I decided to do it differently. Breaking things down into their smallest components gave me a sense of achievement that made it so much easier to keep going. My goal of initially losing 20kg became losing 1 kg in two weeks. Getting a job became looking at listings for 5 minutes. Getting fit became going for a walk for 20 minutes a day. Forming meaningful relationships became chatting to someone for 5-10 minutes. Things became simpler and easier.

I know that everyone's struggle is different, some things are easier, and some are harder. But I just wanted to share what happened to me, partly because I am incredibly proud of myself and what I've managed to accomplish, but also to possibly help others in situations like mine know that there can be good things that come out of complete disasters.

Thank for reading and I really hope that this didn't come off too badly, but I've just really wanted to share this for a long time with a community that would understand how hard it was to get to this point.",bipolar_disorder

You look around but the room is spinning. 

You focus in on a mirror but the person in the reflection is unfamiliar. 

Tunnel vision makes it hard to see anything other than whatâ€™s right in front of you, but thatâ€™s what youâ€™re trying to avoid seeing. 

A smell in the air reminds you of home, but this room doesnâ€™t feel like the home you remember. 

You hear a voice in the distance but you donâ€™t know where itâ€™s coming from. 

The voice is familiar, but not welcome. 

This vital force is feral and unhinged, yet youâ€™re drawn closer to it, enchanted by promises of joy on the other side. 

You feel this urge to follow this voice yet you know it can only bring you harm. 

You close your eyes and begin to picture an illustration. 

As each line is drawn onto the paper, the graphite begins to create an image. 

Line after line, day after day, it seems unending. 

It feels like this image youâ€™ve been dreaming of will never come to fruition. 

Your chest feels tight, heart heavy
Anxiety spreads as your body fills with dread. 

Your hands tingle and shake as you wipe the tears from your eyes. 

The daunting voice grows louder and you cover your ears in hopes of finding one moment of peace. 

You feel a heightened level of desperation for some sense of normalcy. 

The lines in your photograph seem to go off track, not making any sense as your instability shows on the paper. 

The image you once dreamed of is becoming blurred, losing sight of the beauty you once saw. 

Day after day the lines begin to all look the same and it feels like youâ€™re getting nowhere on this journey. 

The room still spinning as you begin to lose your footing and fall to the ground. 

Your knees hit the earth beneath you and the ground begins to shake. 

The floor crumbles around you and you grasp on to any debris that could possibly stop you from falling into the abyss below. 

Fingers holding the weight of everything you carry begin to slip off the edge. 

Youâ€™re narrowly hanging on to reality as you desperately try to pull yourself back up into stability.

You hang on for what feels like a lifetime, but canâ€™t seem to pull yourself back up. 

You realize youâ€™ve been clutching on for so long, you donâ€™t know how much longer you can hold a grip. 

You want anything in the world other than to take this plunge, but your grasp is diminishing. 

The voice calls you to the bottom as your final finger slips from the edge. 

You close your eyes as you plummet to a seemingly endless bottom. 

You awaken in the same room you had just fallen from. 

The familiar space brings peace yet youâ€™re overwhelmed with anguish because you know that this room brings no true comfort.

No matter how much you try, your strength only carries you so far. 
Reality fading away and setting in at the same time. 

Perhaps itâ€™s too familiar.

With really deep digging, I responded to the questions which might indicate that I am. However, I still donâ€™t know, and Iâ€™m worried I was pressured into it.

then about a week ago i learned my lease ends on the 31st of august this year instead of 2 years from now like i was told when i signed. looked for a place for a couple days but decided i shouldnt stress too hard as i can move back in with my mom. i still burned out. had an emotional breakdown talking to my girlfriend over the phone then hung up and proceeded to cry hard for 1.5 hours. stress from dissatisfaction at work and having to move, feeling like ill never be consistent, always a sufferer of mental illness. i was bed ridden for a couple days and told my work im unavailable indefinitely. i realized that id be happier finishing highschool and going on and getting a less stressful job with a degree like a librarian for instance. then i got interested into film direction again and am considering making some projects. feeling better about what i want to do, i spent time with my girlfriend and told her about my desire to go to school and pursue film direction maybe.

today im talking with my girlfriend (who has tried to support me through this) over the phone after hanging out yesterday. im talking about the downsides of moving back in with my mom, i have to sleep on the floor of a shared room with either my mom or my brothers (who stay up all night playing their computers). my moms room is small but seems to be the better option. my girlfriend hangs up. i call her back and she essentially tells me that im too stressful, inconsistent, and emotional for her. that im confused about life and we are different. she doesnt want to talk to me anymore. she has really bad anxiety so i understand that confiding in her stresses her out. i dont know whats gonna happen between us yet.

i hope i can see highschool through, its been years since i tried and failed. i hope i can get along with my brothers, because theyre the reason i moved out in the first place (cant sleep peacefully or at reasonable times in their presence)

i just had to vent. im gonna recite this to my counsellor tomorrow who i only see once a month.

Bipolar 1 here. Highly functional with my career as an RN. Just switched to nights so I can actually breathe at work...but I'm having trouble sleeping.

"Has your psychiatrist, GP or therapist ever said anything to you about your Bipolar that freaked you right out?    


Once my GP said to me, ""You have a family and job.  I am really worried that soon you won't have either.""  It doesn't sound so bad, but my GP and I are pretty close (as close as you can be in a totally appropriate patient/doctor way) because we both work in an area with a lot of crime and poverty.  The way he said it made me realize that he sincerely thought that I might go from a typical boring person living their life to living on the street lost in psychosis, and that definitely freaked me out.",bipolar_disorder

"Hi everyone. Iâ€™ve struggled with bipolar as long as I can remember. Iâ€™m a 27 yr old female. I had attendance issues in middle and high school and at every job since. This one Iâ€™m at now is my longest stint at a job at 16 months. My direct manager doesnâ€™t understand and is reasonably angry with me for missing so frequently. I totally understand his frustration but some days I canâ€™t help it. Iâ€™ll stay in bed for days. I also have really bad anxiety untreated. Iâ€™m on 2 meds for my bipolar/depression. 

I have manic episodes where I will be the absolute best employee and so friendly and talkative, more so than normal. Some days I wake up and can just feel that I just canâ€™t do the day. Then once I miss a day I know I let everyone down and my anxiety gets the best of me and itâ€™s a really bad snowball effect. Iâ€™ll be too embarrassed to go back and have questions asked and so Iâ€™ll call in again and it just snowballs out of control to the point where itâ€™s way too humiliating to go back so I just stop going altogether. Itâ€™s bad. Iâ€™m so sad and mad at myself, why canâ€™t I be normal? Everyone else can show up for work even if theyâ€™re feeling like shit why canâ€™t I do something so basic? ðŸ˜”",bipolar_disorder

Spent the last five months taking my meds every day, trying to sleep at least seven hours a night, tracking my moods/sleep/meds/stressors on Daylio and eMoods, etc. All of this helped me.

I got my performance evaluation at work today. And I was not pleased. I was rated ""average"" on virtually everything. I'm highly pissed. 

This illness has taken so much from me. I'm done. I'm busting my ass off, and they're telling me I'm ""average?"" I didn't work to the core and rake and scrape to get what I've got just to be told I'm fucking average! It's ridiculous. I'm done.",bipolar_disorder

I was diagnosed with MDD and PTSD at 14 after a psych hospitalization and have been medicated since. I had a really rough 4 years and finally got off my meds (it was court ordered i stay on meds when I was younger) and lasted about 3 months or so until I was yet again hospitalized and put in in-patient. 

Iâ€™m now on lamotrigine and duloxetine.  I was doing great once I got on it but after a couple months they upped the duloxetine and I had a bit of an episode where I posed danger to myself out of impulse, which my psychiatrist thought was of great concern. She asked a lot of questions regarding hypomanic and manic symptoms. 

I had a much more identifiable episode that my therapist and i theorized to be anxiety but definitely fits into the criteria for hypomania, which my psychiatrist acknowledged. She also gave me a bipolar monthly mood tracking chart (https://bipolarnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/MonthlyMoodChart.pdf)
Which I think is concerning, I have been reluctant to the idea of having a mood disorder and have been very anxious about the possibility. Now Iâ€™m ambivalent as I spend time researching the disorders.

Nothing really changed thatd have me feeling happy at all. It was basically a complete turn around out of nowhere. Most of the things id usually worry or obsess over i found super easy to just discard and worry about another time and even after having a string of terrible luck this past week that wouldve sent me down a spiral not long ago ive been able to smile through it and ignore it.

Whenever I am in a depression relapse or am going towards one I always become so desperate in a way. Itâ€™s like I crave the attention and company of the guys I have a crush on or am attracted to. Itâ€™s like I need to be around them. I guess it makes sense. They make me feel happy and giddy and sexy and confident. So I guess it makes sense that when Iâ€™m near a depression relapse or in one Iâ€™d crave these peoples company and attention as they provide me with some momentary happiness. But that doesnâ€™t make it any easier. Itâ€™s quite frustrating to crave their attention and company during or near a depression relapse because if I donâ€™t get it then I feel worse. And it feels like Iâ€™m relying on someone else for my happiness. That habit took me years to break. It took me years to rely on myself and be independent rather than wait for a â€œknight in shining armorâ€.

"So I live in Massachusetts, and have had SSDI for a few years and understand that system, I don't need tips on that right now. I have a friend who is trying to help her brother in Maine, he's bipolar and an alcoholic, with liver and kidney issues from the drinking. My issue is there seems to be a lot less other resources in Maine than Massachusetts. We have a state program called EAEDC (emergency aid for the elderly, and disabled, and children) that provides food stamps and minimal financial assistance, usually about $300 for a single adult with no kids, during the time it takes to apply for SSDI. I've researched it all morning and can't find anything similar. TANF/TAFDC won't work because he doesn't have children. have you heard of anything like EAEDC, maybe under a different name?

Also my SSDI application was greatly helped and also accelerated by the fact that I was already deemed disabled by my bipolar and PTSD by the Massachusetts department of mental health, which was a much shorter application and only took about a month to become a client. It allows access to a lot more mental health services, like home visitors and peer mentors for you and possibly family. I believe in Maine it's called the department of behavioral health.

At the same time they have such a big heart and would do anything for me. Theyâ€™re fun and are super compassionate. Being around them can be difficult sometimes but I feel like they really understand me and are patient with my mental problems.

Iâ€™ve been wanting to leave, but in this and every relationship Iâ€™ve been in Iâ€™m always the one to end things - whether itâ€™s because Iâ€™m not sexually satisfied, our long term wants arenâ€™t the same, whatever. 

But whenever I get close to actually doing it I have a moment where I wonder if itâ€™s because Iâ€™m bipolar and my illness is causing me to self sabotage. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m dealing with right now. Am I going to regret this because Iâ€™m just being crazy? Or am I going to embrace the change and start to be my old self again (in a good way)?

"I am in the process of getting real help with my ""issues"". Those being my inability to focus, racing thoughts, never being able to calm my brain down, severe, obsessive paranoid episodes, depressive episodes, and just a lot of general anxiety. I had a psychological assessment recently and started with a new therapist. I haven't gotten the ""official"" results of the assessment but the psychiatrist I worked with during the process suspected bipolar II. My grandmother had bipolar I and she was completely unable to function for the later part of her life. I am functional, in fact, I have a degree in math and work full time. I do feel like getting my degree was a lot harder for me than my peers. Not because the subject material is too hard but because I have a poor memory, can't focus for long periods of time, and can be pretty impulsive sometimes. I relied a lot on my natural abilities to get through college, rather than studying. 

Now, my issues have gotten more severe and I'm less able to focus, my ""anxiety"" is more extreme, and I will go from overactive hyper to sobbing depressed in a matter of a couple of days. I've started talking about these things with my family members because they're so bad now. However, I haven't historically expressed a lot of this. So now my family and friends don't understand or feel as though my issues are as bad as I feel they are. My mom says she is bewildered by recent events and she can't understand how things went wrong so quickly. I feel like things have always been not quite right. I can't tell if they're remembering the past with rose colored glasses or if I'm seeing it worse than it was. It makes me feel like I'm totally fine and just overreacting to the situation. One friend in particular told me she hasn't noticed any of this in me, and then it's like, okay, am I just being dramatic???? It also makes me wanna never talk to her again. I don't know why, I don't think its an unreasonable statement, but it just makes me want to drop her from my life. We've been friends for nearly 10 years.

He sees me manic, the irritability, the stress, late nights etc. And he sees the depressive episodes, sleeping for 14-16 hours, overeating, not talking.   


Does anyone else worry about this and what advice do you have on how to manage the expectations I guess. I am fully open with being honest with him when he can understand as it's only fair for him to know about the twin thing as well as why daddy is a little different to mummy and other daddies.

"I graduated college in the class of 2021 and started my first engineering job last August. At the time I was undiagnosed and thought I was relatively normal. However, about 5 - 6 months into the job I started becoming extremely manic and I also started smoking an insane amount of Marijuana every day, and it led to me getting really bad psychosis. This culminated with me putting up a BLM sign at my desk at work, and then having an HR meeting where I accused a bunch of my coworkers (including my boss) of being Nazis who were plotting to kill me. 

Shortly after I even called my parents and accused them of trying to kill me as well, and threatened to commit suicide, so they called 911 and I ended up in a psych ward. 

As of now I'm technically on an unpaid medical leave of absence from work, and in order to return to work I have to have my doctor fill out a ""fitness for duty"" certification. 

I want to go back to work and start getting my career back on track, as well as keep my insurance, but I'm extremely worried about going back. The first issue is the shear embarrassment of going back there after everything that transpired; I feel like I will be a pariah and tainted around the office and viewed as a total psycho crazy person. I'm also extremely worried about them firing me shortly after I return.

 Another issue is that I've noticed that they have posted my job on Indeed, so clearly they are interviewing other people to potentially replace me.

"Diagnosed w bipolar at 19, Iâ€™m 20 now.

I started self harming since 13 but every once in a while (before my diagnosis) if I take too long of a break with self harm, my mind gets uncomfortable and I feel the need to go a lot deeper than normal, and idk how Iâ€™d explain it to a therapist aside from â€œIâ€™m just checking to see if Iâ€™m still realâ€. 

Like still a person. And idk what Iâ€™d be other than a person, but I worry about robots and AI and my consciousness being put into a fake robot body that looks like mine after suicide attempts. (I know Iâ€™m not important enough for that tho and realistically the government would probably be involved so that helps the delusion calm down a good bit)

Recently Iâ€™ve been slightly uncomfortable w others cause I donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re real or human. Wtf, I know. I donâ€™t tell ppl this, itâ€™s just an internal anxiety thatâ€™s been pretty heavy lately.


Taking pictures of my past self harm can help calm me later w the specific â€œrobot-humanâ€ delusion but itâ€™s triggering at the same time so I donâ€™t have many coping skills w this, and I havenâ€™t self harmed in months so Iâ€™m really going up the wall. :(

I know this is the most bizarre thing but Iâ€™ve struggled w robots since I was a kid and when Iâ€™m manic itâ€™s so easy for me to slip back into that thinking where Iâ€™m the only â€œactualâ€ real human and everyone else is â€œfakeâ€, or that Iâ€™m also â€œfakeâ€ and I need to check that Iâ€™m real.

Idk this is a big rant and Iâ€™ve been dealing w this for a while- Therapy appointment in two weeks, hoping for some help cause my intrusive thoughts about how I need to â€œproveâ€ to myself Iâ€™m real are getting worse and more graphic.

"I am currently in a situation where I have not been able to get hired by any employer in my area for over an entire year, and I am stuck living at home with my family. I have received numerous calls and offers from various universities and my parents are so desperate for me to do anything with my life that they will pay tuition for me if I decide to go. I really do want a higher education while I'm still young, but I have a lot of concerns about going. I want to know if dorm life is even possible with my condition, as I am quite literally unable to function with people nearby because of anxiety. Quite simply, it makes me unable to use the bathroom or think clearly and I get panic attacks. Mood swings usually make it worse, and also add a nice touch of anger to it. I know there are accommodations for people like me, but I don't know how difficult it is to get them. I also don't know that I would even be able to finish college, as when I was in high school, my mood swings made me stop caring about the work altogether and I eventually dropped out because I hated it so much. I surely don't want to work minimum wage jobs my entire life or be on disability benefits, and I wouldn't be in debt if I went, but I'm really not sure that I could even do it. What if I can't find a job afterwards even with a degree? If low-skill jobs won't even hire me, then how can I be assured that more specialized jobs will?

"I (29F) am totally manic right now and Iâ€™ll explain why I think so. This might be long but thereâ€™s a TLDR at the bottom. 

I just wanted to share my experience with mania and seek out assurance that Iâ€™m not the only one who does stupid sh*t like this when theyâ€™re manic. This is possibly dangerous behavior at worst and reckless at best

I recently quit my job and one of my old bosses (54M) who I was so far below him in position, reached out to me. We started a relationship and he confessed he was attracted to me when he first saw me (months prior) during my interview for another position. Is that.. strange? Regardless, before we were intimate he told me he was in a â€œcomplicated marriageâ€, when I asked if his wife knew he met me/was talking to me/knew about me and he pretty much brushed me off with vague answers like â€œnot directly to you. We donâ€™t speak directly about it. She knows weâ€™re only together for our childâ€ etc.,

This isnâ€™t the first time a married man threw himself at me but the most extreme scenario. As a matter of fact I have multiple married men who want to hang out with meâ€¦ of course I say â€œnoâ€ 99% of the time. This time I didnâ€™t though. First it was cheating boyfriends now itâ€™s married men, I never intend for this to happen, they all pretty much lie to me that theyâ€™re single and I have to find out otherwise. Except for one time, when a (34M) in an ethically non-monogamous relationship started a relationship with me. His wife inevitably scared me off by telling me what a horrible husband he was and how he used to cheat on her when they were serious. She literally said she wasnâ€™t in love with him. 

These situations are just so horrible but I continue because I enjoy it even though itâ€™s risquÃ© behavior. I donâ€™t know why I enjoy it, my judgement is probably highly impaired ATM or I might be addicted to sex or intimacy. 

I feel like men just see me as a tool for their character development because Iâ€™m â€œattractiveâ€, â€œeccentricâ€ and â€œmysteriousâ€ but I also feel like I see men asâ€¦ something that would make me sound like a horrible person to say (I see men as FUN). Understand I donâ€™t always think like this just when Iâ€™m manic and hyper-sexual but my feelings arenâ€™t currently invested in these relationships Iâ€™m juggling around. I just get so carried away in the moment, you know? When my mania ends I know I will push most of these people away from me. 

-TLDR-
I have so many men flirting with due to working in the same field (proximity) and because Iâ€™m a new face (curiosity). Or maybe my ego is just too big for my own good? I know when Iâ€™m depressed Iâ€™ll agree with that statement but Iâ€™m tired of having relationships with people I feel nothing for (just chasing that high of intimacy) especially when they turn out to be horrible boyfriends/husbands using me to live out some little fantasy they all got. 

I donâ€™t treat these relationships as theyâ€™re serious.

I also practice safe sex even though many of these guys try to get away without it.

"A year and a half ago, a guy tried to take advantage of me. I was drunk in a bar, and he got me a water. Thirty minutes later, I was unable to walk or move. When getting escorted back to my room, he tried to stay with me, but another guy prevented him from doing so. Iâ€™m pretty sure he roofied me. Iâ€™ve always known what his intentions were, but Iâ€™m not turned off by what he did. 

If anything, I have feelings for him. No other guy has liked me that way before. Maybe there have been other guys who liked me, but none have ever been so overt about their interest in me. Weâ€™re still social media friends, and my hope is that we can get married and live happily ever after together. Another thing that didnâ€™t help was that at the same time, a guy that I really liked had a girlfriend. He kept the fact that he had a girlfriend from me, and I was so disappointed. So I redirected my feelings for my crush onto this other guy

I know itâ€™ll be rough. Given how confident he was with me, he likely has done what he did to me before. I admit, Iâ€™m a virgin, never had a boyfriend before either. I want to have sex so bad. I know heâ€™ll likely hurt me really bad, but he said that Iâ€™m the most beautiful girl heâ€™s ever seen. He told mutual friends this. I want to get married to him and be financially dependent on him. I want to be pregnant with his children, and have lots of babies with him. Knowing what I know about him, he has some abusive tendencies, but not to worry. I wonâ€™t let him hurt our babies. Iâ€™ll redirect his anger and frustrations on me. No one has ever loved me before, and heâ€™s the best I can do. I donâ€™t want anyone else, just him.",bipolar_disorder

It makes me feel misrepresented and belittled. Honestly it makes it more worthwhile to not talk about my bipolar a lot of the time. That way I at least avoid the stigma. 

Like Iâ€™m out here going totally broke and going to jail and shit, meanwhile I have acquaintances telling me about their tragic manic episodes involving dyeing their hair green. I just canâ€™t. There is no bridging that gap.

"Iâ€™ve been on lamotrigine for almost a full year and itâ€™s made me constantly hypomanic and a total space cadet. When I started taking it, I didnâ€™t sleep more than four hours a night for six months. At the therapudic dose, I get severe shaking, palpitations and panic attacks. When I combine it with seroquel to tone down the mania I end up sobbing on the floor every day. Other antipsychotics had awful side effects. Iâ€™m now back on a lower dose of lamotrigine and I have maybe three days of stability a month. 

This constant hypomania is EXHAUSTING and I hate it. Itâ€™s made me burn bridges, put jobs at risk, and made me socially weird. On top of that, it makes me so forgetful and spacey. I stutter, I forget names, I almost missed a flight to New York because I just forgot about my trip completely. Plus, all my other emotions are completely erased and my thoughts are fuzzy. Thereâ€™s only hypomania, hardly any me.

I had explained this to my psych, who thought I was lying to get off meds. I would love to find meds that work, but hypomanic me quit the job that gave me insurance and I canâ€™t see a psych for the time being.

I want meds so I can feel like me. I want meds so I can work a job and focus on my career. I want meds so I can live a full life. 

Before meds, I had episodes but at least I could keep appointments, held down jobs for years at a time, and was well-spoken and composed.

It seems like if I want to get a job with insurance to solve this problem, I have to go with what I know. I would not stop cold turkey and would taper my doses over weeks. But I am not myself on these meds. This constant hypomania is really holding me back.",bipolar_disorder
"Long story so apologies in advance.

I had a pretty difficult childhood- grew up in a cult and had an emotionally abusive step dad, so Iâ€™ve always chalked up my issues to childhood traumas. I started noticing more of my moods during my teenage years. Around 15-17 I dated my first boyfriend and if Iâ€™m honest I know I was the cause of our breakup. We had a routine of talking for hours every day on the phone and some nights I picked fights while other nights I would just cry and when he would ask why I didnâ€™t have a good answer. I just knew I felt a LOT. Eventually he got tired of the upâ€™s and downs and we broke up. That hit me hard- I went into my first ever depression at the age of 17 and it lasted over 6 months. I was truly wrecked and felt utterly hopeless. 

The next few relationships in my life followed a similar pattern. I would typically feel great at the beginning of a new relationship and before long I would start focusing on random things and blowing small issues into huge problems. I would go zero to a hundred real quick, and many times I would storm off, slam doors, threaten to breakup with them, sometimes even actually breakup- all to wake up the next day or the day after and feel shame and remorse. I would apologize and feel like a terrible person. I met my now husband in 2018 and he let me know early on he was not playing these games with me. So Finally in 2019 I started attending therapy, with the purpose of being a better and less reactive partner. The waves of depression still came and went during all these years, but I would call them â€œfunksâ€ because most listed a couple of weeks to a month or two max. I really didnâ€™t even identify what was going on as depression. My therapist helped me work on a lot of issues through trauma therapy- EMDR, hypnosis, etc. He never mentioned he suspected bipolar in our 7 months working together. 

Right before the pandemic I went to see a psychiatrist. I went with an agenda- I wanted adderall because I noticed attention deficit problems in myself and the one time I had taken one before I felt euphoric and hyper focused. I thought it was awesome. (I realize thatâ€™s a sign of mania but itâ€™s medically induced so doesnâ€™t count?) anyway, this psychiatrist told me he would NOT be prescribing the adderall because he thought I was bipolar, and proceeded to give me mood stabilizers. I left this appointment very upset and felt extremely dismissed. I felt like the guy spoke to me for 5 mins and decided he knew me better than I knew myself and even said how irresponsible it was for him to be sending me home with these pills. I never took them. Fast forward to a month ago- I started a new job and felt very overwhelmed and stressed, and within a few weeks I found myself in a very dark place. I knew I was extremely depressed so with the encouragement of friends and my husband I saw a therapist, who referred me to a psychiatrist again. This time it was someone who took the time to listen and ask lots of questions. And she too diagnosed me with bipolar type 2. I am now taking Lamictal and Seroquel. 

I guess my issue with the diagnosis is my hypomania is not like the one Iâ€™ve seen documented on YouTube or described in many blogs. Yes, I experience periods of intense productivity and feeling great. Yes, I do suffer from periods of insomnia that usually last for 7-14 days at a time, but I donâ€™t actually feel amazing while not sleeping. I just feel tired and I know deep down I need to rest. My body can feel it. My lows also arenâ€™t so bad that I become suicidal. I too Zoloft once years ago and had to get off it asap because it made me very suicidal- that was the one and only time Iâ€™ve felt that way. Maybe I exaggerated my symptoms to the doctor? Maybe theyâ€™re worn? am I taking these meds for no reason? I just donâ€™t FEEL bipolar. I feel misunderstood. 

TLDR: childhood trauma makes me feel like my issues are not bipolar, but rather just things I need to work though and I donâ€™t meet the criteria for BP 2. Questioning if I even am?",bipolar_disorder

"Hi fam! Canâ€™t same Iâ€™m thrilled to be here, but super grateful that this space exists. This is likely going to be all over the place, so bear with me. Long story short, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder over a year ago, have avoided medication this entire time, and it has been a journey (im 25). For starters, the psychiatristsâ€” I swear they actually enjoy making my life hell. The horror stories I have. Anybody else?? And I have literally been diagnosed as BP1, BP1 with psychotic features, and BP2 and idk what Iâ€™m supposed to do with that. 

Anywho, Iâ€™ve been incredibly hesitant to start medication. Partly because of acceptance and also because Iâ€™m super sensitive and side effects terrify me. However things have just gotten so bad and no matter how many times I promise myself Iâ€™ll â€œbe strongerâ€ or Iâ€™ll â€œdo betterâ€ I wind up unable to get out of bed or frantically sprinting outside at night while crying trying to figure out how to get rid of this miserable energy or whatâ€™s happening to me. So, Iâ€™ve accepted meds might be a necessity. Iâ€™m leaning towards lamictal, but my psychiatrist is thinking geodon. Any thoughts or favorites? I have a terrible past with eating disorders so avoiding weight gain is super important to me. Any recs? Thanks to whoever made it this far. Itâ€™s long-winded because Iâ€™ve got a lot on my mind and really no one to tell it to. Outside of doctors, only my parents and my best friend know. Im terrified, because Iâ€™m new to the mental health space in general. Prior to this I hadnâ€™t even been diagnosed with anxiety or depression. But all of your posts encourage me. Good luck to all of us, and donâ€™t give up. Thank you in advance!

During my stint in the Kaiser Chinatown facility, I asked the orderlies if they were familiar with the parable of Archimedes. I suppose that may have seemed an off the wall though analogy seemed the only way to convey the profound injustice at hand. They ignored the wishes of my wife and lied. It is not right to ignore the wishes of the loved ones of those in that situation. 

The great mathematician Archimedes was murdered by accident by Roman soldiers who took umbrage at how he ignored their commands, preferring to focus instead on solving geometric problems by drawing circles in the sand. Upon hearing of this tragedy, the Roman general ordered decimation, the systematic elimination of ten percent of the soldierâ€™s legion. 

Perhaps a similar principle could be applied to the psychiatric profession. No, not literal decimation :P But given the number of stories of harm inflicted by ostensible medical caregivers and my personal lived experience, I canâ€™t help but ask: does the modern psychiatric establishment truly adhere to the basic principle of â€œfirm do no harm?â€ Itâ€™s at the very least an open question.

"By ""relationships"", I mean the broadest sense of the word - family, friends, SO's, coworkers, neighbors, etc.

The best way I found to describe it is that I have no object permanence when it comes to how I see other people. It always reverts back to a negative, angry, judgmental, and mean version of them, totally distorted and usually without any real evidence that they would be that way. That turns into feeling like I believe a conspiracy theory about everyone hating me.

This is the worst I've had it so far, and I'm worried I lost the last person just now. I haven't talked to my sister in a week and talk as little as possible to my parents but pretend I'm fine, and I just felt that coldness towards my significant other.

I'm 19, diagnosed while 19, and have so far been hospitalized twice, both times leading to a psych ward stay. My first stay was 4 days, my second stay was a week because they were both short-term facilities mostly for suicidal ideation and attempts.",bipolar_disorder

My question is, does haldol really work for agitation and anxiety?

I've been more upset during the day lately and sometimes I take my haldol as a PRN, so an extra 4mg, but I'm not sure I notice any effects.

"Ever since I (20) started having mental health issues it seems like my parents have wanted me to get off of medications. They see them as â€œweakâ€ and just talk about the side effects but they actually help me. I think my dad is doing it so that eventually he can force me into the military but fuck that.

They have a relationship with my therapist who had me sign some forms so he could â€œget information from themâ€ which made me think that he tells them everything (they are patients of his) so I donâ€™t really tell him shit I just go through the motions in my sessions. He also is pushing against medication.

I have just resorted to going back to lying about what medications Iâ€™m on so they will get off my back. I am also seeing another therapist soon and going to break off my current one which I am sure will lead to a whole argument.

It feels like my parents are just waiting for me to â€œget betterâ€ like I have a head cold or something. Iâ€™m already doing my best and personally donâ€™t have anything against medications so I guess itâ€™s time to leave them all in the darkâ€¦just like how things used to be.",bipolar_disorder
"  

I've never been suicidal before so I'm not entirely sure what it means. I don't plan to kill myself. It's never really been an option for me, not have I wanted to.

My son acquired guns. A glock and an AR shotgun of some sort. I don't know much about guns. But, I know he's so very very ill and unmedicated that the guns are an issue. I spent an hour on the phone with the police last night trying to determine if/when they need to intervene. 

I don't want to remove his rights to bear arms. He is very paranoid and is convinced people are trying to kill him. He needs home protection. Hey, a lot of people have guns for that very reason and I understand. I'm not a gun person. I once had a gun. A sig p229. My boyfriend pointed it at my pregnant tummy. That all ended badly. 

Now my sweet little boy is fucked in the head. I bought him a new phone and the purchase made him think I'm trying to kill him. Non-stop emailing for days. I'm a ho, I'm a bitch, I'm trying to kill him.

I lock my doors but he could easily get me through the window at night. He hasn't threatened to do that yet so that helps.

He hates his little brother - he knows where the elementary school is. The police say it's alarming but since there have been no direct threats and the law is not being broken, there isn't anything they can do.

I don't want this to be my life. 

It occurred to me today while pulling into the garage after work that I could close the door, roll down my windows, listen to the radio and never have to deal with this shit again.

It would be sad for my little one but he's got a dad and would be fine. My mom would be sad but whatever.

I'm not saying it's my plan but I can feel that it is a way out. Iâ€™ve never felt like this before. 

Done. Worn out. Truly void of emotion. I canâ€™t cry. I canâ€™t do anything. What am I? Just a person. I don't have to keep doing this. 

Today my daffodils bloomed so I will stick around for that.

"long story short i took an edible for my birthday last year and woke up manic/psychotic the next day. episode lasted for 3 months and i was slapped with the bipolar I diagnosis. some pros think i had laced weed and/or it was a substance-induced mood disorder, others think itâ€™s straight up bipolar disorder. 

i pretty much worry about whether or not i have true bipolar disorder or not daily. iâ€™ve never had any other manic episodes in the past, even on SSRIs. iâ€™m on abilify and wellbutrin now and donâ€™t experience any symptoms either.

So i met with my new psychiatrist today. She was super nice and really listened to me. Even changed up my diagnosis after reading my chart and talking with me.

"Hello. Sorry if this isn't the right place for this, I'm not sure where else to go. 


I am severely bipolar w/ psychotic features and rapid cycling. Meds (particularly vraylar and lamictal) have done a lot for me in terms of management. However I still get extreme depressive lows. My significant other works from home and we are both about to go to graduate school in the fall. We also have cats.

All this background to say: I want a dog. 

I have talked to my therapist about this and she agrees a dog would help me get out of the house, which is a big thing for me since I'm very isolated and lonely. I have no friends and I would benefit greatly from the company and companionship a dog could provide. Plus a dog could give me the will to live and get out of bed during those lows. My therapist even suggested a service dog. 

I've told all this to my significant other but they do not want a dog and say they're worried that we cant handle a dog and we will have to rehome it. They get very upset when we talk about it and say they feel like a horrible person for not letting me get something I potentially need. I just wish they were excited about it like I am. 

Am I the asshole for pushing the issue? I keep bringing up getting a dog because it's so important for me.

Anyone have any insight? Does anyone here have dogs? How do your dogs help/not help you? I'm at a loss for what to do and I want to stop sleeping all day while my significant other works. I want something to live for.",bipolar_disorder

"Because my GP and psychiatrist were asking if I had episodes where I was feeling hyper and I associated that word with being super energetic AND happy. 

At times, I am. But it was rare. And I guess they had a hard time diagnosing me since the result did not match for a bipolar disorder with manic episodes? Idk. 

BUT there were times that I don't have anything to do and I feel super bored. It comes to a point that I was really irritable because I'm bored but I don't want to do anything since I am uninterested with my hobbies. Then I would feel crazy because I want to do something drastic but I don't know what! 

(Btw, I'm not on any medications and am not regularly seeing a psychiatrist because I live in a 3rd world country with mental health stigma and affording treatment is expensive.)

Then this is where it becomes more dangerous. I would feel left out, and that no one is there to help me and understand me. I mean, I was trying to cope up by myself cause I want to be better. But sometimes I can't do it alone and I'll realize no one is there for me. I'll be overwhelmed with all those negative thoughts, and at the same time, I would feel highly irritable and aggressive where I would eventually hurt myself. I am also suicidal.

So last night, I had another attack. I kept walking back and forth crying and laughing in my room. I would then cut my hair unevenly and pour hot water on my hands but I was not satisfied. My s/o, who just came home from work, was annoyed at my actions. He was always trying to understand me but during my extremes he would somehow scold me and be annoyed. This agitated and triggered my. I kept on slapping myself and bounced and fell. I managed to strain my back last night and it was super painful and I was so scared I might die because I heard cracking in my neck and chest (spine) and I can't move because of the pain. I stayed in the floor, crying. My s/o was confused he didn't see what happened and kept asking me, irritated but I can't answer. He left me there for several minutes. I became enraged and blamed everyone else. Then I realized again that I was so scared and cried hard. I tried to crawl out of my house to ask for help and managed to stand and get my phone instead. 

I called both the mental health hotline and a trusted friend who advised me to go to the ER. My s/o calmed down and brought me then to the hospital. Thankfully, I did not have any fractures. I had to lie in the hospital about how I injured myself just so it can be covered by my health card/insurance. 

After that I kinda searched if there is a link between mania and violence and turns out it did. That is why I was very impulsive and very agitated when I was overwhelmed with negative feelings. I thought it was only meant for positive things. And it was scary. I did not want this, but it's hard when some people you love don't understand that.

Sorry for the long post. I don't know how to summarize this. I don't know if anyone would read this but I'm just ranting. I'm exhausted.",bipolar_disorder

"I was on 600mg three times a day for nerve pain. But my psychiatrist said she can increase it to 800 and see if that helps. She says off label it can be used as a mood stabilizer.

So I hope that helps. I'll start my new dose this evening for bedtime. That reminds me I have to take it again before bedtime too. Oof.

"I was stable for most of last year. It was the longest I ever been stable. Towards the end of the year I had a really bad episode. It started in October with depression so we started adjusting my meds. By December I was in the hospital because I had voices in my head telling me to kill myself. Then things got better for a couple weeks at the start of this year. But two weeks ago I got manic and paranoid. I was back in the hospital. Well it was a respite center but it basically a mild hospital. 

And now Iâ€™m depressed. We increased a dosage of one of my meds and I hope it works. I just keep missing work and Iâ€™m missing work again tomorrow. I just want to be stable again. It just feels like Iâ€™m suffering endlessly.

"Hi, I am a 28 year old dude (FtM), a number of events have happened the past few months that have led up to this and I wanted to share my experience. I guess I will start with my history from the earliest I remember.

When I was young I got diagnosed with Aspergers (now just on the ASD spectrum I think), and ADHD, and general anxiety. My parents put me on Paxil around ages 8-9 and I continued to take it until I was 16. I was on Ritalin as well from around that age to around ages 12 or 13. When I was 16 my parents decided I ""don't need Paxil anymore"" and I was medically tapered off of it. After that I had a year and a half long clinical depression episode. 

My family went into upheaval when I was 18, my last year of high school, and my parents were having a very nasty divorce. My mom developed alcoholism and became a violent alcoholic as a result of the stress of the divorce. My mother was severely emotionally abusive and verbally abusive and she has suspected undiagnosed BPD/NPD (as my old therapist speculated). My psych tried to put me on Prozac while I was still depressed but it made me suicidal so I stopped it.

I was put in an inpatient hospital because of suicidal tendencies/actions and I got diagnosed with MDD in the hospital. After I got out I got put back on Vyvanse, which I had been taking in high school some years, but it started to make me feel weird so I stopped taking it for the last end of high school. However I noticed a change in my behavior I did not recognize at the time, I feel like this was the onset of my illness. A month or so I experienced some interpersonal fallout and ended up freaking out and exploding into a rage at the people involved, and after that just got worse. I started to become very ""activated"", get a short temper and explode into rages at people over very minor things and scream at people, I was very aggressive, I had severe anxiety and trouble sleeping and eating, I lost a lot of weight. I would talk a lot and very fast when I was ""anxious"" and not make a lot of sense at times. Myfriends started to get concerned about me. When I got infatuated with my first long distance GF I became obsessive and impulse a bunch of stuff for her on my parents credit card. I didn't really realize I was probably experiencing mania at the time. I was like this even when I hadnt taken Vyvanse in a few weeks.

I got pretty depressed for a few weeks after that but then when I started Vyvanse again it started to make me freak out again. The comedowns also made me legit suicidal and have severe mood swings and paranoia. I would swing over very minor things, usually interpersonal or emotional stuff and it was extremely difficult to regualte my mood or emotions. (this was about a year after I was first hospitalized). It got so bad I started going to my college psych and he said I might have BPD and gave me Abilify, Lamictal, and Xanax. Then I had another social falling out where I was pretty much exiled from my community and friend group which sent me into a suicidal spiral again so I was hospitalized again. I ended up dropping out of school and going back home, I stopped taking the meds my psychiatrist had prescribed me. 

In June I had an episode where I was experiencing extreme paranoia and having visions/images of people I saw in public that were extremely violent, disturbing, or sexual and I started to freak out. I had been lied about by one of my friends saying I was a p\*dophile and so I started to freak out and be paranoid I was actually one. I almost lost my job because I was avoiding seeing people to not have those thoughts. When I was at work Id get weird urges for example, if I was cutting stuff with a knife to stab my coworkers, or when I was driving to run myself off a freeway overpass or mow over pedestrians. I was freaking out and becoming super paranoid and delusional I was a murderer or sexual abuser. I told my current psych about it and he said ""oh you might have OCD"" and put me on Lexapro, I had asked to be back on Paxil but he said it had too many negative side effects and people were being prescribed Lexapro instead of Paxil recently. This was summer 2014.

It immediately made the paranoid delusions and intrusive thought loops go away and I was on it for several years after that. I was in a severely stressful abusive relationship where I had to be the sole provider and was extremely overworked, so I started to develop substance abuse problems. I became addicted to Kratom and Adderall/Ritalin and heavily abused them, I also was taking opiates like oxys and vicodin. I then started to lose the effects of Lexapro so I asked my psych to try out Zoloft but I immediately bcame paranoid, aggressive, and anxious, and I lost my ability to sleep so I quit taking it very quickly. I then switched to Prozac and didn't have any problems.

I was binge drinking a lot during the stress of my breakup bc I did end up breaking up with the person in that toxic rship but stopped for a while, but I was still binge drinking a lot socially. I then stopped taking SSRIs period last September and switched to Wellbutrin. I started at 150 and it made me anxious and jittery but I thought it was just me adjusting to the meds. I got in a new relationship in September and I was very elated and happy and talking peoples ears off, and I was on that high for weeks, IDK if it was just me being in love or hypomania or not. There was another interpersonal explosion that happened in my local friend circle a few weeks after and I exploded into a rage once again at people and would lash out when people tried to calm me down, I got so angry I was road raging people and punching walls and stuff. I then got a tonsil infection that same month (October) and was put on steroids, those made me have paranoid delusions/inability to eat or sleep/extreme anger problems, I would start screaming and exploding at people over the smallest things and I even threw stuff on the ground/wall breaking it, slammed doors and punched walls etc. I thought it was just mania induced by the steroids, but I had a previous infection in June and took the same steroids and this did NOT happen. 

After I stopped the steroids I calmed down but still would explode very easily and felt neurotic af. I want to note also I completely quit Kratom in November and havent taken it since. but after quitting Kratom I was really sensitive to emotional stuff and would cry a lot but I thought it was just me relieving my years of emotional debt repressed by SSRIs and substance use (I mean it probably was mostly). Was still on 150 wellbutrin. I felt stable for a while though and thought I adjusted to the meds. In January I increased my dose to 300 wellbutrin and immediately got a lot more irritable and restless, but still somewhat stable. In mid January my boyfriends best friend died and I was very sensitive to the overall grief and tragedy and I felt myself start to get manic again. I didnt recognize it as that I saw it as anxiety or grief.

There was another interpersonal conflict a few weeks later, and I started to freak out about it. I made the mistake of using adderall after a month of not using it to get some work done but then I started to get very irritable and paranoid and not sleep, so I stopped it imemdiately, but I didnt improve, I just continued to worsen. 

 After this it launched me into full blown mania, I was having panic attacks every day and I was pacing in circles nonstop, was talking very fast and nonsensically, my mind felt like TV channels flipping at 100mph back and forth. I would wall of text a bunch of people at once and my self control and impulsivity/ability to control my emotions completely went out of the window. I was impulse spending a lot, I felt this unusual level of confidence and was way more confrontational than usual. I woke up every day feeling completely activated and was getting 1-2 hours of sleep every night for 2 weeks. I was exploding into rages without warning at people I care about like I was months before, I would cry a lot afterwards and have meltdowns. People said I ""had a different look in my eyes"" when I was manic and raging, they said my pupils were as wide as saucers. I was also binge drinking like crazy more than I ever had before, I downed 2 bottles of tequila in less than a week and I had never drank like that before because I didnt know how else to sedate myself, Gabapentin was not working. I was driving recklessly to the point I was trying to run people off the road and road raging all the time, I did not feel safe or trust myself enough to even drive. I had to put a bunch of my money into a separate account and have my partner control it so I wouldnt do anything impulsive. My partner has bp2 and is on lamictal and as a desperate measure they gave me some extras and I was self medicating on like 100mg a day but knew I couldnt do that bc it wasnt safe and needed medical professional help. I was also self medicating with cannabis because it was also one of the only other things that sedated my mania.

I went to my doctor, I was bouncing my knees nonstop while sitting down and talking rapid fire and incoherently, they had to calm me down to get me to talk to where it made sense and in order. Id talk sitting there looking around/darting my eyes back and forth rapidly and hyperventilating and talking in circles. When the doctor was out of the room Id pace around listlessly in circles super fast bc I couldnt sit still. My doctor told me that I have a substance abuse disorder and I need to quit drinking immediately because she said it makes my rages worse. She said she thinks I should not be taking any stimulants incl Wellbutrin period because it makes my mania worse, even to watch out about too much caffeine. She said I definitely have a form of manic depression/bipolar but I need to go to a hospital or psychologist for an official diagnosis.

She put me on lamictal immediately, asked if I wanted seroquel or lithium and I said no because I had bad experiences with more ""heavy"" mood stabilizers. Im getting naltrexone to help with my alcohol and drug cravins. 

Ive been on lamictal for like a month and its pretty much changed my life, I still feel mania but its pretty under control. Its ""ripples"" instead of ""huge waves"", I still feel it under the surface tho. I also have PTSD and its really helped with my avoidance issues from PTSD/emotional walls and rejection dysphoria. I want to note my mania is severe but my depression is pretty much just ""Im tired"". I'm on 100mg right now but I'm going to 200 soon but I feel like I'll have to be on an higher dose even. My mania now is pretty much hypomania and its induced when Im under severe stress. I still lose my temper if I feel overwhelmed so Im going to anger management classes possibly. 

I still took wellbutrin after my doctor told me not to (same dose 300mg, its from a different doctor than her) but I realized recently that it makes my irritability/symptoms way worse so I am quitting it. I think Lamictal is enough to control my depression it does not control my mania completely but since I am sober now I am learning different ways to regulate it and my emotions/anxiety rather than repressing it with drinking or drugs. Ive been sober for over a month now and I even quit cannabis.

Anyway that is my experience and I'm writing this to see if anyone else can relate or has a similar experience especially with Wellbutrin. doctors who say its fine to treat bipolar with it are wrong IMO, its different with bp2 i think since the depression is worse for people with it as far as the people Ive talked to with it, but I dont think its good for bp1 at all. But everyone is different this is just my experience. 

Take care everyone. I have been lurking this sub reddit for a while and a lot of peoples experiences are really similar to mine and i felt so much relief, especially since I didnt know what was wrong with me for over a decade.",bipolar_disorder

"I met this guy. I liked him, I could tell he liked me back. However, he got mad that another guy was flirting with me and said that he liked me. I wasnâ€™t supposed to know what he said, but our friends told me. I asked him, and he had to come clean that he had a girlfriend. We live in different countries, so I figured that we could be social media friends at least. He denied it so I figured it was all a big misunderstanding. However, he waited two weeks before rejecting the Instagram request. I blocked him. They broke up two months later, and now, itâ€™s been a year and a half and he still stalks my social media. 

Itâ€™s fine if you think that Iâ€™m this nefarious homewrecker. I donâ€™t care. I know itâ€™s not true. But think of it this way: letâ€™s pretend that youâ€™re in your late teens, and you never had any romantic interest reciprocated before. Youâ€™ve seen several classmates and friends get attention of other guys, but you havenâ€™t. You meet someone that you genuinely like, and they like you back. But because theyâ€™re with someone else (not blaming the other person, just saying), theyâ€™re okay with never seeing or talking to you again. 

Fuck!!! Do you think he felt any remorse? Did he even feel bad? I want to kill myself. Iâ€™m never making the first move again, Iâ€™m never trusting another guy again. Why??? Why did he say that if he wasnâ€™t going to pursue anything with me? Gaslight me all you want. Say that Iâ€™m this horrible, awful person for wanting a taken man. Fine. But I was deceived. He never once bought up the fact that he had a girlfriend. He shouldnâ€™t have gotten so jealous about the other guy. And he shouldnâ€™t have said that he liked me. 

Wtf is he doing??? Stalking my social media. One of my friends said I should reach out to him. Iâ€™ll be damned!!! At this point, Iâ€™d rather be with the other guy, and the other guy just wanted sex. Yes I admit he was just trying to right by his girlfriend, but did he have to hurt me?

"Yo guys, if everyone out there is suffering from bipolar disorder or adhd i want to share something. I have very severe bipolar plus adhd, but bipolar is more important to me, my entire life and because of it i did some crazy things etc. I wanted to share that i've done like a lot and a lot of research my entire life and i found myself some very powerful solutions.. 

This may not be end all be all and something universal but i've found some pretty wild and magic stuff. I've quit all forms of caffeine for a week and literally 85% of the symptoms dissapeared and i again became a present and functional human being. I've found many studies which conclude that people with bipolar get really triggered by caffeine and that it increases the episodes and symptoms.

Another very powerful stuff i've found from my entire life of observing and experimenting, researching, you gotta quit smoking/nicotine if you smoke. Only by that your mental health will explode in a positive way. Smoking increases inflammations in the brain and does many other nasty stuff.

And something else, i started taking magnesium and vitamin b12. But its not that simple. There is a huge difference what type and form of supplements you take. Magnesium bysglicinate (Terranova brand) does wonders for my stress levels, bipolar symptoms and my ability to stay functional and present during the day. Also B12. Methylcobalamine form, not cyanocobalamine, and also terranova brand. This brand is amazing because they put 0% unnecessary ingredients and they also add small amounts of liofilized nutritious vegetables into the mix to further increase the absorption and synergy of the supplement, thats why i fell in love with this brand. Those two supplements did wonders for my mental health, i swear it. 

I also found studies that conclude that people with bipolar and adhd have defficienct in magnesium and b12 in their brain. Without magnesium ou brains mitochondria cannot produce molecule called ATP which is literally the energy molecule. And B12 is one of the most important cofactors in the synthesis of serotonin, dopamine and other neurotransmitters. I think that most of the population is defficient in those two nutrients. But remember that it is really important which form you take and which brand. There are different types of magnesium and b12 and they all have different levels of absorptions and they do different stuff in the body/brain. 

And my ""secret"" cheat code that i've found for myself if i want to completely remove bipolar, adhd, anxiety and every single mental disorder that i have is ketogenic diet. Its very crazy stuff but i wont write further about it in this post so i dont bother you guys to much, but its worth researching it if you struggle with your mental health. Im sharing this from a place of infinite suffering that i've gone through and almost destroyed my life multiple times, i have nothing to gain from writing this post. Just some friendly advices and sharing my own story.

Thank you for reading. &lt;3",bipolar_disorder
"To start off, iâ€™ve been diagnosed by three separate psychiatrists due to several being in a residential treatment center which is disconnected from my main healthcare system. This cost and several other surprise medical costs for my cat have kind of put me in a place where i canâ€™t afford very much in the terms of therapy (which never worked for me but makes my friends/family happy) and my meds are running low from that period. Those medications are recognized by my doctor as non-refillable despite the suggestion that i take them until im immune or i turn 45. I donâ€™t even know if i can  swing a doctors appointment right now because i have to care for my catâ€™s physical condition first since itâ€™s basically all i have right now. 

I also know that even on meds my lack of enjoyment in life is terrible. I just donâ€™t have any hobbies or interests or career paths besides that which iâ€™ve hyper fixated on. sadly even those grow stale and all im left with is useless information because even though iâ€™m hyper-fixated, thereâ€™s no deeper understanding sometimes. every time i try to reach out into a community, something sours my mouth and it feels like i canâ€™t go back. this combined with all long-term goals being curdled by the state of the world and how it continues to function as it always has leads me to feeling like the meds arenâ€™t even worth it? but I just genuinely donâ€™t know what to do. the people in my circles have kind of all suggested i go to a mental hospital again but instead of my AN-R/BP, my underlying issues would be the focus. but that is more money than iâ€™m even willing to go into debt over. 

I just honestly feel like even though iâ€™m medicated and safe, I will never be fulfilled. my mania is typically anger focused and my depression regrets all of it. over and over again unless i take my meds. then i take them and the moods stop but my outlook on life is the same. i just donâ€™t even know where to start.

"O.A.R â€œThat was a crazy game of pokerâ€

Oh my
20 throw down in my fist of rage
And the man to my left has folded down


Well Johnny doubled up with a royal flush
I had three Jacks and a pair of nines
My mind is turning, just two shots more
There's not much left to play

Well then dude walks in, black hat on top
What am I, if I'm lucky
Wasn't a county cop
'Cause I'm just runnin' out of time

Who's up for game two
What to do
My wallet's gettin' thin
And I just lost my watch last night
Well I gotta problem

Just one answer
Gotta throw it all down
And kiss it goodbye
Yeah!

That was a crazy game of poker (That was a crazy game of poker)
I lost it all (I lost it all)
But someday I'll be back again
And I, never to fold. (Never to fold)

Who's up for game three
I can barely see the bourbon drowning next to me
And I just lost it all

Well there's a man sittin' next to me
Red, was smiling
'Cause it's funny
I don't have no money tonight

Well how bout that?
I'm coming out the front never coming out the back

And I walked into the bar yesterday
'Cause I had something to do, something to say
And Johnny walked in right behind me
And I didn't turn around
'Til I heard the sound of his feet
Falling on the ground

I looked over my shoulder and I saw a clown
And I said what'cha doin' in the bar tonight.
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright
And I said, how 'bout a revolution?
And he said right.
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah jah jah
Jehovah!

And I said, what'cha looking at?
He hit me across the face with a bat
I grabbed my .45 and I said let's get out and go

So he opened the door and said
Do what you're here for
I said I'm wandering round the road four to four

And I said I been walking
For about a thousand years.
And my feet are growing tired
My eyes a little wired
Don't know what to do unless I retire
And he just said let's play some crazy poker

So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright
And I said, how 'bout a revolution?
And he said right.
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say die

I don't give a shit cause I got the drop
Johnny just got two eyes just like mine
And I'm feeling kinda funky, kinda fine
And I drank a bottle of whiskey, 'fore I came
Came to the bar to see what's the same

I saw my man named Johnny sittin' across the table from me
And to my left was a man, he had no chin
Didn't really think about starting a scene
The man to my right wasn't feeling kinda nice
He looked kinda mad and I felt bad
Because I took his money last night it's kinda funny
But now I'm just struggling
I need a honey-bunny.
I don't know what to say anymore
So I'm just gonna go out, anywho

Thing isâ€¦ Iâ€™m headed north for a few weeks from pure sun to pure clouds. I bought the extra heavy duty vitD to help curb the extreme low from the weather change. The stress of the trip is definitely getting my weird tics from other disorders flaring. OCD and ADHD are wreaking havoc and Iâ€™m struggling to stay aware of it. Iâ€™m headed up to try and get help from my current drs but idk if it will turn out good. I hate when I know Iâ€™m in an episode. I want to stop myself from all of the things but then I blink and all is forgotten in my awareness and Iâ€™m off spending $. Man. Iâ€™m tired but life prevails and I must keep going. At least this oneâ€™s not a wild bad one. I feel stableish until the tics get heavy.. hate it. Blah.,bipolar_disorder
"There's a lot of people in this story, so I'll give you a list

Maria (15): my second cousin from Mexico

Sancha (41): Maria's mom

Vera (68): Maria's grandma

Aunt Isabel (53): my mother's sister, so my aunt

Uncle David (57): my mother's brother, my uncle

Aunt Stella (49): Uncle David's wife

Arturo (25): my first cousin who is from America but lives in Mexico

I was in Mexico with my mom's side of the family in the small town that my grandparents are from. Since Maria and I are close in age, we frequently hung out together. The day started off as usual with everyone hanging out as a family. Everyone in my family, including Maria and Vera, hung out with us. Maria and I went to hang out with Maria's friends, and we left the rest of the family at the bullfighting stadium.

We hung out for about an hour before Maria's dad called. He was yelling at her because she went out without his permission. She told me to walk with her to Vera's house. Maria's been so good to me, and I wasn't going to let my little cousin walk by herself at nine at night. I texted Arturo if he knew if the rest of the family was still by the plaza. He texted me that he wasn't sure, and that he was at a friend's house. I then tried calling and texting Aunt Isabel, Uncle David, and Aunt Stella, but no one answered.

When we got to Vera's house, Vera was about to go do some shopping. Since Vera was with my family when I left, I asked her if she knew if anyone was at the house. We had been out for eight hours and I was fine going home. She said Aunt Isabel and my grandma were home. Sancha then pulled up in her car, because she'd been working nearby all day and was settling in for the night.

She drove me to my grandma's house. I don't have a key, and no one was home. When I pulled up, my uncle David called me and told me that they were at the plaza but going to walk home. They walked the two blocks home. I hadn't eaten anything since twelve, and since we were only two blocks away from the plaza, I asked if we were going back. My uncle said ""no, since you decided to leave the plaza"". My uncle then started talking to Sancha, because he's staying in another house, and he asked if he and Stella could get a ride home. I was talking to Aunt Stella, and I wasn't able to go into detail, but I expressed dismay over having them leave the plaza. Aunt Stella said ""I know, I'm pissed too.""

My grandma and Aunt Isabel let me into the house. Immediately, Aunt Isabel started asking questions. But they weren't questions of curiosity or concern. I could tell that she was trying to find any flaw in the story in order to hammer it home.

""Why did you leave the plaza? I told you we were going to be there."" (No she didn't)

""Why couldn't you stay at Vera's house?""

""Where was Vera going?""

""Why didn't you call anyone?""

I told her, and she checked her phone and saw the text and calls. I then went upstairs and cried for the rest of the night. I didn't eat either. But next time she does that, I'll kill myself. She's not a good person. Also, she has a schizophrenic son at home (mental illness runs in the family). Why can't she take care of him and be a good mother, instead of partying in another country?",bipolar_disorder
"I donâ€™t drink frequently (maybe once a month), and when I do I try not to drink very much because of my meds. Last night I went out with friends, had about 3 drinks spaced out (Iâ€™m on the larger side) with food and had a very good time. 

Today, Iâ€™ve been in a deep depression. No hangover symptoms or anything. Just horribly depressed. 

This happens almost every time I drink and it can last 2-3 days. Idk if itâ€™s a bipolar thing or what. It makes me sad because I want to be able to have a few drinks with friends every now and then but this depression I get afterwards is just miserable.",bipolar_disorder

"Iâ€™m having such a depressed day, I thought we got the meds right this time I was feeling much better and starting to do more but the Seroquel has such an impact on my heart rate that Iâ€™m tapering down. 

I canâ€™t help but cry because I thought I finally got the right combo. I really did, and I am missing out on life. I left my job to get treatment and now Iâ€™m seeing that things may not be returning to normal again anytime soon. 

I guess Iâ€™m just looking for words of encouragement or support, feeling very sad about the life Iâ€™m currently living",bipolar_disorder
"I feel so frustrated with myself, I can't even handle going to work for a few hours because when I come back I basically shut off mentally and can't get anything done. I struggle as much as it is with concentration and motivation because of my ADHD but having to go to work aggravates it. I end up exhausted for days following, unable to do work because I'm so burnt out. This is making my life a living hell, I'm constantly behind in school, especially if the class doesn't interest me. I have tried everything- fixing my sleep schedule, putting my phone away when I need to do work, eating properly, and it feels like nothing is working. I also can't do work past 8 pm or so because at that point in the day I'm already exhausted, even if I didn't do anything all day. Does this happen to anyone else? Any advice?",bipolar_disorder
"Hi everyone, not exactly my first post but I've been wanting to post this ""first"" post for the longest time. I was diagnosed as bipolar when I was younger, and then had a lot of failed attempts at meds, therapy and suicide. Did A TON of regrettable stuff, and then got married and found a way to function through my episodes. Apparently not so well, because as much I begin to forget/challenge the idea that I might be bipolar, I started seeking therapy again. My therapist took all of 3 months to point out that I might be bipolar and I was like - erm, guess what, I was diagnosed 20 years ago. 

While I try to wrap my head around the idea, and find trust in the psychiatric system of the new country I'm in, I'm just wondering - who knows you are bipolar. My husband (whom I vacillate between hating and tolerating) knows but doesn't and will never understand. I've two school-age kids who are growing up to understand mom is a lil off at time, and I wish so much to explain to them and shield them from my madness. My family is terrible and traumatic so I don't want to tell them and they never would have understood. I mean my mom was probably involved when I was younger and was in a psychiatric hold but she ended up making it all about her and how miserable her life is.

I have some friends I trust - but nobody knows anything about me regarding this. I have some friends from my past - who might think that I've outgrown whatever emotional shit I went through in my youth.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I really want to ask - if you have kids, when do you start trying to let your kids understand? And would you tell your employer and co-workers and new friends? If you really like them but they have only seen the hyper functional side of you?",bipolar_disorder
I've had periods of time where I feel restless and agitated but also extremely depressed. I suspect these were mixed episodes and I'm trying to see what it feels like for other people.,bipolar_disorder
"I know itâ€™s not good and not how we should be, but Iâ€™m about to go see my new psychiatrist and get back on meds for the first time in years (Iâ€™ve neglected my mental health and itâ€™s plummeted). Stupid move.

I canâ€™t handle the month long depression, the weird in-between phases where Iâ€™m super agitated. But I LOVE feeling alive and actually cleaning and feeling motivated to be the me I used to be. It all just goes away and itâ€™s not fair. 

Mania is definitely not all sunshine as we know though. I get delusional, I think thereâ€™s beings listening to my thoughts, that everybody could be after me, utility workers being spies sent to find me. Thatâ€™s the part of mania I donâ€™t like, just want to know who I actually â€œamâ€. Not a clue.",bipolar_disorder
"I have a few questions and just wanted to see if any of you guys relate as well. I believe I have been manic for about 3 weeks to a month now. My symptoms have mostly been hypomanic more so, like speaking very rapidly and excessively, starting many things but can't finish, some grandiose type thoughts, but I have had periods of a few days or so where my hallucinations and psychosis get really bad, I self-harm excessively, and my symptoms seem to be more like full blown mania. But then, in the midst of this, I get what I call these ""moments of clarity"" that usually last less than a day. I get very aware that I was/am indeed manic, freak out about the money I have spent, the severity of myself harm, things I have said to people, etc. But then this goes away, and I go back to feeling either manic or depressed. Is this typical among people with bipolar? (As of now I am diagnosed with Bipolar NOS). I am fairly newly diagnosed and want to make sure I am using the right words for these things. I guess I am not sure of what type of episode I may be having but it definitely feels pretty severe, and these sudden shifts are getting exhausting. I am having one of these moments of clarity today and I just don't know if there is anything I can or should do to prepare for whatever the next phase is.",bipolar_disorder
"Hi everyone! So my psychiatrist of three years said sheâ€™s leaving her previous practice and because she is not licensed in my state I canâ€™t see her anymore. I found an NP psychiatrist, but i dont know how to explain 3+ yeArs of problems to her. How do I go about doing this? Friends joked saying I should make a PowerPoint but genuinely I have no idea what to say. Should I just wait for her to ask my questions during my evaluation with her?",bipolar_disorder
"I've always known that I was meant for something great. I had no idea why, but I think I know why now.

So, my crush is the best person in the world. I like him, and I'm positive he likes me back. He told me once about something traumatic that happened to him in high school. When he was a sophomore, this senior boy bullied him. I don't know exactly what happened, but he had to get a restraining order against him for three years. They went to court and had lawyers and everything.

The restraining order is voided now, but I still worry for him. I know it's none of my business, but I want to be with him, and I want to protect him. He's so good to me, and I need to know how to be good for him. The guy lives over seven hours away driving, but he's still out there. And he's from our hometown. I'm sure he comes back for family holidays and things like that.

If it got to the point where he had to get a restraining order, he probably did multiple things to my crush. And when asked to stop, he didn't listen. Granted, maybe he's changed, but unless he's gotten serious therapy, I doubt it. I don't want my crush to be traumatized more than he already has, but if worst comes to worst, I know I'll be a great defense! I'm bipolar, and I can transfer that into strength to fight this guy. Maybe I'm a bit of a yandere, but I'm going to defend the people I care about. There's no shame in that. I'll only fight him if he tries to hurt my crush; I won't actively seek him out. However, I'm wondering if I should learn self defense? Or just get a really good weapon?",bipolar_disorder
"Sorry if this is all over the place and not structured well Iâ€™m not good at writing long things I hope you guys will still give your input.

So to give a bit of back story, I (18m) have been dating this girl (17) for 6 months now she suffers from bipolar 1. From the beginning she had given me a heads up and was very hard on herself basically saying she doesnâ€™t deserve a relationship and that she planned on being alone her whole life. She has also been through a lot of other traumatic things in her life. Although she has been through a lot and continues to struggle with bipolar 1 she has a great support system around her, that includes me and her parents we are very much involved with helping her out constantly and always wanting to do whatâ€™s best we are very very proactive about this. This girl has been the best thing thatâ€™s happened to me ever and I donâ€™t say that lightly. She has brought me out of the darkest period of my life and has significantly helped me get my shit together and always supports me. Iâ€™ve experienced episodes of depression, short manic episodes and hallucinations. But over this last month she has been in a severe manic episode Keep in mind I have only seen her in manic episodes for maybe 3-4 days max and they werenâ€™t that bad. My girlfriend is the type of girl who is very clingy sheâ€™s knows sheâ€™s clingy and sheâ€™s s like that on purpose but I donâ€™t mind I personally love how clingy she is. She literally couldnâ€™t go more than 10 minutes without messaging me we used to be on FaceTime everyday all day. She also likes to fall asleep on the phone with me. at first I didnâ€™t really understand it but itâ€™s become part of my routine and when it doesnâ€™t happen it really gets to me. So over this last month she has been very distant like we will go all day with little to no messages and at the end of the night I might get a good conversation out of her if Iâ€™m lucky. She never FaceTimes me anymore I basically have to convince her to FaceTime me and when we are on FaceTime usually itâ€™s good so thatâ€™s a plus. She has been inconsistent in calling me to fall asleep because she says her new meds (anti psychotics) make her just pass out which Iâ€™ve experienced first hand but I think itâ€™s become more of an excuse lately because she will be up 1 minute Iâ€™ll text her to ask if sheâ€™s going to bed soon and she will still be active and I wonâ€™t get a call or even a goodnight. We also went from hanging out 2-3 times a week to 0 I literally havenâ€™t seen her for the last month not even for a few minutes. She says sheâ€™s scared to lash out on me and hurt me because she is very irritable and has a past of getting physical with past partners when in episodes like this. This has been tremendously difficult for me because we havenâ€™t gone a single week without seeing each other in the last 6 months until now and itâ€™s been a month. She was a super affectionate and always complimented me before. I get 0 compliments even when I send her a photo of me looking good when she would normally hype me up itâ€™s like itâ€™s nothing to her. I used to wake up to a â€œgood morning baby I love you soooooo muchâ€ or a â€œgood morning my handsome boyfriend I hope you had a good sleep I love you sooo muchâ€ and now all I get is a simple â€œgood morning I love youâ€ no emoji or anything that may sound stupid but the emoji does make the difference it takes more effort into putting the emoji. She has been hanging out with her best friend (F) almost every day and she wonâ€™t tell me where sheâ€™s going or when sheâ€™s going out which is unusual for her very unusual. Although we have each otherâ€™s locations so I can check up on her. She never really hides anything from me and at the end of the night she will at least tell me who she was with and what they did although not always in much detail. I do get worried about what she gets up to not because I donâ€™t trust her but because Iâ€™m concerned about her current state and I know itâ€™s common to do things you wouldnâ€™t normally do. I get insecure because of all of this and I get paranoid about her cheating even though I know for 100% that she wouldnâ€™t be that kind of girl and yes Iâ€™m that certain. But I just donâ€™t know where the line gets drawn when you are in a manic episode this bad. She isnâ€™t horny which gives me some peace of mind like she is normally very sexual and horny but sheâ€™s hasnâ€™t been like that for awhile probably just before her episode really started and when we were still doing amazing. When I say there was nothing wrong in our relationship before this I mean it we never argued we always enjoyed each otherâ€™s company we pretty much only hung out with each other. It all only changed when she got into this episode so basically over this last month. The other night I was talking to her and we some how got on the topic of cheating. And I had asked out of curiosity what she would do if I cheated on her. This was just to see what her answer would be in this mental state and boy was it the complete opposite of what she would normally say. She basically said that she wouldnâ€™t care and that she would just move on and not dwell on it out of self respect which kinda hurt a little because the way she was talking made it seem like she didnâ€™t care about what happens in our relationship. Her normal response as fucked up as it sounds is â€œI would probably kill myself or end up in a mental hospitalâ€ weirdly enough that answer never bothered me because I would never cheat on her. So basically after all this Iâ€™m left sitting here thinking if itâ€™s truly her bipolar that has made her care so little about our relationship or if itâ€™s her genuine feelings. I find that over this last month Iâ€™ve seen glimpses of what sheâ€™s normally like where she will ask me about my day or genuinely be here for me and we will talk all day so that part of her still comes out sometimes so it gives me a little hope. Anyways I would love to hear everyoneâ€™s thoughts on this and if itâ€™s just the bipolar or if I should worry about my relationship.",bipolar_disorder
"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2 when I was 20 years old. Iâ€™m now 23 and struggling more than I was originally. Backstory: my parents had me at 20 years old unexpectedly. Theyâ€™re very â€œjust get over itâ€ type of people. They also were extremely abusive all throughout high school/early college. When I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 2, they told me that they didnâ€™t believe me and they felt that I lied to my doctor. So they no longer funded my psychiatrist appointments. I had mood stabilizers for about a month that I would take until they stopped funding my appointments. Fast forward 3 years and I feel like my episodes are much stronger and much more difficult to deal with. Itâ€™s been difficult to get in touch with my psychiatrist because my parents will take me off of the insurance and then randomly have me back on as a â€œrewardâ€ for â€œgood behavior.â€ I dropped out of college and have a hard time keeping a job without meds. I spoke with my primary doctor and she prescribed me Zoloft 50mg for anxiety/depression. After taking it, I felt so overstimulated that I couldnâ€™t move. I got paranoid and thought that my partner (of over a year and half ) was secretly testing me and working with my family. (I know that that sounds crazy) Iâ€™ve never experienced mania like this before. Usually Iâ€™ll experience things like: no sleep, not eating, sometimes my eyes will dilate, reckless spending/driving, mind going 10000 miles an hour, and all of the other stuff that isnâ€™t deemed â€œdangerous.â€ This was different though. I can confidently say that I have experienced delusions while being hypo manic, but theyâ€™re usually not extreme. This was the first time that Iâ€™ve experienced something like this and felt like I couldnâ€™t trust someone that I love and actually trust very much. Can anyone relate to these feelings? Im in the process of getting help, it just feels very lonely and as if nobody in my life understands the emotional rollercoaster this is.",bipolar_disorder
It seems like psychosis seems to have enduring patterns. It's often religious in nature or paranoia about someone or the government spying on you. Why do you think that is? For those of you who have had psychosis did it relate to religious beliefs you already had or some smaller fears you had getting blown up bigger?,bipolar_disorder
No I did not self diagnose myself I actually went to therapy but I was living with my brother at the time with his ex girlfriend and they were the ones that took me into therapy. but I now live with my father and I feel guilty on how I act towards him but he doesn't believe in any disorders expect for insomnia (which my step mom has),bipolar_disorder

Iâ€™m not really talking to her lately after I no showed a couple of her appts after she over charged me $300 for care. If I saw a therapist I would have to start from scratch and Iâ€™m not even sure I can explain myself. Iâ€™m not suicidal I would never do anything not only because I think itâ€™s wrong but because my family wouldnâ€™t get a million dollar insurance policy.

"I recently started therapy (about a month ago now). I already suspected I might be bipolar as both sides (mom and dad) have history with it. Last session my therapist said she suspects I might be bipolar and recommended I see a psychiatrist. I see the psychiatrist in a week but, now I'm starting to doubt myself. She asked me all these questions and I'm worried that I tricked myself into agreeing with her. I know for a fact I have depressive episodes but I never really get that elated feeling from mania. I definitely have periods where I get very limited to no sleep and still function well. I tend to hyperfocus on random tasks during these periods but at the same time feel like my mind is racing if that makes any sense but I'm not happy. I'm still depressed/numb during these times. Is this still mania?",bipolar_disorder
"Itâ€™s kinda funny cuz Iâ€™m still kinda in denial that I have bipolar but one thing that kind of clicks for me is that antipsychotics are the only medications Iâ€™ve tried that have actually made me feel normal/good. I took Prozac and Zoloft in high school and they made me feel like I was on another planet. I take Latuda and I think I might be lucky compared to some others that I found a med that work wells and has little side effects(and I can afford it). I just see a lot of posts about people complaining about meds. Yeah sometimes I miss the random bursts of creativity and the euphoria/productivity of hypomania/mania but I can think so much more coherently now and actually participate in life as a productive member of society. Idk if any of you have seen Taylor Tomilsons stand up but the way she describes meds really resonate with me. She said something along the lines of â€œsome people donâ€™t like psych meds because they donâ€™t feel like themselves, and Iâ€™m like me neither itâ€™s the bestâ€ Lol. Idk kinda a ramble but Iâ€™m just grateful for meds. Havenâ€™t had depression or hypomania/mania in months, I donâ€™t run out of money every 2 weeks, not saying weird delusional shit to my friends, and Iâ€™m not flunking out of school anymore. I use to feel like my life could fall to shambles at any moment. Anyways to those who havenâ€™t found a med that works for them yet, donâ€™t give up, the benefits and clarity they can bring are so worth it.",bipolar_disorder
"Gonna keep this short - basically I went through a year of the worst rapid cycling and mixed episodes I ever had.  I only had one friend at the time and I became super dependent on them.  They started coming on to me in very inappropriate ways even though I indicated I was not interested (directly telling them not to do something or physically moving away from them)

The problem is that I let this go on for the whole year and kept going back to them even after bad experiences.  I usually froze up when I felt uncomfortable and  even laughed things off.

When I became stable I realized how bad the situation was and broke off the friendship but I feel so guilty for letting it go on for so long.

The only one that did anything was zoloft but I had to stop that because it launched me into a hypo manic episode.

Thereâ€™s been a lot of stress in the house over the last few years, as me and my partner have a child together who has been baker acted a number of times for self harm ideations. 

We are supportive, provide therapy, medication, and a positive environment for her but she has a hard time getting out of the hole. 

Now Iâ€™m in a position mentally I havenâ€™t been in since I was diagnosed a couple years ago. Ive hit one of the lowest mental lows Iâ€™ve seen and I donâ€™t know what to do with it, Iâ€™m not sure whether to cry or curl up in a ball. Iâ€™m having mild self harm ideation. BUT I know for a fact Iâ€™d never act on them. That doesnâ€™t stop the thoughts from coming though, and I canâ€™t stand it. I hate being like this. 

I donâ€™t know what I need that I donâ€™t already give myself. Quiet time, personal space, open communication, meds. I donâ€™t fucking get it. I do all of these things. I wish Elon Musk would drop a chip that could fix my brain so I could maybe actually focus on a career and stop having to constantly be waiting on the next episode.

The med I was prescribed is a once a month injection that costs over 3,000$, so taking meds is simply not an option for me. That's not even including the arm and a leg I would have to pay to see the psychiatrist to keep the prescription

I'm basically stuck just dealing with this on my own, after having a really bad psychosis / mania episode that landed me in the psych ward (first time for me, age 26)

How can I avoid having psychosis again and ruining my life, without taking meds? Part of what put me in this situation is that I was smoking an insane amount of Marijuana every single day, so I'm hoping that if I stay sober I won't get psychosis again, but it's still scary. Are there any techniques I can use to recognize when I'm in psychosis and try to at least hide it and not let it influence my decision making process?

"I hope that Iâ€™m posting this in the right place, if not I apologize. I found out I was pregnant a month ago and told my psychiatrist. They told me I needed to discontinue all of my medications except Seroquel because of the negative affects it could have on the baby. I was terrified to come off my medications because they have worked so well for me the last few years and it took so long to find the right combinations. Iâ€™ve gone through withdrawals and for the most part believe I am past the worst of it. However, I have a new problem, Iâ€™ve started having paranoia. My fiancÃ© works at nights so Iâ€™m home alone most nights during the work week. The last few days Iâ€™ve started to feel terrified to look out the windows at night because Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to see someone staring back at me. When itâ€™s time to go to bed I struggle to fall asleep because when I hear noises Iâ€™m worried someone or something is in the house with me. Iâ€™ve never believed my house was haunted, and Iâ€™ve never had these kind of paranoid thoughts before coming off my medicine. Do you think this is just my pregnant brain being irrational, or is it just due to not being medicated? Should I tell my psychiatrist? It feels so silly to me because I recognize that these feelings are just in my head but I still feel so scared I have to sleep with the light on, or canâ€™t sleep at all.

"TLDR;So, it's been over a year of daily use and now I'm at a cross roads. Any advice on how to quit without completely destroying my stability. 

ðŸ‘‹. 
So I previously was an alcoholic (by medical definition, no health or social issues ever) and it was a bandaid that masked my symptoms before diagnosis as well as for the early stages of medication. 

At the request of my medical team and family, I stopped drinking. We all knew the risks and it just wasn't worth it. The main problem though is drinking was my band-aid and without it I began to struggle again. 

This was unfortunately a highly unstable part of my life as I needed to change providers twice and had multiple full medication changes (crap psych). Because of the problems I had without drinking I started smoking weed. First it started kinda sporadically with off label use of propranolol for anxiety. Then I realized that MJ is 900x better than propranolol at controlling my anxiety, ruminating thoughts, and uncontrollable fixations. 

So it's been over a year now of near daily smoking and I'm having issues maintaining stability over the last few months. It started slowly and has been building to the point of it effecting my family. 

I spoke with my psych team so I don't need in depth medical advice. They are adding abilify to my cocktail and will monitor over the next bit. But the shit part is they, rightfully so, want me to stop all drug/alcohol use until we find the right dosages and mix. I mean, they said forever so I told them that'll only be possible if they can offer actual stability. 

So, for those of you who've done something similar. How can I stop smoking without risking my mental condition deteriorating? Sometimes the anxiety is so bad I physically feel it. Or I'm unable to accomplish what needs to be done. 

They are sending me more propranolol and hoping it works better in conjunction with abilify until I'm stable on those pills but knowing it wasn't enough before, I'm nervous to continue worsening my condition.",bipolar_disorder

"My(20f) best friend (20f) have been close to each other for seven years. There were a lot of ups and downs, especially in the last few years before I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2. She was there for me during a lot of bad times, family issues and mood cycling. 

This past weekend I drove a couple hours to visit her at school and I got a hotel for two nights. We made this plan together a month before, and she was going to stay with me in the hotel. The second night she decided to stay at a different friendâ€™s house (someone she goes to school with), and I got upset. I told her I felt like she was being inconsiderate and she agreed and apologized, but it felt sort of halfhearted, and she gave me a lot of reasons why she had to see that friend (she hadnâ€™t seen him for a week but I hadnâ€™t seen her for months). 

Today she told me that for the past year there has been a lot less energy in our conversations and she doesnâ€™t know how to start them. I was diagnosed and medicated one year ago this month. I get where sheâ€™s coming from, because I have become less manic, but itâ€™s really starting to feel like that energy was what she liked most about me, and it is kinda breaking my heart. 

She doesnâ€™t ask me about my personal life. She expects me to be excited about everything, and always making plans for big adventures. I know that weâ€™ve grown up, I know we canâ€™t expect the energy we had as kids, but I feel used. Or that the behaviors I donâ€™t have as much of are what matter most about me.

I will also embarrassingly admit that prior to me experiencing this, I thought that weight gain because of medications was potentially over exaggerated. I was fucking wrong, guys. Iâ€™m sorry for being ignorant.

The bad? I have gone from 140 pounds to 165 pounds. Before meds, I would eat one serving at every main meal, snacking very little to none at all throughout the day. I felt comfortable and rarely felt hungry. I was happy with my body and maintained the weight, but obviously very bipolar and dangerous.

Now? I am simply ravenous with food. I am never satiated. I will eat two servings of every meal and still feel like I can go for more. Of course, I WILL go for more. I often eat until I feel sick. It is insane! I have tried adjusting my eating habits to pre-meds many times, but I genuinely feel like I am starving myself.

I am curious if the hospital I have gone to is just an outlier, or whether it is due to where I live, or if other people have similar experiences.  Can you answer the questions below regarding your inpatient stay(s)?**  


1. ***Was your stay during a period of time when COVID was prevalent?***  ***^(This might change answers about visitor permissions etc.)***  
2. ***Were you admitted voluntarily or involuntarily?***
3. ***What country did you receive care in?***
4. ***Did you have access to a mental health advocate if you wanted one?***
5. ***How long were you in the hospital?***
6. ***Were you forced to accept treatment, or could you refuse?***
7. ***Were you able to keep your own clothes, or were they taken from you?***
8. ***Were you able to keep your cell phone?  What about other electronics (e.g. laptop)?***
9. ***Were you permitted visitors?***
10. ***Did you have regular time outside?***
11. ***How often did you see a psychiatrist?***

My answers, as an example, are below:

&amp;#x200B;

1. ***Was your stay during a period of time when COVID was prevalent?***  ***^(This might change answers about visitor permissions etc)*****^(.)**  One stay was prior to COVID, the other three were during COVID.
2. ***Were you admitted voluntarily or involuntarily?***  Involuntarily
3. ***What country did you receive care in?***  Canada
4. ***Did you have access to a mental health advocate if you wanted one?***  Yes, at no cost to me
5. ***How long were you in the hospital?***  The shortest stay was 2 weeks, longest was 7 or 8 weeks.
6. ***Were you forced to accept treatment, or could you refuse?***  I could refuse
7. ***Were you able to keep your own clothes, or were they taken from you?***  Kept my own clothes.  
8. ***Were you able to keep your cell phone?  What about other electronics (e.g. laptop)?***  Kept all, but my charging cords were temporarily taken from me
9. ***Were you permitted visitors?***  Prior to COVID I had unlimited visitors, although they encouraged them to come in the evening. During COVID the restrictions were really strict.  There were periods where no visitors were allowed, and eventually I was allowed one visitor.

"I know giving antidepressants for bipolar is controversial, and people with bipolar should, if ever, only use them with a strong mood stabilizer. I have had antidepressant induced mania with Effexor in the past which was horrible, but I wasnâ€™t diagnosed at the time and on a concurrent mood stabilizer. 

Has anyone found an antidepressant combo that works well and hasnâ€™t caused you hypomania or mania? Iâ€™ve tried everything for the depression side of things (antipsychotics that are supposedly good for bipolar depression, bupropion, lamictal, lithium, modafinil, tms, ect), and the best I got was short term relief with ketamine therapy. Iâ€™m desperate because none of these have worked well especially over the long term.",bipolar_disorder

I am the worst at time management, but Iâ€™m hyper focused in certain things that I work from home (entrepreneur/hustler) so I make a living but maximizing those few good hours I have of productiveness.

Coffee makes me tired and do most stimulants. 

I have to run in the treadmill at night for a long time or workout 3 hrs a day to relax.

I have major insomnia. But I also have to take SSRI due to extreme mood swings during period.

"So I've been diagnosed Bipolar I since 2015 and in 2021 I finally got on a medication regimen that works. 

I've been on lamotrigine constantly, (300mg daily) 
but I've been on Lithium for only the past year. Because I'm keto, my body processes the lithium a bit differently than others and it's been quite the trial and error to figure out how to dose it out. 

I've found out the hard way not to take them together.


I'm prescribed 300mg 2x daily Lithium, but I only take it roughly every other night (mostly out of fear for more violent nausea) 

However, I'm trying to establish a real schedule. 

Can anyone with Lithium experience share anything they know that might make this adjustment easier?

that workout alone fixed my sleep, my eating, gave me confidence and a healthy routine, something to look forward to. meds knock me out at night now and send me right to bed because i come home tired. cooking is so much more enjoyable and i love buying groceries now!

+ my psych increased my mood stabilizer dose at around the same time i started, so that could be a huge factor to my overall well-being. 

iâ€™m also taking my meds more seriously and always taking my pills on time, i used to play around with the timing to stay up late and â€œstretchâ€ the mania, because i struggled to accept my diagnosis.

i try to keep my chin up and not think of it this way, instead i make myself believe that I did all the work myself. i canâ€™t be hypomanic! my sleep is good, iâ€™m not impulsively spending money, iâ€™m not deep cleaning my place everyday!

Snuggling while watching someone funny while my husband strokes my hair sounds a hell of a lot better than flopping around naked pretending to have a good time.

Recently I have been having back to back rapid cycling, and I feel like Iâ€™m deteriorating. My biggest trigger seems to be my BPD, which has been very bad recently. I just got out of a very deep depressive episode and I literally shot straight into a manic episode. I start a new job next week, but I feel incredibly unstable. I was put on geodon and Zoloft and I see my therapist weekly. I donâ€™t know what to do, I wasnâ€™t given any information from my psych other than â€œdonâ€™t kys and take your pillsâ€.

"I have been always a leader. I started my first web development company when I was 15. I dropped out of my college and started a successful product company and things were really great until I turned 27. It took a hard turn with my bipolar. I became manic and spend all of my savings plus my company account balance on stupid lifestyle things when I hit for the first time.

I became obsessed with an employee girl in my office and did some stupid things to impress her. I didn't even notice her before my mania. I became a laughing stock in front of my employees. I was admitted to a mental institute during my first manic episode at 27. This continued for another 4 more times and each time I lost a lot of money and employees and loyal partners until they all resigned from my company and I was forced to shut down my business and go back to my parent's place and a huge suppression hit me during the covid lockdown.

Now, after 3 years, I gained some confidence and decided to join a software company as a project manager. Regret hits me hard. Really hard. When the owners of my current company video called and give me first introductions, My heart was crashing down as I never worked for anyone. Now I'm sitting in a cubicle, one of many employees, looking at my watch thinking when can I leave the place and go home.

"i was diagnosed with bipolar 2 around a year ago and i feel like even in that time my experience with bipolar has constantly shifted and changed.

the way my mania presents itself is almost that it makes me a normal person??? iâ€™ll go out a lot, become an over-achiever in my college classes, and be super confident in myself. 

this makes it hard when i come down because it was like almost having a glimpse of what being a normal person was like. 

however, when i started to feel depressed, it almost feels good??? like thank god iâ€™m feeling something that feels so normal and so much more like me. itâ€™s terrible and at times, i feel unbearable, undefinable sadness. but it feels almost like home

sometimes i worry that im making this whole thing up in my head and that im just faking it. i feel at constant war with myself and convince myself on a daily basis that im a shitty person whoâ€™s faking my problems to keep the attention on me. 

i sometimes feel like im going insane. like i have no control over my own brain. my sense of reality becomes so distorted that i canâ€™t even tell if im really feeling something or just making it up in my own head

The only difference is that this morning I took 200mg of lamictal up from 150mg. I don't have to be awake until 9:15am to make it to work so I still have 5 hours or so if I go to sleep right now.

"This summer I had a really intense manic episode caused by a mix of genetics, home stressors and a bad reaction to stimulant medication for my ADHD. 

I ended up in the psych ward for a couple of weeks, where I was given olanzapine and valproic acid. While it worked well for the first couple of weeks while I was still manic/hypomanic, once I got to my baseline (which has always been moderately depressed), my life took a turn for the worse. 

My brain feels like itâ€™s filled with sand. I canâ€™t remember conversations I had 5 minutes ago. I wake up everyday feeling like I was hit by a truck, and I have no motivation to do anything. Most days end up being spent in bed trying to pinpoint where it all went wrong. 

I told my psychiatrist about my adverse reaction to my medications, and heâ€™s agreed to get me off of these and try some new ones, but it looks like that will end up taking months to lower everything so Iâ€™m completely off of it.

"I've been bipolar II since about 18. Medication somehow makes it worse and therapy is...expensive. 

I don't know many other people with this illness, but everyone else's hypomanic states makes them more...volatile (which I know is normal.)

For me, I feel like it's the only time people like me and want to be around me. I'm willing to forgo sleep to fill whatever impulse desires my brain comes up with. I don't go out of my way to hurt those close to me, but the god complex makes me want to be almost worshipped in a consensual manner. People have even stated they love it when I'm hypomanic.

But with every high comes lows that are not worth it. My depressive phases leave me completely stuck in bed. I can't even watch tv. Recently there has been so much trauma in my life that I'm at the lowest I've been since 2017. I thought I was healing. I thought I was getting better. The temporary happiness is not worth it. 

This is also where I lose friendships. They don't understand my depression is different from there's. They don't get that my absolute best is just being able to shower. They can function on their depression, while I can barely exist. I've lost so much because I've been ""too sad"" for people. 

Now I know a lot of those people who have been cut off are toxic, but that's another thing. I don't have a support system. I try to make friends to develolp one, as it's essential to healing.

"I started dating someone Iâ€™ve known online for a year about a month ago. I confessed to them and we started off strong talking for hours on end and immediately planning â€œdatesâ€ so we could set time aside for each other while our schedules were getting busier during the summer. Now that Iâ€™ve been working more recently, I started crashing hard from the high I felt when they reciprocated my feelings. I kept repeating myself to them that I felt like they and all my friends hated me, even though when I was thinking rationally, I knew it wasnâ€™t true. It doesnâ€™t help that they first confessed to someone else in our friend group, and ever since I felt like I was a lesser alternative. They seemed to hang out more while I stayed away sometimes because I was anxious. Even now I still let it get to me even though itâ€™s probably just an irrational insecurity. Thatâ€™s during depression. During manic episodes, I start getting obsessive thinking patterns. I get jealous when they talk to others more or donâ€™t react to me when I text them. Iâ€™ve always felt like the odd one out in the group, but this is the worst itâ€™s been. I want to be better for them. I want to be at a point where I donâ€™t have these toxic patterns and can really connect with them again.",bipolar_disorder

Does lamictal help with depression? I struggle with fatigue and Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that my baseline is slightly depressed. Iâ€™m on latuda which has helped prevent severe episodes but I still have high functioning constant fatigue. My doctor is thinking about adding an antidepressant but Iâ€™m honestly kind of scared to take one because of bad experiences in the past/side effects. Iâ€™m think I might ask her about lamictal bc Iâ€™ve a lot of positive comments about it on here. Does lamictal help with your depression and energy levels???,bipolar_disorder

 What's been going well for you lately?,bipolar_disorder
"So my psychologist I have been seeing for a short period of time (maybe 1-2 months) said I am definitely not bipolar. This came as a shock because I have been diagnosed as bipolar 1 for many years. She says because I am not completely unhinged, getting arrested or hospitalized long term or living on disability, it is an impossibility that I am bipolar. I mean I go through very high functioning short periods. Then I want to die horribly. Then I blink and Iâ€™m spending money I do not have, Iâ€™ve got a bunch of random new hobbies laying around the house, I am almost impossible to talk to. 
Should I be looking into a second opinion or is this information correct?",bipolar_disorder
"I have bad memory and pretty often forget to bring up major issues even during therapy, what are the bigest ones they need to know about so i dont end up forgetting them in the middle of talking to the doctor?

"I am on 15mg of Olanzapine. I assumed that I would deal with restless legs at night, I did when I was on Quetiapine. 
BUT NO. 
I fall asleep fine, no restlessness, but the next day, LORD, my entire body is restless, I need to keep going, if I sit my muscles feel tight and my skin is crawling, I havenâ€™t been able to sit and enjoy a video game or a movie in the past week.

"Hi all,

I'm a baby bipolar, meaning that I caught it shortly after onset at 23. A simple 50mg dose of Seroquel saved my life -- killed my aggression, irritability, delusions, alcohol addiction, depressive episodes, 80% of my mania. BUT I was still anxious, meaning I couldn't complete tasks at work. This has been going on my whole life, and my intelligence saved me (graduated from a top school, have a good job now.) I got on pre-gabatin, and now, I can face my tasks and finish them, I can eat normally instead of staring at the food, I no longer compulsively listen to music. Bipolar and anxiety are often seen together. 

What are your experiences with anxiety + bipolar? Do you take pre-gabatin? 

Fear: I've heard axiety meds are bad for you? While Seroquel feels like a match made in heaven, I can feel that pre-gabatin is a drug, like it doesn't feel like /me/, but it gets the job done.",bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™ve had 3 major manic episodes each being more intense and longer than the last. Itâ€™s been a year and a half since my last episode  and I still ruminate about the events of my last episode. Some days less than others but every once in a while it gets so bad that I feel suicidal. 

My last episode I :
1. quit my job
2. got evicted 
3. experienced erotomania for musical artists in a field I want to go into
4. Was hospitalized twice after getting arrested, thankfully no jail (not related to the above) 
5. Got kicked out of my moms house and she got a temporary restraining order from me because I threatened her (thankfully dropped and not permanent ) 
6. Streamed on twitch during my episode and people in the industry I wanted to go in saw a lot of the delusion and a side of myself that even I donâ€™t recognize. 

Thereâ€™s a lot more I did but those are the things I struggle with the most. It was wild, traumatic and I still canâ€™t get past it. My main gripe is that Iâ€™ll never be accepted in the music industry because of what happened and will face a lot of backlash if I restart my musical pursuit. Almost like I ended my career before it even started.

Iâ€™m seeking therapy and am on meds that work. Overall my life has improved tremendously but the shame still weighs on me. Everyone of importance in my life , especially my mother, have forgiven me twofold. But, for some reason itâ€™s not enough for me to move on. 

How do cope with the actions done during your episodes? How do you get past your shame or guilt?",bipolar_disorder
"I go to a substance use iop and I have about 7 months sober but I was so close to relapsing this holiday weekend. When they asked me why I said it's because I feel so shitty and I have no motivation to do better. 

I always think about dying or about self harm but I have no intention to harm or kill myself. When I told them this they asked me if I have ever been to an inpatient mental health facility but they didn't say I needed to go or anything.

I've been feeling depressed for a minute and I started new meds a week ago but I feel like nothing will get better, and if it does get better, i will eventually just be sad again. 

I think about going to a mental health facility because I can maybe have a better chance at feeling less depressed there but I dont really want to go at the same time.",bipolar_disorder

"I was dx'd bp1 last November. I relate strongly to the DSM criteria, I've read numerous books on the subject and found a lot I related to in them too, my wife thinks my diagnosis is accurate, my best friend thinks my diagnosis is accurate--yet I can't stop doubting the diagnosis.

"We dated for two months, mostly long distance. He was diagnosed last November, type II. He said he realized he wasn't as far along in treatment as he thought he was, and that he wasn't as ready for a relationship as he thought he was. And that it wouldn't be fair to me.

Iâ€™m still working on balancing my meds correctly but Iâ€™ve been doing okay considering, Iâ€™m putting a lot of effort into eating healthy and gaining weight that I lost. I still have plenty of bad days that I think none of it is worth it and Iâ€™d rather just lay down and die instead of try, but I keep picking myself back up. No one else can do it, it has to be me.

"Iâ€™m on 375mg of Divalrpoex Sodium with 0.5mg of Clonazepam all at night. I canâ€™t seem to take more without it causing a deeper depression feeling (like dark) or sometimes something like suicidal ideation. Iâ€™ve been battling a place of depression for at least 6 months. I tried 20mg of Latuda and by a week into the month three I was a zombie, lost words like shoe, and the nightmares were so real I could not sometimes manage to get them out of my head the next day. It took me 2 weeks for the Latuda side effects to abate and I took a bit of extra clonazepam those few days in there to help with the waves of anxiety but I think it did start to make me feel more depressed. The family doctor wants to try 10mg Vyvanse which is the lowest dose and see if it helps with the anxiety and depression. What comes with all of that is agoraphobia which compound the depression and the anxiety. Itâ€™s a bad circle. I took one Vyvanse on the weekend and had a weird cluster type headache move around from the back of my head up to my temples. I wondered if it was interfering with the divalproex and doing a migraine type thing. Anyway I know you canâ€™t tell me what to do or take (only my doctor can) but can someone please help me who takes divalproex and let me know whatâ€™s helped them with the depression? I feel like Iâ€™m never going to get out of this place and Iâ€™m not wanting to start relying again on clonazepam to get me through the day although pretty soon Iâ€™m going to have to and that I always find eventually doesnâ€™t help and backfires.",bipolar_disorder
"I've just been diagnosed for the second time with bipolar. But part of me still thinks I don't have it. I was on ssris for ocd for about a decade with no problems until I had a manic episode that landed me in the psych ward. I was put on antipsychotics after that but stopped taking them because I felt fine and didn't think I had bipolar. This is because I only had one episode that was mostly psychosis and less mania. I also didn't get depressed afterwards. It's been almost a year and I haven't had an episode since, even without meds. But recently I saw a new psychiatrist because my ocd and anxiety have gotten a lot worse and she said I still have bipolar. I guess I believe her but it's still hard for me to buy considering I've only had one episode and no depression. I kinda feel like an imposter.",bipolar_disorder

However this is the first person I have really dated since getting my diagnostic that I am bipolar. So I am unsure how to talk about it  and when is the right time to tell him.

Yesterday I said that I have a doctors appointment and he was asking what it was about and I was vague just saying that it was a checkup. Well it was my therapist appointment. He asked about it again so I was planning on maybe just ripping off the band-Aid and telling him. 

I am just so scared that he will be turned off or run away from me after I tell him this.

"TRIGGER WARNING

he lives in another state. i cut contact with him after he repeatedly disrespected my boundaries and then got shitty and manipulative with me when i was trying to work through my disorder i had only just found out i had. i was going through a psychotic breakdown and he was trying to swoop in like a white knight and take advantage of me, like he did his exes, while under the guise of just being there as a friend.

i told him not to come and he got shitty with me about it. which is when i cut contact. my mental health was more important than dealing with that bs.

he showed up at my house a year later to tell me he's getting married to his old ex gf who lives in my torn. 

i thought to warn her about him but figured he spun spun his lies already and she would just think i was jealous or something. 

i was glad he found a different target.  thought that would be the last from him. 

now another year later he suddenly msgs me.  apologizing for overstepping boundaries many years ago.  something he apologized for already. ignored the other big reasons why i cut him off.

i didn't recognize his #. it was local. all who it is and when he says it was him, i felt sick. i never want to see him again. i didn't like that he was nearby. i felt unsafe. i never responded

that weekend he called each night and texted each afternoom. saying he just wanted to talk but i didn't have to and he understood if i didn't. each time it sounded like he was just going to leave it at that yet he would still keep trying to contact me. 

then the final night, he called me.  ignored it still.  then he msgs me saying he's checking out a bar near my home.  it's in walking distance. I'm like oh fck no here we go.

he texts some hrs later saying he's going back to his home state this month and will be at the bar if i want to meet up and just talk.

mind you he's been married for 6 months.  i don't understand why he's doing this now or at all.

i ignore it,  dreading hearing a knock at my door at some point in the night. 

then hours later he blows up my phone from a different local #. then he texts from that number with some sob story he spun and asking to crash at my place for an hr.

i was like you cannot be fucking serious. i looked good wife up on Facebook and told her what he was doing and that he must be out his mind to think this is okay and to please get him under control. 

i didn't tell her i felt uncomfortable and unsafe. i didn't tell her the details of our past.  i didn't warn her about them.  i just told her about how he has shown up at my place uninvited and told me they were getting married a year after i told him not to contact me. i told her he suddenly contacted me this week and is now blowing up my phone  asking to crash at my place despite me ignoring him.

she acts like she upset with *me* tells me to just please tell him i don't want anything to do with him.  i told her i been told him that the last time we spoke.

i just stopped responding to her.  her response was odd.

then the next day she msgs me about her ""issue"" with me. she tells me i have issues and I'm a liar and need to grow up and get my mental health together and admit what I've done wrong... i tell her to grow up and don't contact me with this childish bs. i didn't contact her to start drama.  i contacted her because she needed to know what he was doing and i needed him to stop.

it was the safest and best route of actin i could think of. i didn't want to contact him and open that door and give him hope. police weren't going to do anything. what else was i to do??

but yes he apparently already told her her his sob story about why we don't talk anymore.  he already spun his lies. covered his tracks in case i ever contacted her.

and he already told her he wanted to speak with my in a public place for an hr. probably for ""therapy "" purposes. he said he was back in therapy.

but that's why he blew my phone up and asked to crash from a DIFFERENT #. so he could claim that want him. 

he told her he doesnt want me and never did with my crazy issues. he made me out to be a serial cheaterv who doesnt take responsibility for my actions. i have cheated but not with him and I've owned up to every time I've cheated and I've made amends with my ex. 

this guy? i didn't cheat with him. the second time we met in person, he took advantage of me.  HE climbed into MY bed while i was sick and exhausted and medicated.  passing out in my own bed while he was in his. 

i don't even remember anything after him nibbling my ear. i cringe just typing that. i feel disgusted.  for year i felt that i had cheated because i couldn't believe he would take advantage of me.  we were such good friends.  i trusted him so much.

I've never told my ex about it. and honestly,  if he was to know,  I'd say i cheated rather than i was taken advantage of because i feel like he would feel even worse and so much more anger about the latter. because this guy pretended to be our friend. pretended to care.  he only cares about himself. 

I'm shaking writing this.  he had his wife tellimg me that i wanted it and that i cheated and that i need to own up to it and that he was only seeing to my needs while i was sick. CLIMBING INTO MY BED IS NOT SEEING TOO MY NEEDS WHILE I'M SICK LIKE HOLY SHIT WHAT EXACTLY DID HE TELL HER.

I blocked her because I'm not wasting my energy or subjecting myself to that.  i already know fighting is futile.

i could go on.  if you're interested in full back story feel free to ask.  i need to get this off my chest, despite how messy and chaotic it may come out",bipolar_disorder
"Thereâ€™s a girl with bipolar II that has developed a strong hate for me out of nowhere. Whenever she sees me her eyes look angry, she slapped me yesterday and got me banned from the coffee shop she works at. She doesnâ€™t treat anyone else like this. Before she was angry she was really sweet, kinda flirtatious and loved being around me. Seems it did a 180 out of the blue.

This behavior is bizarre to me since I respect her space and weâ€™ve had a lot of good times together. Weâ€™ve gotten into a couple of heated arguments but she never seemed so angry until a couple days ago where she canâ€™t stand me.

The only reasons I can think of that she may be holding onto:

-When we first met I asked her out then cancelled the date because I didnâ€™t feel she was as interested.

-we argued at work a couple times

-I donâ€™t give her much attention

-I unknowingly made a joke that really offended her, instantly apologized.


Could bipolar be the cause of the behavior? Any speculations what it may be? Iâ€™m just trying to understand it, seems unfair. My only option now is to stop seeing her which is unfortunate because sheâ€™s a great person whenâ€™s she not acting like this",bipolar_disorder

Now.. I get how this sounds, but for a moment let me indulge in this.. I miss the excitement, thrills, and endless creativity I had in so many hypomanic episodes. I miss getting jazzed about anything small, I miss having the drive to learn and pursue.. really random things. For a moment I need to express that. 

There is no way I want to go back to dealing with episode after episode after episode, and theres no way I want to feel that bottoming out depression again, but I do miss those shiny hypomanic moments. Sometimes lately, I've felt bored by things I love, and I have just felt bored with life, which is a very uncommon thing for me. I can't help but think that boredom is attributed to the loss of those upswings.

But I donâ€™t necessarily enjoy the idea of an IUD but I know thatâ€™s the only way to avoid hormones while having birth control. Iâ€™m stuck on what to do, me and my boyfriend have been fine using condoms so far but I want to have extra protection just in case we try something stupid.

I've been in this industry for 10 years with no issues, and even am a professional engineer (which requires you to be mentally healthy to make decisions). My bipolar has been a hurdle, but I've never missed more than a day of work every few months because of it; my company does not even know about it. 

My new by-the-rules manager has decided my group should be subjected to the DOT's Drug and Alcohol testing program (extremely stringent test levels, testing up to four times a year, any medication exceptions must be approved by the DOT client, your doctor has to write a note explaining that they know your job requirements and still are prescribing you these medicines) because we MIGHT be on-site more than three times a year. 

My medications light up an at-home drug test like a Christmas tree. I tried explaining to my manager that some people may not be able to pass even if they are legal and that I had concerns about being added. I told them I was promised I would not have to participate in the DOT program when I took the position, but he said that a) I should talk to HR if I had a problem and b) that he didn't see how I could do my job if I couldn't be on-site when necessary. 

The DOT test results get sent to future DOT-related employers. And I REALLY don't need everyone knowing about my bipolar. I currently take Klonopin, Trintellix, Lamictal, and full-spectrum CBD.

Every single time I get a job as long as I've worked( this even applies to school) has been doomed to failure because I'll get burned out and then the panic attacks start. Sometimes it takes a year, sometimes a few months, and this last attempt only a week into employment. I tried to get a work from home customer service job against my best judgment because it was an excellent opportunity, but shocker, I went south in record timing.

 My dad told me to just take anxiety meds and push through it but he doesn't understand how close I'm getting to \*really\* hurting myself. The thought of forcing myself into situations that cause me panic attacks makes me want to die, and the problem is that means there's almost nothing I can do for work. EVERYTHING work related makes me anxious, I can't even do something I enjoy without quickly getting burnt out and clawing at myself. The one career I was finally able to hold down a job in for more than a year is too tough on me physically and was damaging my body, and now what can I do?

"Hey everyone. I just wanted to share something and see if anyone could relate.

So Iâ€™ve been stable on my meds for over 5 years. Itâ€™s been absolutely wonderful, but I still struggle with symptoms. I know Iâ€™m never going to reach the point where they fully go away, and Iâ€™m okay with that. But Iâ€™ve noticed that other people tend to treat me like Iâ€™m not bipolar, and itâ€™s become a problem.

My husband in particular has a tendency to assume I can do things just as easily as he can. I think he forgets I struggle with things until he sees me meltdown. Then he remembers. But he forgets again and itâ€™s just kind of this cycle. Even my mom, who is also bipolar, talks to me about her symptoms. I try to relate to her, and she insists that I donâ€™t understand. That Iâ€™m not like her. It really hurts when she says that, because I have absolutely been through the same sorts of situations and pain. Itâ€™s frustrating.

At work itâ€™s even worse. Because my illness is invisible, I canâ€™t have symptoms at all or I could get fired. Iâ€™m pretty sure that is why I lost my last job. I was having a really hard time while trying to switch medication. My symptoms started getting worse and I think my work just assumed it was a personal failing of some kind. Even though they knew I was bipolar.

And tbh the worst part of all of this is that some people get angry at me for having these problems. Like Iâ€™m stable, I should be grateful and not complain about very real issues I still struggle with. Symptoms I still have. My mom sometimes guilts me about it. My husband has been getting better about this, but it still happens sometimes. Iâ€™m justâ€¦.so damn tired. All the time. And I just wanted to know if anyone else could relate or if Iâ€™m completely alone in this.",bipolar_disorder

When I read about the connection between bipolar disorder and cognitive impairment, it was like the dots connected themselves for me. Iâ€™ve been put on Adderall for symptoms of adhd when Iâ€™m pretty sure these symptoms Iâ€™m going through are really cognitive impairments. I struggle severely with memory problems (to the point where itâ€™s seriously embarrassing), canâ€™t concentrate on ANYTHING, canâ€™t get a task done, have difficulty understanding when people speak to me, etc etc. I definitely think anyone interested in this should do the research because I found tons of interesting information just from a quick google search and it really put my mind at peace knowing this is something other people suffer through.",bipolar_disorder

"Two days ago I was at a bday party and it was a really nice place, we had food and some drinks. 
I had the same amount of beers as my boyfriend but I became really drunk, to the point of not remembering anything. 
I skipped the bday party apparently and went to meet some friends in a bar. The problem was that I was completely out of it. 
They said I was almost robbed like a lot of times, I wasnâ€™t making any sense, I was talking and annoying a lot of people around the bar, I lost my favorite jacket, and I woke up in my grandmaâ€™s house, not even knowing why I went there. I donâ€™t recall any of it, I even feel I walked around my city completely alone, donâ€™t even know how Iâ€™m still here.
Iâ€™m feeling awful, I want to die, I hate being like this. 
I hate not remembering anything, my intrusive thoughts makes me feel crazy, like I would hurt someone or do something I would never do. 
I hate how my brain is wired, I want to stop drinking, but all my friends and family do is eat and drink a lot.
The problem is Iâ€™m not like them, Iâ€™m bipolar and I have really bad OCD. 
I just hate how every time I give up and be like â€œIâ€™m just gonna have two beersâ€ and end up completely out of my mind. I feel like I need to drink or get tipsy to feel better, but most of the times I lost control.
I do drugs occasionally, but Iâ€™m always really drunk already and just do them because Iâ€™m already out of it.
The problem for me is literally the alcohol, it makes me feel awful, I feel like I become a completely different person.
Today is the third day I canâ€™t get out of my house, Iâ€™m scared of myself, like a did a really shitty thing to someone but I canâ€™t even know.
Sometimes I wish I died right there and then, drunk, so I wouldnâ€™t even know. 
I donâ€™t have no one to talk to, the friends I met that day are not so close to me, and Iâ€™m tired of venting to my boyfriend, I donâ€™t want to bore him. 
I decided to stop drinking but for that I canâ€™t see my friends. I know Iâ€™m different from them, they can do the things I want but for some fucking reason my brain is fucked up. 
Sorry, I needed to vent, I canâ€™t sleep properly and just want to lay around all day.

"I am a 27F diagnosed with bipolar and being treated in the Netherlands. I was first diagnosed when I was 25 and given 10mg abilify, but i did not do well on it. It was a very negative experience for me so when I was diagnosed again here and the subject of medication came up I really advocated for myself and wanted to start on a lower dose and be in good communication with my doctors. 
Itâ€™s been going well, but I was wondering if anyone had similar experiencesâ€¦
I have pretty bad anxiety and what I notice with the 50mg seroquel is it helps me sleep and slows my racing thoughts which nearly eliminates the anxiety and feels fucking amazing. However, I notice that I get very hyper when it starts to wear off. Also if I miss/skip a dose I will not sleep. Maximum 2-3 hours of sleep if I donâ€™t take it. Itâ€™s seldom that I donâ€™t take my medicine because I know what will happen, Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone else experiences this with a low dose of seroquel or any antipsychotic really. 

Im also looking to increase my dosage soon. I canâ€™t hold a job and Iâ€™m starting to realize itâ€™s closely linked to my diagnosis (look at me being self aware ðŸ˜…).

"Trigger warning - suicide and abortion 
Sorry this might be a long one, just need to rant and find some understanding 

I've had a really crappy time over that last few months. I took an overdose this April and ended up in kidney failure. It tore me apart knowing that this absolutely destroyed my partner and I swore I'd never do it again.

A couple of weeks later, I found out I was pregnant. We disputed about what we should do and it led to my what I believe to be my first full manic episode. I almost ruined my relationship and scared the people around me. I woke up one day and it was like the fog had lifted and I was left with all the things I'd said and done. Ultimately, we decided to go through with the abortion.

Now, I feel like I have to hold myself together for a few reasons. I don't feel like i can trust anyone due to what happened during my manic episode, the delusions about my family were incredible and some of the things said to me I've not recovered from. I also feel like I can't let my partner down again after what happened with the kidney failure - I broke him. I am absolutely crushed about the abortion, the baby was wanted but it wasn't feasible right now. I can't even talk about it, it's so painful. And to top it off I've decided now is the right time to go back to work because I just can't cope with sitting around waiting for this next breakdown.

So much has happened these last few months that I feel like if I stop then I will explode. I have to hide how I'm feeling so I can be destructive without people knowing because it hurts them too much. I'm trying to press on but I'm falling apart on the inside and can't tell anyone. I just don't trust them with my feelings and I can't deal with hurting them anymore. I am resisting these urges but it's bloody difficult. I'm trying to be a better version of myself but I don't know how much of it is true.

"hi. i'm sorry if it's off-topic or sounds silly.

i don't have bipolar disorder. well, the chance of me actually having it is the same as for any other undiagnosed person, so i'll settle on that. i don't have it.

the thing is, my mother had always been fixated on taking me to various psychologists and doctors. she keeps making up stories and facts, and, what i've noticed recently, heavily projecting, and the doctors don't mind as long as they get paid. i don't care about what she says at this point. she seems to be aware that what she says is not true, but i'm not really sure about that part. she really does have a noticeable problem with lying, to be fair.

on that matter, i'm still underage.

anyway, recently (a few months back) she took me to another psychologist (what my mother called her, likely someone else), the lady obviously had seen all of the previous 'diagnosed' stuff. we then had to move shortly after and didn't finish anything with that psychologist. there was supposed to be another session.

anyway, today she told me that i'm in the process on getting diagnosed with bipolar disorder and that i'll have to get it finalized and take medicine. knowing her, she'll keep pestering me about that for a while. i don't want to to argue with her as i'm trying another approach to handling her (and her mother, who is arguably worse), by offering minimum, for my standards, friendliness.

i don't know what medicine specifically she's trying to get me prescribed. it's not much specific, but is there any medicine for bipolar disorder that can make a major impact on my health? is there anything in particular i should look out for? or is it better avoid taking anything at all to not to risk it?

One was on a work trip, I was in a subway with a new friend and a subway was coming towards us, and I had a real-time fully-formed suicidal thought, like a â€œwhat ifâ€. It made me uncomfortable because it felt like more of a physical feeling than just a â€œwhateverâ€ intrusive thought.

I decided to respond bc why tf does he keep dming me about my mania posts. He tried to â€œhelp meâ€ then asked me for nudes. I then yelled at him bc who tf does that. He said he has bipolar and is manic but thatâ€™s not an excuse to sexually harass other sick ppl. He said he was sorry for triggering me bc who tf tried to trigger ppl that are manic. I yelled at him because who SEXUALLY HARASSES PEOPLE IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT IF THEY KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE MANIC AND DELUSIONAL.

He went through my account and looked at all of my posts and kept trying to talk about them.

The guy who did it had a throw away account but Iâ€™m sure heâ€™s still out there and made a new one. Idk if there are anything the mods can do but I just thought Iâ€™d make people aware. That there are sick fucks trying to pray on manic women.

"Early in my lithium treatment i switched from the former to the latter because the capsules led to way more nausea. My psych accidentally gave me the capsules again, and i wasnt too concerned at first. 

But that night i woke up at 4 am and had a 9/10 panic attack. Shaking, tongue siezed up, rapid breathing feeling like I needed to run from a lion. It is not a common panic attack for me to have.

Wondering if this is a coincidence or if anyone else has had this issue?",bipolar_disorder
"I understand that sometimes the little mayoclinic articles donâ€™t always accurately depict what itâ€™s like to experience certain illnesses. I have been diagnosed with PTSD and reading about it online is vastly different than what I experienced in my life.

 Iâ€™m visiting my psychiatrist soon to see about bipolar disorder because I canâ€™t think of anything else I would have, but in the interim I wanted to hear other peoples experiences. 

 From little online articles, it says the mood changes occur for weeks at a time, so weeks of mania and weeks of depression. For my experience, my mood shifts rapidly and savagely and constantly, one minute Iâ€™m so happy to be alive and I LOVE everyone and I can cry genuine happy tears because I hear a song I like or see something pretty, which is all very out of character for me. A couple hours later Iâ€™ll be so down, questioning why Iâ€™m even trying anymore, why is life such a waste, or otherwise Iâ€™ll feel extremely guilty for absolutely everything like Iâ€™m ruining my life and everyone elseâ€™s. I overreact a lot according to other people. Iâ€™m not sure why. I have impulsivity but never gamble. I spend a lot at one time and highly regret it later but never more money than I have and I feel more in control of that than any of my emotions.

 Aside from that Iâ€™ve struggled with psychosis on and off for a couple months. Thatâ€™s completely new to me and I have no idea whatâ€™s caused it. 

 Iâ€™d like to hear your experience and when you knew you needed help. What itâ€™s like for you, how you cope every day. Does your medication help? Did getting help improve your interpersonal relationships as much as you hoped it would?",bipolar_disorder
"I love my boyfriend very much. But lithium makes it hard to actively feel that emotion. When I'm off it intermittently to release myself from the side effects, my emotions for him pour in like a leaky faucet.

I think about my future with him. I sob wildly at the thought of losing or hurting him. 

But on the otherside of the coin, depending on whatever mood swing I'm  in, I might also become intensely self abosrbant and hypersexual (never to the point of cheating though). 

When I'm  on lithium, the relationship itself is stable, but I dont think about him much, and sometimes it feels like my feelings for him arent really there. Memories of the times we shared together are faint. I cant even remember the first time holding his hand or the first time kissing him. And I wish I did. All of the memories I formed during my time on lithium are faint and dull.

I want to feel love. But I dont want to ruin our consistency and introduce volatility into his life.",bipolar_disorder
"So early last year I was diagnosed with bp2, my â€œlastâ€ hypomanic episode was early august last year since then Iâ€™ve had some really bad depressive episodes and stressors but have noticed no hypomanic states? Iâ€™m still depressed have been since I was young but the last few months Iâ€™ve been stable is the best way I can described it, like Iâ€™m somewhere in the middle of happy and sad. Iâ€™m not on any medication besides Seroquel 25mg for insomnia Iâ€™ve had bad experiences with lithium and anti depressants in the past. So I guess my question is can you not have hypomanic episodes or can your episodes become dormant and your stable? Or maybe Iâ€™ve been misdiagnosed Iâ€™ve always kinda thought I was adhd?

"Winter is changing into Spring which pretty much always throws my thinking into a bit of a chaos. So all I want to do when I'm not working is escape, so I try to watch television or movies, but here's the thing...everyone likes dramatic moments. Violence is the way every crap writer covers the fact that they can't come up with a decent story. And even if it's a comedy, people crave those tear-jerking stories about someone dying or breaking up with one another or moving away, etc. 

I mean...that's great for the zombies who have to have a ""very special cancer episode"" of whatever show they're watching to feel something, but I'm already good...thanks. 

Can't watch the news...God...have you seen the news lately? By lately I mean...decades? Perhaps centuries? I didn't watch the news a lot in 1801 so, I don't know...probably crappy reception anyway...

Documentaries about cute animals and breath-taking vistas of nature where some narrator says ""And it will all be gone within 20 years because of mankind!"". Well that's great...

Seriously...just want a cool story...

Like when someone could win a few million and by the end of the story they don't end up millionaires but they learn that happiness was within them right where they were all along.

WTF?!

It doesn't cost you anything. It's a work of fiction. Can't they discover true happiness AND have a million dollars?!?

"Hey there Reddit, sort of new to this. I'm just starting the process of being diagnosed and getting on meds and such. I've wanted to get help for a while but you know how it is.

Certain things in my life told me now was the the time. From my own observation of myself and research (I know Google isn't the most reliable source but it's all I've got rn) I suspect that I'm a least a little Bipolar and I'm almost 100% certain that I have some form ofasovhism as well.

I feel like this is a horrible combination. With Bipolar, you're already jumping between extreme ends of the spectrum. With Masochism thrown in there, it feels like an amplifier. When you're low, you think I feel like shit but I deserve to feel like shit so I won't make an effort to fix it. When you're high it's like I want to chase this feeling until I destroy myself...and I'm okay with that.

I'm not sure if it's just me or if it's more common than I realize. Does anyone else have experience with this? Or advice even?",bipolar_disorder
"So I got diagnosed bipolar in 2017 and was put on latuda which worked great until late 2021. Early 2022 I was out on lamictil and Prozac (I developed anxiety after getting off the latuda) but I've felt very... Weird since. I've worked up to 150mg and I'm constantly somewhat dizzy, lightheaded and kind of generally confused. The docs say this goes away after a time, but it's been weeks. I have another appointment on the 30th, and will bring up my concerns again, but I was wondering what other people's experiences were",bipolar_disorder
"Today, out of nowhere, I took the train alone for the first time in a long time. 

I generally avoid trains. When I was 16 and wasnt diagnosed with anything yet, I witnessed a woman jumped onto the train tracks from the platform. The train stopped a meter in front of her. As someone who's easily taumatized even through indirect experiences, athat is not something I could forget. I still remember that moment clear as day.

The last 4 weeks have the the longest that I have been stable in give or take 8 months. It has been amazing. However, for the past 3 days now, I've been have anticipating a really bad episode coming. This is right after I went to therapy last weekend. I tend to overthink a lot of stuff. I tend to over reflect and Hyperfixate on absurd ideas. I have harmed myself twice and thought of dying more often since. I've been feeling really bad about a lot of things. I can feel that my roomate, who is a part of my MHT as a monitor for me has been dealing with a lot of stress and I dont want to burden her with anything. 

Today, I decided to take the train with no particular reason in mind. While at the platform. I felt it. The urge to jump. The urge to just end it. I'm not scred to die. I don't feel bad for those i'll leave behind, they'll recover in 2 to 3 years or at most 5.  LOL. it was just a thought. I was so lost in fighting my brain not to jump in that I didn't realize how close I was to the warning line in the platform. The Guard had to whistle and it pulled me back to reality. I was so close to jumping in the tracks yet the train is nowhere in sight. I walked as far away from the edge of the platform as I can and waited for the train at a distance instead. 

Today, I didn't die. 
And I had the perfect chance to do so. 
BUT I DIDN'T. 
i'm proud of me. 
I might have the urge again in the future. 
but that urge didn't win today.",bipolar_disorder

Currently on the brink of homelessness with 2 kids. 
Got kicked out of our current place because in was friends with the landlords daughter and I went to a psych ward in Dec and she's hated me since and won't explain why, but then received and notice to vacate? 
So with a lack of options we moved into a terrable shack with my old man friend (creek water, barely a working shower, wasp nest at front door, snakes etc.
Anyway a while ago my old man friend told me he was in love with me, but he completely understands I don't want anything and isn't flirt y or pushy which is good. 
But the stress has been sending me towards a manic episode, and I suddenly want to sleep with him, I have 0 attraction to him (even stated to my friend if he was the last name alive I'd rather eat him and I'm vegetarian lol) 
But I've found myself doing sexualized behaviour around him, like walking around in my undies, giving him looks and even went as far as trying to uh get myself off in my bed across from him with thin walls, and made a little bit of noise. 
And I'm like wtf is wrong with me I don't want that and even if I was into its way to complicated his ex is already trying to force us out.

"I was diagnosed bipolar at 13, 8 months after witnessing my mother pass away and being forced to move into my abusive father's household.

Back then I had trouble sleeping, I felt impulsive, had mood swings, often felt like things weren't real, had delusions, and I had tried to end my life 3 or 4 times. Pretty basic bipolar indicators.

That being said, once I moved in with my now fiance (almost 5 yrs ago), all of these symptoms stopped even after backing off of meds. I'm not longer impulsive or self destructive, I feel like I have a healthy life style off meds that I can manage easily, I get good consistent sleep, my life feels vastly different and more calm. 

So my question is: Does this sound like a bipolar experience to you? Having a 5 year period of no antipsychotic meds and no signs of mania? My therapist wants to change my diagnosis from bipolar to CPTSD with dissociative subsets, but my psychiatrist is adamant on keeping the bipolar dx.

I'm assuming this is just normal (although I don't think I have a real sense of what normal it).

However, I find myself increasingly energised to the point where, for example, my driving starts to get reckless and I start paying a bit too much attention to Amazon and looking at crap I kid of want but can't afford - usually with my finger hovering over the 'buy now' button.

"Without getting into it too much, my Dad and I have had a very up and down relationship, one that has especially been tested with episodes before and sometimes after my diagnosis. We haven't always gotten along, and there's many times that I wish he would have reacted in a different way, or even wished that he would never have said things that were downright hurtful at the time. I guess that might be putting it lightly at times.

But, I know it couldn't have been easy going through everything I've put him through and this less-than-pleasant ride we've been on together. 

As time has passed, he has evolved into someone that I never thought would be as supportive as he has been.

Last night my Dad came from home a long day of work and he saw me in the kitchen. I had been trying to boost my mental and physical health earlier with a workout at the gym, but my attempt at that hadn't gone too well, and it was clear that overall I was just having a tough moment.

Later, he knocked on my door and came into my room and gently asked, ""why are you depressed?""

I told him that I wish there was an easy answer to that question.

He said, ""okay, well I have to go to bed now, but you know that I'm always hear if you need to talk.""

I know that there will never be a complete way for him to truly understand what it's like, or how he might be able to help at times, but that's okay. I don't expect him to always be able to.

All I know is that he is trying. And that's all that I will ever ask of him.

Hi there folks. I was diagnosed about a year from now and has been very hard to manage my life with this new thing floating around my head. Sometimes feel that everything i do is attributed with this feeling which is not the case. For example i get mad or irritated at a coffee shop and slam my fist on the table bc i canâ€™t control my anger is one. I just feel like i canâ€™t get in tune with my emotions which are normal and which are not. I also feel like another episode can happen bc I have been feeling kinda down lately and cant seem to control my emotions which has been pretty stressful.

One of the things on my mind is the nature of the universe. It sounds really dramatic written out, but itâ€™s more like a little thread I pull at occasionally. I only vaguely remember the double slit experiment from school, but I remember that photons can act as waves or particles based on whether theyâ€™re being observed. This made me think about rendering in computers and how things not being seen arenâ€™t rendered. This all makes me feel like weâ€™re in a simulation which doesnâ€™t bother me much, but I wish I new more about the double slit experiment to see how that logic holds up. I keep getting distracted by other things though and never bother to do more than think about it.

Thereâ€™s also sex. Iâ€™m talking to several guys right now, and thereâ€™s all the frustration and joy of dating and sex apps.

Books, movies, music. I am also rooting around various sites to look for more media about mental illness and bipolar. Also more academic readings. I was recently diagnosed I guess, and despite thinking it for a while, it feels weird.

And of course the familial relationships. I was happy my family didnâ€™t ask questions when I moved back in after taking some time off of school, but now I realize that everyone just kind of defaulted to me having a breakdown. It pisses me off, but I guess theyâ€™re kind of right to think that way.

Projects I want to do, things I want to learn. Right now itâ€™s web development because I donâ€™t know it and feel like I should.

"So after almost two years from one psych to another, I was properly diagnosed with Bipolar II in January 2022. Since I was on a therapeutic dose of Remeron 30mg, my Dr decided to continue the prescription and would stop if I feel a hypomania coming. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I've also discussed with my Dr that I have been struggling with attention issues my whole life and I do know that Bipolar does comorbid with ADD/ADHD. Although he hasn't rule that out, he is suggesting Abilify 2.5mg as an Atypical Anti Psychotic which helps with ADD symptoms (off label). 

it's really hard to distinguish my ADD symptoms with my BD2 symptoms. During depressive cycles, I'm just sluggish and can't focus nor start any tasks, whilst during my hypomanic phase I would decided to start \`1001 projects without ever completing them as I can get easily distracted with other tasks or I just feel like things are in a perfect state for me to even begin.

I do my best to get all my work done at school, and I do have a job as of recently, but everything else in my life is a complete mess. I'm a highly creative person, but I'm severely unstable. I know that I'm not built for life; it's never been natural for me. I'm incompetent, worthless, and I have basically no redeeming qualities (I'm not counting being polite, LOL). I've been screwing things up for as long as I can remember, and I find it very hard to understand other people, norms, and society in general. My highest achievement is my music being played on the radio, which my family does seem to appreciate, but it's absolutely nothing compared to my family's countless degrees and respectable careers/ goals. I tried to deny that I was a fuck up for a long time and tried to do things that would make me appear less of one, but at this point, I've just accepted it. I've accepted that I'm going to live the rest of my life just scraping by, having nothing of merit to share to my family when we talk. It really is the worst living this way, and I would give everything I have to be able to function like a normal person. Does anyone else have a similar experience?",bipolar_disorder
"Hey. I was diagnosed bipolar type 2 years ago. Was on antidepressants for a long time before bipolar diagnosis. Apparently certain anti-depressants can trigger manic symptoms. 

Before the dx docs throwing antidepressants at me and skyrocketing dosages all.over the place and I landed in the hospital with a new diagnosis, medication regime and rapid social status change from ""married"" to ""divorced"" and employment status from ""employed"" to ""unemployed"". 


Fastforward and I've been stable and employed with the same employer for quite a few years now.

The oamdemic hit and its hard to get in and get seen. Especially without insurance . I was seeing one Doc and I always fought about dosages. I didn't like feeling flat on prescribed dosages She said it was probably too low a dosage to be theraputic and effective. Been off meds for a long time now. A year? Longer mayber? Not sure. Been fine though. Stable and rational. 

Just hit theLittle winter depression speed bump, which right on time. Winter depression has been a regular friend that visits every year since I can remember. 


But lately though...ha ha. Well. Winter is over. I'm suddenly more energetic. Hard to sleep. Not getting a full night's rest yet waking up and going through the day with a surprisngly amount of energy. Everybody around me is getting a little.weird it feels like. 

Feels like time has slowed down when talking to people. Like ""hurry up and finish!"" when I'm talking to them. I feel smarter. Not smarter than other people, just smarter than my normal self.  Also way more sociable than normal. But on an edge happy sociable? That part might be the PTSD?  I always feel on high alert when in public anyways. 

Sudden new motivitation for career.change. Requires.me going back to school. I'm cool with that. I need to finish my degree anyways. Got a friend  teaching at program I want to attend.as well as works my prospective future employer. She encoursging. 

This wont be a quick thing. Months long process. 

Also, suddenly I developed a out of the blue, never had this interest before or mad.them.before,  but making youtube shorts. Like.borderline obsessed with it. 

That idea has morphed into doing a series of youtube ads for my current employer. I'm just scheming how to make this ideal profitable for me. I'm not handing suddenly new learned skills on top of my normal hour duties. Nope. Fuck that. But I'm still brainstorming video ideas. 

I did make some big purchases recently. but those were planned for months in advance. I talked about it often with friends and family,  I saved the money and budgeted for it. I'm very happy with the purchases. 

Sudden new interest in astronomy. Writing fiction. I got ideas suddenly zooming out left and right. Oh, and sudden desire to take back up martial arts.

I finally have a good doctor, but I saw lots of doctors initially who believed that I was simply depressed. I've read that there is a relationship between bipolar and immune dysfunction, though, so the two seem to be interrelated in ways that are too complex for me to understand.

I also wore my body down by not sleeping or eating, over-exercising, and binge drinking during my last manic episode. I feel immense regret for not taking the recommended dose of medication, because curbing the mania would probably have mitigated this disaster. I don't know how to keep living like this.

"hello, so iâ€™m new to this board. i was diagnosed with B1 at a younger age, around my 9th hospital visit. i guess im at a loss at this point. i watch the world around me and i just feel so off.

when i was thirteen i had about 7 of the 12 total hospital stays happen. in 6 months. my psychiatrist told me it was the most he had ever seen in a person get hospitalized in a few months. it was out and back for doing something else. fast forward, i was put in long-term residential for a few months. the police were regular occupants in my house because i was a flight risk. 

i guess i just canâ€™t handle any of this well yet. do you ever learn how to handle it? and, even more, does it ever work to your advantage? my psychologist told me that it can do a lot of bad, but that a lot of people who are bipolar are usually really creative. 

along with this iâ€™ve had a slew of diagnoses with, including PTSD OCD and ODD when i was 11. i seriously just need someone to hear me right now. i donâ€™t talk about myself a whole lot, so i guess this is me letting it out. 

either way, a more current problem, i went off on my boyfriend bad bad the other night. i threatened his family, him, and called all of them god knows what. itâ€™s like, he still sticks around. no matter what i say. my parents are perplexed and even ask him why he hasnâ€™t left yet, and i donâ€™t know why. like, i stopped eating significantly over 5 months and lost 50lbs just because I WANTED to. THEN I STOPPED. like wtf. i canâ€™t keep going like this. i donâ€™t even know if that can be a symptom, but honestly anything is possible at this point. 

everyone congratulates me about how good iâ€™ve been doing and how proud they are, but i just know how it always ends. it gets bad again, and idk, i guess itâ€™s just a feelingâ€¦ but i feel it coming.

"So this is going to be a bit of a long post. I have never been diagnosed with bipolar disorder nor have I been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, or any other types of psychological problems. The few times I have seen a psychologist, the meetings ended up feeling like a waste of time. However, I have had a lot of problems with depression in the past as well as certain behaviors that could be perceived as induced by a sort of manic state. However, never to the degree that I am experiencing right now. 

So, recently beginning about three days ago I began experiencing thoughts &amp; emotions that I haven't really experienced before. It felt like, not so much now, that I was on the verge of a major psychological breakthrough. It felt like I was experiencing a fundamental shift in how I perceive the world as well as myself. My moods were often shifting from feelings of deep profundity and hopefulness to vivid fantasies of driving out into the Texas desert and blowing my brains out (I don't own a gun and don't actually want to kill myself). These mood shifts would often happen within the span of a few minutes and most of my suicidal ideation would be washed away by feelings of euphoria. 

3 days ago, around the time of my strange moods, I began experiencing sleep troubles. I laid awake until about 5 am and eventually fell asleep after ingesting diphenhydramine (active ingredient in Nyquil). The second night, the same pattern occurred -- up until 5 am and then ingesting more diphenhydramine to fall asleep.

Last night it got even worse. I didn't sleep a single hour. I laid awake in bed until 5 am and didn't get a single minute of sleep. I instead went to the gym and lifted weights for a few hours. Tonight, it is around 9:30 PM and again I have zero desire to sleep and am instead stuck in a sort of agitated, wired state -- it feels like I've just had a cup of coffee. Mind you, I have had a total of 10 hours of sleep within the past 72 hours. 

I begin a new job tomorrow and if I stay up another night I will become a true psychotic by the morning. I have again ingested more diphenhydramine, hoping it obliterates all my energy. 

I'm a bit scared right now. I don't know how to process all of this. Does this sound like a manic episode?",bipolar_disorder

"My wife (38F) and I (43M) have been married a little over a year now. I think I've been in denial but I've definitely thought she could be bipolar for a long time.

It's not exactly regular but every month or so she will stop sleeping for a few days and her personality changes to withdrawn and she has no interest in anything but her phone and sitting outside smoking. At some point, she'll switch and she'll sleep for days and will only get up to eat.  About 2 to 3 weeks of every month she seems stable. She is supposed to take Adderall in the morning but I'm not so sure how good she is at taking her medication. I do know that the Adderall and the Seroquel are considered high doses. Could she have told her parents to not let on that she's bipolar because of the stigma? I'm no professional but this sounds more like type 2 bipolar than ADHD.

"Have any of you ever heard of the myth of Sisyphus? Itâ€™s an Ancient Greek story about a dude who was condemned to this island and had to roll a boulder up it for eternity, and every time he reached the top, the boulder would roll back down on him, and he would do it all over. 

It sounds kind of depressing, but for some reason this story gives me a lot of hope. 

No matter how many times this boulder of an illness makes me start back at the bottom, Iâ€™m gonna dust myself off and start climbing again, knowing full well my inevitably of being crushed. 

Nothing in life is permanent. My car will break down. My parents will die. Iâ€™ll lose friends. Iâ€™ll lose jobs. 

The one thing I will always have, is my inner challenge. To grow, to change, to try, to fail. Nothing in the world can take away my struggles and triumphs from me. For as long as I can hold on to the fire to keep going, even on the darkest snowy icy day, where this goddamn boulder wonâ€™t move 2 feet before rolling back down on me, I have something, something inside that canâ€™t be taken away. A driving force to keep going. Sometimes that force is pretty weak, a faint flicker, but itâ€™s the only thing that is truly mine in this world. 

Iâ€™m not gonna give up and I hope you never do either. I hope you can find peace in your journey. I hope your muscles grow a little each day, and that boulder gets a little lighter. I hope you take a moment to soak in the view when you reach the top. And try not to worry so much about rolling down, youâ€™re strong and youâ€™re gonna get right back on track, even if you have to lay on the ground in a daze for a minute.

"I've had two therapists recently, that don't believe I have Bipolar, even though my psychatrist does. This is so confusing, I'm so unsure of who to believe. I've always had trouble accepting this diagnosis myself, and this isn't helping. 

I've gone 9+ years off meds between my only two psychotic/manic episodes. After my first hospitalization I was diagnosed with bipolar, and took meds for about a year. I decided to stop them, and nothing bad happened. I had no episodes for over 9 years after stopping. Recently I was under some extra stress and had another psychotic episode that landed me in the hospital. I started taking meds again, got better, then went down into a long depression. I'm just now feeling much better after 5 months. 

I found a therapist, who didn't think I had bipolar since I did so well unmedicated for so long. Wanting to get a doctor's opinion, I found a new psychatrist, and she confirmed my bipolar diagnosis, tweaked my meds and got me feeling better. I started to believe my diagnosis was right, and figured I should keep taking meds to stay well. 

Recently I switched therapists and this new one also thinks the diagnosis is wrong! What's going on here, anyone else have this happen? Are psychatrists just slapping a label on symptoms like this so they can prescribe something that helps?

"Hey y'all. I finally got in to see my psychiatrist after waiting four months. After a long talk about my mood swings--I generally have about four bad depressive episodes each year that culminate in me hurting myself--we decided that the most effective drug to start with the least dangerous side effect profile would be Depakote. If you look on previous posts on here, I can't take Lamictal because I have a mutation associated with increased SJS risk.

I'm concerned to gain weight. I was underweight for the first 25 years of my life due to undiagnosed health problems. I'm now 30 and have been at a very healthy weight for a few years. I do cardio 2x per week and try to walk about 4,000-6,000 steps a day. I am vegetarian as well as gluten and dairy free. So I'm very concerned about fitness.

I did gain about 10lbs on mirtazapine due to increased appetite, but I was previously underweight anyway so it was a good thing.

Did anyone gain weight on Depakote while also maintaining a fitness-oriented lifestyle? I'm wondering if my lifestyle can offset the possible side effect or if it's strictly a metabolic thing.",bipolar_disorder

"Hi, i am 20 years old in culinary training to become a chef and have no idea why im writing a post like this

To start off im on no meds and have therapy, only newly diagnosed.

Im also going to tell this little story my therapist so dont worry but all i need is some answers of real people not someone paid for their opinion.

I only decided to pursue my hobby as a careeer last year, being a chef was never in my options because for the first 5-10 years the average pay is among the 5 least paid in my country, and its barely liveable with.

I changed because i really damn wanna be a cook i love it and i ""like"" my training(a training here means you basically do the same as a proper chef, just with occasional help and no right to say anything)as much as anyone likes their job, i dislike the overhours or the hard work but i still like it overall.

Usually my hypomania is pretty nice and my depressio expresses itself by me being, well, depressed and more but the main part is:i get emotional quick and stir shit up

I start way too many arguments in depressive, i randomly get mini breakdowns and just bring random shit up and start ruin relationships, however this morming before my shift it was different.

I didnt know what was happening, started as soon as ai woke up, i was so stressed about going to work, (as usual for chefs:) have no time for friends or family, and the hard fact that even after im done with the training, i wont even nearly have enough money to comfortably live 

So i wole up extremely stressed about all that, then basically cried in the restaurant i was getting lunch in, yelled a bunch at my partner and was so annoyed at everyone i just couldnt recognize myself. I calmed down on the shift but had extreme headache and nausea the whole day

Any idea what that was? Should i quit the training? 


I really REALLY wanna quit because the pay no matter how or where, will be extremely abyssmal, no time for friends and family, and ofc mentsl health plummeting

I dont wanna quit because the job is fun, i feel like its what i was supposed to do(i dislike small scale home cooking but LOVE cooking for others), and i like having a job and payment

"I have type 2 and, six years ago, it was the mania that tipped me off that I was dealing with more than depression. I hated it. I hate feeling like I have no verbal filter, like I'm trapped watching myself do or say things that I normally would never do or say. Medication has helped keep that in check, thankfully, because I hate dealing with it. I've never gotten why or how people thrive during the manic part because to me it always just felt like I was out of control and unable to focus.

Until now. I don't know what's changed, whether my medication levels are too low or what, but the mania has hit harder than in a long time. But not the bad parts. The last few days I've had so much energy and so much drive to just *do* things. Almost obsessive. I've just sat down after hours of cleaning (for the record I hate cleaning). There's still an element of not being fully in control but I've been so productive, and I can see why this feeling could be addicting and why it might seem attractive to stop taking meds in order to get this feeling more often. I've never, ever had the urge to go off my meds before, because of the mania. And now it's looking pretty attractive...because of the mania. I dunno. All this is hard.",bipolar_disorder

Iâ€™ve realized that doctors and therapists donâ€™t care about me. Why would they? They are just doing their job. Self love is all a lie. Itâ€™s not possible. I am a hermit. The only time I enjoy is when I am sleeping and dreaming. And even then I have been having nightmares lately.

Every day is the same. Day in day out. I am no role model. My family has noticed the change in me and it just makes them sad. Iâ€™m sad. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve made so many mistakes in my life. Medication is a scam. Meditation is a scam. Everything is a scam. I try to do art but all I do is point out the mistakes.

Fantasizing about shooting myself is my only respite. It makes me feel good to know I have an escape button. I have looked at my huge bottle of Depakote and wondered if it would do the trick.

My 20s just started and I feel middle aged. My therapist says I think like a 50 year old. Maybe my time is up. I canâ€™t see into the future anymore and maybe thatâ€™s because I donâ€™t have one. I just wish this was all over.",bipolar_disorder

"Hi everyone, I hope you are all doing well.

So, I've been taking Zoloft for a while, and I brought up some weird side effects I've been experiencing to my doctor. They said I've probably been experiencing mania (they noticed I was talking really fast during my session) and I most likely have bipolar 2 because I don't get any of the impulsive traits that come with bipolar 1.

"Hello everyone! I'm currently waiting on a diagnosis from a psychiatrist, but my family doctor is pretty confident that I'm experiencing some sort of bipolar disorder. I saw her today, expressed my concerns, and she says she's 99% sure that is probably what I have, having worked with lots of individuals with bipolar. 

Hopefully my referral to be diagnosed goes through soon, I'd like to have a solid diagnosis and plan of attack. 

I get extreme ups and downs in mood, usually every few weeks I'll switch. 

I was trying to explain what I now know to be a manic episode to my doc and medication consultant, and they called it ""hypo-mania"". 

They didn't want to speculate any more until I saw the psychiatrist, but I'm already in the process of switching from Sertraline to Wellbutrin. 

I'm kinda scared, and new to this whole mood disorder thing. I went years thinking my only disorder was social anxiety disorder, but my doc thinks that bipolar is much more likely. 

What exactly is ""hypo mania""? I've googled a bit, but what I've found basically just explains it as a toned down version of *actual* mania. 

Sorry if this post isn't allowed, or is too vague. I'm just a bit worried about myself, I'm hoping this new medication helps. I recently lost my job as I've been in a depression for a couple weeks now, and couldn't even force myself to go into work... 

Is this easily manageable? I'd like to get to the point where I can hold down a job. I'm really worried about switching medications too, I've been on Sertraline for 8 years and now I'm switching ðŸ˜¬ 

Is there anything you wish someone had told you while you were in the process of being diagnosed? Any advice, whatever it may be would be appreciated â¤ï¸",bipolar_disorder

I read online about the topic and it seems that there is only one study involving 8 people that resulting in two of them becoming manic taking the supplement.

"I'm currently somewhat recovered from a debilitating mixed episode sept-dec, including SI, SH and a bunch of fun hypomanic stuff. I finally got my psychiatrist evaluation today and was told BP2 affective disorder. 

I was told because I'm currently not in a major episode, that there is no medication for the middle ground between the two ends. They suggested that to level out the ""emotional dysregulation"" I still have (ongoing exhausting mood swings), I should pursue DBT or just check in with them periodically. Then if things get severe again, I call and can be given an appointment within two weeks. 

I am disappointed, to be honest. I haven't been stable since mid-2020 and I am *just. so. tired*. I resisted medication for years, trying to make my own way. I've tried meditation. I've tried breathwork and cold exposure therapy. I've tried holidays. I've tried friends. Changing my routine. My job. Ive tried psychedelics, which was a massive risk that did more harm than good in the end - triggered a manic episode. I've tried psychotherapy, repeatedly. I've tried exercise. I've tried keeping busy. I've tried not being too busy. Now they say, after vicious depression, that I'm not depressed enough to medicate because, I guess, I'm not suicidal right now, and can adequately parent and work. I don't want to be on meds forever. I just wanted a bit of space from all the noise in my head.

Does their approach sound right? I'm not one for thinking there is a magic pill solution - I know there isn't. I'm just *bone tired* of fighting to keep the mask on every day. I just wanted to take some distance for a while to gather myself and get back to the good fight, you know? And another 3 months on a waiting list to get a DBT therapist I have to pay for out of pocket....I don't know.

Anyway, appreciate all honest opinions if I'm just not being open enough to DBT or working on my emotional dysregulation or whatever. Thanks.",bipolar_disorder
"I am a 23 yo male. I have my own place, but recently have been spending more time with my parents at their house. My Dad and Mom have been married 28 years. My dad is bipolar. He is very successful at his job, they have a beautiful house. My mom is so patient with him, caters to him and does so much for him. He is incredibly polite to most every person, including me. But he is absolutely awful to my mom. He does not ever hit her, but any little thing that sets him off is my mom's fault. He will yell at her, throw things, not speak to her. 

As a kid, I never realized that this was abnormal. I grew up to be afraid of my dad. Now that I am older, I really want to stand up to him and tell him what an absolute asshole he is to my mom. If I was her, I would have divorced him long ago.  It's like he bottles all of it up and is nice to everyone throughout the day, and then unloads on my mom. It is heart breaking and I feel like less of a man for not standing up for her. If a stranger talked to her like that I wouldnt think twice to give them the what for. Don't get me wrong. I love my dad. But he needs another man to tell him to get his shit in line with my mom.

"CW: general mention of suicide and self harm.




Hello everyone,

I just need to vent to people who might understand what I'm feeling or personally experienced what I've been struggling with. 

I was diagnosed with BP 1 in mid-2015, had my very first episode literally in the first month of 2015. Prior to that I felt like my life was coming together and all the pieces were fitting. I had direction and finally had a name for some of the things I had been struggling with since childhood (I came out as transgender in 2013). 

A little extra background, I suffered from chronic (nightly) disturbing hypnopompic and hypnagogic hallucinations (auditory and visual), sleep walking, sleep paralysis, reoccurring nightmares, and occasionally sleep terror? (I'd wake up full of fear, with only one thought ""I need to get out"" and I'd run out of my bedroom in fear. The fear would disappear once I got a few feet from my room, and I'd be fully awake). They started at around kindergarten or 1st grade (only reoccurring nightmares and hallucinations), but I was a difficult sleeper as a baby too. In 3rd grade (2003) they advanced to the list mentioned above and stayed that way until fall 2019 (the only change was dating my current partner, not my first partner though).


So I saw my first Shrink from mid-2015 until winter 2019, then he retired. Since then finding a replacement has been a struggle! I've seen three so far and each one just don't listen. One only prescribed me antidepressants (for some reason) and was ""surprised"" that I struggled with manic episodes (even though he had my prior records, I guess he didn't read them?). He also told me that ""everyone struggles with that"" when I told him that recently I'd start crying during inappropriate times (I started ugly crying while watching an educational video on Tokyo's train/subway system, for example.) I didn't cry during sad or emotional moments, just randomly it'd feel like a bomb made of sadness would explode in my chest while watching non-emotional videos. 

The second one admitted that they weren't sure what to prescribe me (based off of my medication history), sent me to IOP.  IOP prescribed Depakote frist (wanting to add a antidepressant if I react well), but depakote caused me to become so angry (24/7) that I started struggling with self harm (I have no history of cutting prior to taking depakote). When I reached out to them saying that depakote wasn't working and was causing emotional distress and I wanted to wean off of it they kept responding with ""wait until your next appointment"" but I hadn't been contacted to schedule one yet so I had no idea what appointment they were referring to. 

I dropped out of that because I realized they didn't actually care, I even told them I'd sign a ROI if it means talking to a available shrink about weaning off. They just kept saying the same thing. Worried I'd hurt myself even worse I contacted my GP for advice and he helped me wean off (it was extended release, 700mg). I lost all trust in that program. 

Fast forward, I told my shrink (at the time) about what happened, she suggested I ask them if they'd let me back in, but I explained that I didn't trust them anymore (what if the same thing happens with another med?). Later this shrink would tell me she wants to stop prescribing (at this point I haven't been on any meds because none we try have worked. 

With her I tried: Wellbutrin (reg., extended, and sustained release), Lamictal, and Seroquel. That's it. That's all she tried with me. Each one caused ""deal breaker"" side effects (suicidal, muscle issues, and worsened my incontinence). 

She believed that my anxiety (which I've had since childhood, I'm very familiar with it and I have been able to manage it without meds) was causing the ""deal breaker"" side effects. 

So I started hunting for another shrink. 

Thought I found a good one. He (like all my other shrinks) talked about being conservative with prescribing meds. I was excited because I don't want to be over medicated ever again, I just want to be on enough to function on a daily basis (like to be able to shower and brush my teeth everyday, self-care stuff, and not be suicidal or at least be able to manage my suicidal/mood struggle). 

But today (after our second appointment) he assumed (didn't even ask) that I wasn't suicidal (I struggle with suicidal ideation everyday, often multiple times a day) and told me I just needed to try hard enough and that I don't need meds but rather awareness and a supplement (L-methl folate) to help me stabilize. 

I'm so sad. I feel so defeated. I just want to stabilize enough to go back to school, get a job, take care of myself, etc. 
I get that meds aren't ""magic pills"" but rather supplemental in the overall treatment (which includes other therapies). 

So now I'm on the search again. And with the shortage it isn't easy. The only positive is that I don't have to worry about refilling an existing prescription... But the mood swings destroy me. I'm on a rollercoaster and I'm not having a good time, I feel like I have emotional whiplash from my rapid cycling. And since I've attempted suicide in the past (all failed) I feel no one really cares or listens when I say I think of killing myself daily. Thankfully I have the support of my partner and parents. I'd be homeless or dead without them. 

Thank you for reading my vent (if you read it). I needed this. 


Take care everyone.",bipolar_disorder
"Hello there! Iâ€™m on lamictal and my friend is as well.

"In January I was put back on a mood stabilizer (just lamotrigine 100mg), and my moods have felt a lot more stable which is nice. I donâ€™t feel great but Iâ€™m not depressed either. Just kind of blah. (I felt really good at first but have come down a bit lately). However Iâ€™ve been having violent, graphic suicidal thoughts and urges that just wonâ€™t go away. This is not something new since Iâ€™ve been on the new medication, so that hasnâ€™t caused it or anything. Itâ€™s just troubling me more right now because Iâ€™m not depressed and it feels wrong to still be having these thoughts, especially for them to be so strong and persistent. 

Theyâ€™re like intrusive thoughts, thoughts that feel like they are coming from someone else and not me. I donâ€™t want to explain them right now because itâ€™s too triggering for me but if you want context Iâ€™ve posted in regards to this before. This started in the fall of 2020 and continued on until I started hearing actual voices telling me the same things as these thoughts and tried to act on what they were telling me multiple times until I was hospitalized. The voices went away with new medications, but then these horrible thoughts came back pretty quickly and wonâ€™t go away. 

I finally told my psychiatrist about it and how Iâ€™m worried that Iâ€™m going to act on them. She said itâ€™s either a psychotic thought or an obsessive thought, and that for now I just need to ignore it. But the thing is, I canâ€™t ignore it. It wonâ€™t get out of my head and is in the back of my mind ALL the time. I do not want to die but I feel like I have to. I feel so STUPID because I know itâ€™s irrational but the urges are SO strong and the thoughts so relentless that itâ€™s getting harder and harder to feel like I even SHOULD resist it. I keep thinking of ways to â€œsatisfyâ€ the thoughts and urges without actually hurting myself but nothing helps. 

I honestly just donâ€™t know what to do. Does anyone else experience this? How do you cope? How do you keep yourself safe?",bipolar_disorder

"As a follow up to my previous post I feel fine now. I donâ€™t feel crazy anymore, but now I can clearly reflect on how I felt during that short time where I really felt crazy. 

I talked to my friend who is diagnosed bipolar, and she said she doesnâ€™t think I have it (which made me feel relieved) because she said when sheâ€™s manic she feels just overwhelming euphoria, and I was describing fear, anxiety, paranoia, disconnect from reality, and derealization/depersonalization. Mostly negative emotions with some spikes of â€œhappyâ€ dashed in every once in a while. 

Iâ€™m not really sure what to do now, because all of the therapists in my area are fully booked so now Iâ€™m one some waiting lists because I really felt like I went crazy. !TW! Something I did while feeling all these emotions and disconnect which Iâ€™ve never even had enough anger to do before was I got in a smallish fight with my mom and blew up, and then since I couldnâ€™t find a knife anywhere in my room I just pierced my own ear with a needle since there was a needle laying around. Now I have a really crooked 3rd ear piercing LMAO (since I didnâ€™t really look at what I was doing)

Also during those 4-5 days where I felt mostly horrible, (but very energetic) I had moments where it would just simmer down. If I listened to sad music I would cry and feel depressed almost immediately, and begin to feel like I was just moving through life with no real purpose again. But that didnâ€™t last long and as soon as I actually did something I kind of went hyper again and even more foggy and depersonalized. I had this really overwhelming fear that people would find out I was completely disconnected, and I kept thinking people knew. I remember laughing at things and then thinking, in almost a third person perspective â€œwhy am I laughingâ€ or â€œwhy did I say thatâ€ but I could never stop myself. Sometimes I would feel so happy and good but it could very quickly go away and be replaced with anxiety. 

If what I experienced wasnâ€™t mania or depression, does anyone here know where I could find some good information on what happened? I really felt like a different person completely separated from everything with no control of myself or things I said. I remember spam texting people a billion messages about stupid stuff and I yelled at my science teacher because she was explaining things so slow. I would never in a million years make it obvious I was frustrated with a teacher because Iâ€™m so scared of getting in trouble, so I donâ€™t know where that came from.

My best friend has been diagnosed bipolar for a few years now and through this process she will begin taking meds and do well, then abruptly stop taking them and dive bomb. I donâ€™t see her super often because she is not a very good communicator, but told me tonight that about a month ago she topped taking one of her meds again, I think it was called lithium? 
She also told me tonight that she believes she has been communicating with a spirit via writing and drawing. She has always been spiritual but I feel like this has taken on a new level. She mentioned a lot about a parallel universe (said she had never thought about this until she watched stranger things) and how she believes that the earth is entering a new dimension. One question that she asked this spirit is if meditation will change the world, which it answered yes. I watched her do this communication tonight and to me it looked like her zoning out while scribbling a bunch of circles. 

I want to believe all this, but It seems to me that the questions and answers she asks are things that she already believes. She also has been reading about the history of witches and watching stranger things (hence the parallel universe), and some other movie.

"*thank you for taking the time to read all of this :/ it's a bit long

Hello! I have been working with my therapist for over four months now. Will check out a neurologist towards the end of the month (hopefully will have my brain scanned and stuff checked out (I am curious and this was my idea)). Also will check out a psychiatrist soon (waiting on details for a place they (my therapist) has recommended) and am kind of excited for when my therapist and the psychiatrist will work together. I am kind of optimistic but that is not to say that the past year has not been both rough and better. Better in that I have more ""focused"" or ""solid"" moments but still rough because I am *mostly alone in this and other reasons - all of this is not easy. Trying to work on myself and whatnot.

My situation is a long *thing spanning since post 2016. 2018 was probably when I think I really disconnected and was always in the ""dark"" - when I look back that is what it feels like and I worry. By then I mostly stayed in my residence all the time but every now and then I would force myself to walk from one destination to another (2.5 hours to - 2.5 back) usually 1:30 PM - 8:00PM or 9:30 PM to 1:45AM. I would have to write a lot more to explain how I tried to ""fight"" my mental illness but no. I tried and I am still trying.

It was around 2020 June was what did me in differently. The isolation was not what made things worse on me because I was kind of used to being isolated - in my teenaged years I used to be a ""creative"" person and drew concepts of characters while listening to loud underground music (indie folk rock or alternative  - that sort). *I did take the pandemic seriously - masks make it hard for me to breathe with my anxiety but screw it I always had mine on out of courtesy and mostly stayed away from people (which was easy for me because I grew up learning which streets were emptier and nicer to walk in by myself). 

*Lady Red Couture passed away on July 2020 due to health complications (Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome) and I didnt want to spread Covid-19 if this virus had anything to do with Lady Red Couture because it really sucked that such a powerful person would pass on like that at such a time.


I live in a major city. I am a native of that city and know a good portion of it. I have certain routes and areas I really like because of how isolated they can be (ahaha - mostly industrial areas in the winter or very quiet summer afternoons in some out of the way residential areas). In any case my mental illness really got to me when the fireworks started. Then the dirt bikes - sports cars and the such. This year after FEB. things started to quiet down very slowly. The last two to three weeks seemed to have been especially quiet except for a few days. But since 2020 my mental health was pretty freaking blurry and exhausting. The increase in aggressive noise and traffic was not unique to my city - I heard and read that in other countries these things also happened. 

But I wanted to ask because sometimes I ask myself what is going on exactly? Is it really just me? Am I so darn bitter that maybe it really is all in my head and I am imagining  the aggression *I live in a high traffic area and it is not as bad as it was before I moved last year when/where the motorists were very loud. But I sometimes I ask myself some uncomfortable questions and I wonder if it is just me - which is an issue because for the last year I was growing so detached and didnt notice or couldnt stop myself from ""fading"" out and snapping out of it was impossible because the traffic noise outside was unbearable in a way. And it was/is constant with no warning.

Am I the only one with questions? I swear at this point my roommate might have something to do with it - my roomate is originally from another state and grew up there. I have talked to my PCP about it when I had some physicals and fluids checked out in the last few weeks and my told my therapist first thing out of safety. My PCP (i felt) genuinely at least heard me but my therapist is working from out of the city still and probably didnt experience the increase in noise. But he has said that he believes that I believe that this is my reality - in a way I dont think he is listening.

Please feel free to send me a message or whatnot. 
*Please feel free to ask me anything - besides the pandemic and political / social unrest the last few years I feel like there is something else going on that I missed. 

I wanted to know if the increase of aggressive traffic noise was also affecting others because in a bad day it sucks - I tend to just shut down and isolate.

"47/m. History of depression (which mostly expressed as excessive daytime sleepiness). Both parents struggled with mental health but were never formally diagnosed. 

Iâ€™ve seen several counselors and even a shrink over the years and was only diagnosed GAD + depression but no one ever mentioned bipolar as a possibility. After two sessions with new therapist, she was floored no one has ever diagnosed me bp. 

I have very little knowledge of bp disorders so my first response is to tell her sheâ€™s wrong because I donâ€™t have any â€˜highsâ€™ or manic episodes (at least as far as I can tell). If I have been â€˜manic,â€™ Iâ€™ve been that was my entire life and the first real (noticeable to me) â€˜downâ€™ started toward the beginning of this year and has gotten markedly worse recently. 

Two weeks ago, I couldnâ€™t get out of bed (again, first time in my life). I sit in the bottom of the shower for an hour just existing. 

My symptoms: canâ€™t focus, poor appetite, trouble sleeping (had several sleep studies and theyâ€™ve proven normal) heavy brain fog thatâ€™s almost disorienting at times, spaced out, leaden paralysis (not constantâ€”comes and goes), no libido, no pleasure doing anything. 

At its worst, it feels almost impossible to move or even talk. At its best (after my last ketamine infusion, for example), I feel almost normal with just some trouble with sleep maintenance insomnia. 

In an abstract sense, it just seems like there is wonderful music being played that I just canâ€™t hear. 

Brief context: I worked as a teacher until about 12 years ago when I started my own business. I had a terrible experience working in a rough schoolâ€”that was the first time Iâ€™d ever experienced anxiety in my life. Six weeks of Celexa and the anxiety resolved and other than being sleepy, felt â€˜fineâ€™ until earlier this year. 

I also have four kids I homeschool and have published several books in different fields (I say that not to brag bc the books suckâ€”just to underscore how productive Iâ€™ve been all of my life). In terms of meds, I started 10 mg of Celexa about two weeks ago. I also finished my 6th Ketamine infusion about a week ago and have a 7th scheduled for Wednesday.

This is probably going to be long, my apologies. 

To preface this, my mother was diagnosed with depression when she was young, and her brother, later, Manic Deppressive (which, as far as I'm aware, is the outdated name for Bipolar.) As a child, I was prone to self harm when I would upset or disappoint someone. It was like I was sort of dishing out my own punishment because I felt like I had to. I was never particularly impulsive, but little things would make me super emotional. Simple trivial stuff like a dropping food on the floor would make me bawl my eyes out much past the age where that was considered normal. Even into my early teens I struggled with crying over things I didn't even think were worth crying over. Now, in the present, I have this same issue, but it's been replaced with anger instead. My emotions can basically thrust me into a state of mind where returning to happy or even just a neutral emotion feels borderline impossible. I'm finding the easiest way to expel the feelings are through sleeping and sensory deprivation, otherwise I'll be still be emotionally charged for even hours later. Little tiny things that people say or do, particularly certain tones, can launch me into a fit of intense anger. On the flipside, when I become happy, I will not be able to shut up. It's just constant elation and I feel like I'm king of the world, which, can be quickly swapped out for self hatred and negativity with the smallest push.

I do not want to gain weight on another antipsychotic, and am likely to not be medication compliant because of this. Iâ€™m extremely depressed, and weight gain adds to the depression. I refuse to leave my apartment. I also read that Paliperidone increases depressive symptoms, like taking away your motivation. What other side effects does it cause ? 

She also prescribed Seroquel for sleep issues. Iâ€™ve had racing thoughts before sleeping lately, but my biggest problem is not being able to wake up until woken up by someone else in the afternoon. Will Seroquel help with my oversleeping ? I also read that it causes weight gain. My psychiatrist says itâ€™s hard to say if it does. If this is true, I wonâ€™t get it picked up from the pharmacy. I never used to have weight issues, I feel terrible, and Iâ€™m not motivated to do anything.

I had a 6 month long psychotic episode, with remnants of it appearing for another 6 months. When I was hospitalized, I was given 2mg of Risperdal, and a monthly shot of Invega. Neither of them helped in taking away my psychosis, and I countinued to experience symptoms until a month after hospitalization.

The Risperdal made me gain weight, so I asked to be taken off of it. While on the Invega, I experienced psychosis once a day, monthly. This could be correlated to marijuana use.

"Bipolar 1, with psychotic features and GAD. I think I have sleep apnea (was diagnosed last summer but because of life changes couldn't follow up) and am considering getting a CPAP.

But I've also read about [CPAP induced mania](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4208920/) so am a little scared to try.

"So I have been on meds since I was 13. Well back in October after my IUD insertion (I know really weird) my anxiety spiked and I went into a constant DPDR (Depersonalization/Derealization disorder). In January my anxiety was making me so sick and I thought it was either my meds that I had been on for 4 months, I was dying, or my IUD. I started with my meds. I went off of the celexa I was on for a year and a half and stopped my trileptal that I was on for 4 months. Nothing changed. So I got my IUD removed and went back onto the pill. Nothing changed. So we have been on the search. I tried prozac... it was fkn awful.. I am talking wicked intrusive thoughts, constant panic attacks such as waking up and not knowing where I was to having to remind myself I am here. With DPDR it is similar to that but not to that extent daily. I was given the go to stop it after a month. I then tried abilify which had me wanting to crawl up the walls. I tried it twice and the second dose had me shaking uncontrollably, heart pounding, the room spinning, etc. I stopped it without even telling them, there was no way I was going to wait that one out. Since then I just haven't taken meds. This was almost 3 months ago. Now I feel my mood swings. The tight jaw, and just feeling gross. I asked for my trileptal back and got it back butt haven't taken it.. It's been 3 weeks. I never want to feel like I did on prozac and abilify again and tbh I feel almost traumatized from those experiences. Being in a constant DPDR and being almost agoraphobic is hell enough..

"Hi, Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and have been in therapy for a while. Iâ€™ve been suffering from depression for years, since childhood. I started taking Lexapro 10mg a couple of years ago and it was helping me go on autopilot so to speak during rough times. 

Now, Iâ€™ve been suffering from depressive episodes quite often with suicidal ideation which is really on the forefront. Iâ€™m ok for a couple of days or weeks, and the depressive episode comes back. I figured it was my BPD and I was triggered by something that I couldnâ€™t recognize as a trigger but now that Iâ€™m looking into bipolar 2, I see many similarities.

Between the depressive moments, I am pretty cheerful and know I should make the most out of it and start doing all my chores, make plans etc etc. Not really manic but just feeling a bit better and having a better outlook on life and wanting to better myself again. 

During depression, I donâ€™t want to be perceived by anyone, if that makes sense. I donâ€™t want to exist, Iâ€™m suicidal, thereâ€™s no hope and I just want to sleep the day away. I feel no joy doing anything. 

I am going to see a therapist within a week and will tell him about my findings. I would like to try a mood stabilizer instead of antidepressants. I have tried quetiapine before but that had a bad effect on me.

"Hi all, 

Bit of a niche question but thought Iâ€™d ask it all the same. 

In a nutshell, I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and my new psychiatrist believes that I either donâ€™t have bipolar at all, or the seriousness of my condition has been greatly over-exaggerated by my previous doctor. 

We are currently working at trimming back my circa 10 medications back to about 2-3, which Iâ€™m agreeable to. Tonight, I start on a reducing dose of Latuda (Lurasidone) from 75mg down to 37.5mg. I am still taking Seroquel 150 and lithium 1000mg.

"I'm BP2, and my doctor prescribed Lamictal. I see a lot of other posters here are on 2, 3, 4+ meds, and I'm wondering: Did you get multiple meds prescribed because you tried one by itself and it didn't work, or was it a ""This combo is recommended"" kind of approach?",bipolar_disorder

Iâ€™m just always in a bad mood. This isnâ€™t new-itâ€™s been this way my whole life. The doctors thought Abilify would help but I suffered from hypomania and compulsive shopping from it.

"Long story short, I was diagnosed about 6 years ago and had no real issues keeping everything together; then I met my husband and everything changed. 

I felt like a zombie but wanted to have more fun and be able to think more clearly.

My meds made pregnancy dangerous and I learned firsthand when I had a miscarriage two years ago.

I lost my support system and ever since my sister got pregnant, the world has revolved around her and her baby, meanwhile I was told I was reckless and irresponsible for allowing myself to become pregnant.

Anyway, I haven't had my meds in about two months now and I'm thinking about starting again because I feel absolutely zero desire to do anything at any time. My relationships are strained, my self image is ruined. I keep doing what I think I'm supposed to be doing but nothing gets any better.

I've spoken with my psychologist and psychiatrist about my symptoms, but not very much in-depth as this is a new venture. They do know I am on sertraline for anxiety and that my paternal grandfather was Bipolar 1, but have both said I'm more than likely Bipolar 2 and have prescribed medication.

Now what I'm about to say is why there is so many problems in the world right now...I'm listening and taking to heart what non-medical professionals have to say. My friends and some family have said ""they are diagnosing you after one call? Are they just reading off a checklist?"" That of course starts me spiraling like, you're right!

"Hi I'm new here (26/M), in a previous post I mentioned that up until a year ago, I had been on Adderall (50Mg) a day every day, for 15+ years. Last year I got dropped from my psychiatrist, and went through a year of withdrawal, (Long story short, it was hell, and I wanted to die. I got into an IOP, got on new meds, and I'm stable now after accepting my bipolar depression diagnosis.)

The thing is I'm really confused about mania. I've been told that being on that much Adderall with bipolar depression pretty much put me in a permanent manic state for years, and I just learned to deal with it, because the Adderall helped me focus the energy to tasks like chores, and school work.

This past year, even though I'm stable now, I'm kinda disappointed with my emotions I just don't feel as happy as I did on Adderall, and I'm wondering... What if I wasn't happy back then? What if I was just manic, and I've confused mania, with what happiness is supposed to feel like because it's all I've ever known? Does that make sense?

Because if I was manic instead of happy, then of course I'd be disappointed with what normal happiness feels like. From what I know manic episodes make you feel euphoric. What if I got so used to that euphoric feeling on Adderall, that I accepted it as average? (How I'm supposed to feel all the time.)

"I am going through the process of getting diagnosed with Bipolar right now. Long story short, my therapist isnâ€™t comfortable diagnosing bipolar in patients so my PCP had to refer me to a psychiatrist. I didnâ€™t think I was Bipolar until I told her my recent symptoms and put together the pattern. 

Iâ€™ve had a hyper sex drive as long as I can remember but, after going through a breakup, I decided to indulge in it (not always being the safest) and realized I couldnâ€™t control myself, which is what prompted my PCP to bring up Bipolar. 

Iâ€™m really excited to get diagnosed and on medication because the depressive episodes have ruined most of my adult life and gotten me into a lot of trouble with my jobs. So Iâ€™m thrilled to have a solution on the horizon that can hopefully get me on a consistent path in my career.

However, Iâ€™m worried about my sex drive. Iâ€™ve grown to love it and Iâ€™ve been really enjoying when Iâ€™m manic and indulging it. Iâ€™m worried that when I start medication, itâ€™ll go away completely. Has that been the case with anyone?

For some reason the sound of her voice just made me want to go on a murderous rampage. I know that sounds scary &amp; messed up &amp; like itâ€™s definitely something to worry about but I was able to hold it down enough to leave the room. I have 8 people in my house right now &amp; all the kids were already talking loudly.

Iâ€™ve told her she needs to get her hearing checked cause her volume is outta control. But when she walked in yelling at her kids it sent me into a rage. I started crying, shaking &amp; I had this automatic twitch which looked like I had Touretteâ€™s. I couldnâ€™t control the twitching at all. I dropped the frying pan &amp; grabbed my meds &amp; water bottle &amp; ran to my room crying. My husband came home just at that time &amp; followed me into the room.

She even told my psychologist on virtual video yesterday morning that she was willing to drive me to the airport so I can meet him. So how does she switch up the minute she sees Iâ€™m content?

When I was younger she punished me for not washing dishes by biting me. If I yelled at her she would hit me with a pan. If I folded clothes incorrectly, Id get smacked with a hanger.

"My dysphoria appeared when I was 9 and going through puberty. But it was not consistent. I would feel it on a random day on February, then it would disappear and appear again on a random day in November. The dysphoria was painful, but short-lived. After feeling it, I would go back to feeling neutral about my gender the next day.

However, I got diagnosed with bipolar 2 this year and got prescribed with mood stabilisers (300 mg of quetiapine). My bipolar is now managed, since Iâ€™ve been feeling neutral; but then my dysphoria began to attack me more frequently than before. For example, it would attack me once every few months, but now itâ€™s multiple days in a month. I talked about this with both my psychiatrist and therapist and they comfirmed that the bipolar mania made my dysphoria disappear for most of the time. Since my bipolar is stabilised it canâ€™t â€œprotectâ€ me anymore. So basically, bipolar âœ… dysphoria âŒ; bipolar âŒ dysphoria âœ….

Obviously, bipolar is a bad thing to have, but it hurts less than dysphoria. If bipolar was a spider-bite, dysphoria would be a vivisection.

Her diagnoses are major anxiety/depression.  Her father and I truly think she has BPD but we don't think she's being honest with her therapist and psychiatrist.  She stopped going to high school when she was 16 but managed to graduate doing online classes, and she only graduated because her dad basically held her hand and did alot of her work (another topic in itself).  She is completely isolated, doesn't work, doesn't go to school, has no friends.  She is at heart a lovely, kind person with a heart of gold, but when she goes into her episodes, all hell breaks loose.  She is verbally abusive to her dad and I, and will go on days long tirades about how terrible we are, we have ruined her life, and she wishes we were dead. She calls us every name in the book..I can't even repeat most of it here.  Her dad never pushes back on her behavior, and I only do when I've completely exhausted all of my internal resources to keep myself calm. When I call out her behavior it results in WW3, because at that point I've lost my cool, and then she threatens to harm herself.  Yesterday was one such incident and she spent the entire day (and I mean entire) blowing up my phone with texts. I would estimate she sent me about 200 texts yesterday.  

She did an IOP when she was 16, but since then has refused our suggestions for inpatient or another IOP.  She's also having physical health issues and will at times refuse to go to her appointments.  

Her dad and  I (we're divorced) would do anything for her, but we're at the end of our rope. We are both having health issues brought on by stress. The stress is unbelievable.

She's currently on Lamictal (100) and Cymbalta (80) but they're clearly not working.

"Hi guys,

I was wondering which kind of lifestyle rules do you follow to manage your episodes? Anything that definitely works for you?

I'm recovering from a severe depressive episode with a stay in psych ward this year. A few months ago I decided to stop daily drinking alcohol and smoking weed, going to the gym a few times a week, eat more healthy and I'm drinking more water. 6 weeks ago I also decided to quit smoking.

Didn't notice any changes until last week. For the first time this year I had a stable week, without severe mood swings and SI. I'm really happy and proud at myself. It motivates me to just keep going. 

Also curious what others do regarding lifestyle to prevent future episodes, maybe I can learn from that. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 3 years ago and never payed attention to my lifestyle. Just took my meds hoping it would work..",bipolar_disorder

"Title might be misleading. I'm in no way suicidal. I just sometimes wish I was a completely different person. Living with extreme bipolar is something not many would understand. 

I love life.. I love the human experience. I'm not trying to sound ungrateful, but it's days like these, where the bipolar shows bad, that I just wish I wasn't me. I seem to always affect the people around me, no matter how hard I try. 

I'm 21, M, and have a beautiful 2 months daughter and a beautiful fiancee. I suffer from sleep apnea, which comes along with insomnia, and daytime drowsiness at the same time. It's a nightmare. I usually sleep through the day because of it... I try to wake up.. I try really. I just fail. 

My fiancee really had it after 2 weeks of these symptoms really getting the best of me... Rightfully so. She snapped. Woke me up at 4 in the afternoon to yelling saying she's been attempted to wake me up several times in the past couple hours. Telling me how lazy I am, and all the above. I probably deserved it, but instead of acknowledging her need for help with our child, I instead broke out in a fit of yelling back. Screaming actually. She didn't deserve that, but I kept going. 

This went on for 15 minutes before I went to the bathroom, slammed the door, and put my head through the bathroom wall (literally). I gave myself a mild concussion, and then broke down in tears. 

She deserves so much better. My daughter deserves more, but I'm stuck like this. Meds don't help.. Therapy doesn't help.. I make progress, take 10 steps forward, and then get pushed back 100 steps. 

I try to be a better person. I really do. And then I fail. Why couldn't I have been born into a different life. This sucks so bad. For me, the people around me, I fuckin hate myself man.",bipolar_disorder

It makes me feel left out when they don't even invite me to come and it stings.

I guess the only upside is that being sober sort of 'confirms' that I really have bipolar because I still got hypomanic and now I feel depressed as fuck. At least it wasn't all in my head or due to drugs/drinking like everyone has been telling me. The self doubt is insane.

Recently heâ€™s been complaining to some other friends that Iâ€™ve â€œchangedâ€ from who I was around last summer, or before medication when I was manic. Specifically this was when I was drinking heavily and had severe delusions. And heâ€™s right, I have changed and from my perspective for the better. Iâ€™m stable and Iâ€™m happy. Iâ€™ve been sober for 9 months. My personality has changed quite a bit but for me it just feels like Iâ€™m myself again instead of manic if that makes sense.

"Hello y'all, I have bipolar 1 and frequently hallucinate and have delusions when I'm in mania. But I have a question for those of you who also do. Is it normal to have occasional hallucinations even when you're not in mania? I don't have any delusions, at least that I can tell...I'm not going around and telling people aliens are coming and shit like that again lol so good sign.

But yeah, is it normal for you to still have occasional hallucinations even when you aren't in mania or a bad depression? About once a day I'll have some type of hallucination, for example yesterday I heard a scratching noise from inside of the pillow at my girlfriends house. But I couldn't find anything that could have done it, no bugs or anything, and she didn't hear it when she listened. Today I heard somebody make a disgusted noise (like ""eugh"" mixed with ""ew"" or something) in my car when I was driving alone. Only explanation I can think of is it was a hallucination.

I'm just wondering if it is a common experience in others, and happens to you as well...... Ooooor if it's something I should worry about and go see my doctor? Again it isn't like constantly, I'm not hearing voices or anything and it's only about once a day.",bipolar_disorder
"Should I be worried?

I really like this job. Like, really like it. It's the first one I've ever worked that I can function in, that I do a good job in. That I'm passionate about, even. I do not want to lose it. I don't want the environment to change.

I just got off a really long, slow shift. I was working with someone who's been at the job for quite a while and they were being really, really open with me, telling me why they loved it and how they got it and how passionate they were about our line of work. Essentially giving me their life story. I guess I was feeling safe or  vulnerable, whatever, and so, before I could think about it, I just said that I have bipolar disorder and I was so happy and relieved to find a job that clicked with me.

They didn't pry or even look/sound judgemental. And our conversation just continued on. At the time, I didn't give it much thought. Then I got in my car to go home and... I just panicked a bit.

They (the coworker) aren't in charge of me or anything. I did not dislcose my disability upon hiring (maybe I should have?). I do not know this person enough to trust them (maybe that's why I'm being paranoid). I never, ever, ever tell people about my diagnosis unless they absolutely need to know, because I'm normally very private and guarded. I just don't feel like it's relevant to share. 

I know this might sound stupid. I might be overreacting. Maybe not. But do I have anything to be worried about? Or will everything be okay? I do my job well. I do not want  people to start treating me differently. It's so dumb, but I'm so afraid the coworker will tell others and it will change the way I'm treated at work.

I have bipolar disorder NOS (my psychiatrist doesn't quite know if it's cyclothymia or BD type 2; some episodes last for 2 days and some for 4 months, I'm just fucked up really); generalized anxiety disorder; substance use disorder and (possibly) Asperger.

I'm quite stable thanks to Abilify 5mg and Lamotrigine 250mg but all of those conditions are ruining my life in terms of anxiety.

I can't go out without taking Ativan or Etizolam. We tried everything for my anxiety, pregabalin; multiple antipsychotics; propranolol... I can't even remember everything we tried to help with that; my psychiatrist told me he didn't know what try next. Breathing deeply for 3 minutes kinda helps, but only for an hour or so.

Only benzos work. I'm afraid of benzodiazepine-induced Alzheimer and other memory impairments but I just can't function without them. I've been on Ativan for 4-5 years, on and off to avoid tolerance. Currently taking 2mg 3 times a day, and actively trying to reduce.

"For absolutely freaking nothing. 

CVS, in their infinite wisdom, decided that, since that particular store was *out* of Ambien, they would go into the computer system and change the date that it was allowed to be filled. To 32 days after the previous fill. Really. Then lie, again, and claim that they were really doing me a favor because I hadn't picked up that last refill until a week after the day it was filled, so, you know, they were being *generous* and letting me have it 3 days early.

Friends, I have never picked up Ambien a week late in my life. The secondary nausea meds, maybe, maybe the prescription toothpaste, but not *the one thing that allows me to sleep at night.* 

To top it off, they didn't get around to filling it until right before closing tonight, TWO EXTRA DAYS LATE, and I, who lives in the damn countryside, can't get there to get it. SO, tomorrow will be the first night in nearly a week that I have my sleep meds, and I am NOT doing well. I'm obviously going to have to start half-dosing for a few nights a week until I save up some spares (not against the prescription, it's 1/2 to 1 per night, only 1/2 doesn't really work), but it's frustrating that this whole debacle could have been fixed if they'd just been honest in any of their interactions in time for my doctor to call it in to a different pharmacy. By the time they admitted what they'd done, after I physically went to the store, my doctor was already unavailable. Holiday weekend, you know.

Sigh. You know what a fine line it is with sleeplessness. I am probably one traumatic event away from snapping and obliterating the entire world. (Jk.) If they don't have my gabapentin filled, too, I will probably be the ultimate freaking Karen, and I *never* pull that shit. I understand supply chain crap but not obscuring the truth until someone actually shows up in person to demand answers. Definitely calling these in to a different CVS next time... I can't switch pharmacies entirely because my insurance company owns/is owned by CVS and only pays for meds thru them. Sooooo shitty.

I think about the germs in the sink and the shower. I think about the dirt on the floor. Thereâ€™s rust on the walls and ceiling, and black residue in between the crevices of the tub. The only solution I have found is to wear shower shoes, shower and brush my teeth with the lights off. Even then, thinking about touching my body or the surfaces in the bathroom make me nauseated. I sit on the couch all day and donâ€™t move because Iâ€™m too dirty to go anywhere, but I canâ€™t drag myself to the bathroom without feeling like Iâ€™m going to cry.

I was living in my own apartment for a few months, but I couldnâ€™t take care of myself. The thought of cleaning would disgust me, and I could only clean the bathroom once. I wouldnâ€™t wash my hair until I left for my grandmotherâ€™s, I wouldnâ€™t brush my teeth and shower for days at a time. 

I was raised by a hoarder, and we lived in squalor. The bathroom was never clean, the toilet would be grimey and broken. The tub would be gross, and the sink and floor would be cluttered. There was dirt packed in between the crevices and mice would run in the doorway. The condition of the hoard threw me into daily panic attacks, meltdowns, and tic fits, as my brain literally could not process information looking at the extreme mess. The gaslighting from the hoarder, and living in those conditions threw me into psychosis. I believe she is a narcissist.

I know I need professional help, but I donâ€™t know what kind of therapist I should seek. Iâ€™m falling apart, and I donâ€™t move all day. I want to start getting ready so I can start being productive.",bipolar_disorder

"My mother was diagnosed with bipolar and schizophrenia, however my dad sisters and I feel like it's BPD. I had a very traumatic childhood. When I was younger my mother and father would fight. My dad would yell all the time and come home angry. After my mother divorced my dad (for a completely fucked up reason) my dad was finally happy. He was the best father and only parent I really had. I am no longer taking to my mother and have cut her out of my life. I'm diagnosed bipolar. I'm deep down back of my head terrified that I'm gonna turn out to be like my mother. I lost my dad 2 weeks ago and it's been very very hard on me. I have been in a stable long term relationship with my boyfriend for 2 years, he's been amazing and as supportive as possible. But since my dad passed I feel like I'm reliving my mother and my dad's marriage. I can't make my brain voice shut up.

Me and this friend have always had on and off chemistry but he was never comfortable with his sexually to confront those feelings he told me (he is a trans man) and he just got out of a almost 2 year engagement almost 3 years total of dating and itâ€™s been 6 months since theyâ€™ve broken up and 2 weeks ago he kissed me and told me how he has had feelings for me in the past and that he wanted to try to grow a future with me once heâ€™s healed bc heâ€™s not over his ex and wanted to take baby steps with me because he rlly liked me and now 2 weeks later he is telling me that he doesnâ€™t want to cuddle or kiss or anything romantic bc heâ€™s just mot ready and doesnâ€™t know if he ever will be bc he said his ex was his soulmate and that he thinks about him every day and how much he misses him (they broke up because they kept having disagreements and his ex was very controlling of what he did including his work and his friends and time) and I know itâ€™s going to be a longer healing process for him since it was emotional abusive but the fact that he told me he wants to have a future with me and was telling all of his friends how much he liked me and all these other things to heâ€™s not ready for anything just hurts and itâ€™s like I have to go back to being just friends with him and sit there and act like I donâ€™t want to be holding his hand is hard:/ Iâ€™m just so hurt like I wish sometimes he wouldnâ€™t have even kissed me if he was just going to completely shut it down,bipolar_disorder

"When i was a teenager i was diagnosed bipolar 1, i went to therapy a bit, went on medication. Then i moved out of my moms house, thought i was better and like a lot of people, stopped therapy and went off my meds. I had been doing therapy for the past few months (until my son was born cuz newborn feeding schedules and all) well that therapist said im only bipolar 2 and dont need medication....

Recently my husband left the state for work so he can move us to a more preferable location. With him gone that obviously set me into a state of depression, but today i have extra energy, i didnt sleep much at all last night, and im talking to more people then usual.

My question is, is it possible for a bipolar 2 person to have dysphoric mania?",bipolar_disorder

"TW: &gt;!alcohol abuse!&lt;

Lack of sleep is my biggest mania trigger. And because of this new day job I got after being a bartender for the majority of the last 8 years (minus lockdown) I've struggled to get to bed early. I've been a night owl flsince I was 13 and would work until 3 am this past year.. before I had to quit my job for my mental health.

Because of this, I've been ecstatic. Life is finally going better for me after a hospital stay in May!!!!

I tend to self medicate with alcohol wayyyyy too often in addition to my morning Lamictal. I know it's terrible for this illness, but i really havent been able to drop it, unfortunately.

I also tend to have very long bouts of depression, with a mania that has lately been recurring right before my menstrual period. My hormones are completely out of whack. I should probably add an antipsychotic to the mix, but am in the US so without health insurance or even when I had ACA Healthcare, it has been impossible to afford to go to a psychiatrist. 

Anyway, to the hormone stuffffs with a lil segue:

I actually got my tubes removed recently so I'm now officially unable to have kids. For me and my situation, I'm so relieved. I have fear of pregnancy, &amp; I'm clearly irresponsible so it's for the better. (would be happy to adopt if I ever find myself in a more consistent healthy situation if i can kick my addiction) Having a baby grow in my body is not something I've ever wanted. That too has me kinda hyped up, especially after roe v wade and also the pain meds they gave me. (Haven't been taking them this week, though, and not to get into politics about prochoice or prolife, but my stance is perhaps obvious. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and we are here under the guise of our commonalities, not differences)

To the point:

Does anyone else experience a difference in mood when your hormones are raging? I'll get health insurance in a few months, so I plan to see an endocrinologist. This is getting out of my control and as I've gotten in my 30s, it has gotten worse ðŸ˜”

I'm happy to be happy and energetic, but know depression will come soon. Any response would be helpful. 

Wish me luck, yall. 

Hope you all are doing okay and staying safe!!! ðŸ’œðŸ’žðŸ’œ",bipolar_disorder
"I know someone will probably reply to this saying ""who cares what other people think"", but for anyone familiar with mental health issues, just because you know you shouldn't think a certain way, doesn't mean you can be successful at it. 

I've been diagnosed with PTSD, Major Depression, ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder and now Bipolar 2. I've been on Lamotrigine for a few weeks now to see how it goes, but I am finding it more and more frustrating how people treat me even though they are fully aware of my mental health issues. 

I have people regularly expect me to act like a ""normal"" person even though they have full knowledge of all the problems I deal with on a daily basis. Then when I don't act the way they want, they punish me for it, even though for the most part my mental illnesses are completely out of my control. 

I was wondering if anyone else has similar frustrations, whether it's work, personal life, family, etc. where people know what's wrong with you, but still expect too much from you. One person in my life who used to be an occupational therapist has regularly ridiculed me for not ""just being happy"".

"Tw: suicide and sa slightly mentioned 

I (19f) had an allergic reaction to buSpar. Itâ€™s super rare and thanks to my amazing luck I had one. 

On Monday I could barley breath. I felt like there was something in my throat and my chest was tight and I couldnâ€™t breath while talking or sitting up. I went to a patient first and they found nothing wrong so we assume it was the medication bc the chest tightness only started once I started the medication, I thought the symptoms would go away but it just plateaued at this point, itâ€™s no where near as bad as Monday but Iâ€™m still having pretty bad breathing problems. 

I went to a cardiologist nothing is wrong with my heart, I went to my pcp nothing is wrong with my lungs, no punctures, wheezing, signs of asthma, or fluid build up. I donâ€™t even smoke. 

I stopped taking it three days ago and Iâ€™m still experiencing shortness of breath when I walk around and sit up. Iâ€™m terrified it wonâ€™t go away. My doctor says it will take a week for it to fully get out of my system but Iâ€™m scared itâ€™s just caused irreversible damage. Which it probably didnâ€™t bc again no one could find anything wrong with my heart or lungs. However Iâ€™m still terrified, if my lungs donâ€™t get better Iâ€™ll loose my job (I work a manual labor job) I wonâ€™t be able to attend my college classes bc I can barley walk around my house (school doesnâ€™t offer online), Iâ€™ll probably never get a job in my career path bc my degree is a specific type of design degree that involves construction and painting and other shit,itâ€™s  very hard to get gigs when u start off in my career path that doesnâ€™t involve manual labor.

Not to mention I wonâ€™t be able to take care of myself bc I canâ€™t walk around and sometimes sit up without being out of breath, Iâ€™ll be stuck at home all the time, I canâ€™t make any money, I wonâ€™t have friendships or relationships, not to mention not anything psychical like sex or making out with a partner, no exercise, for god sake I can barley make a meal without getting winded. 

Iâ€™m a workaholic, I genuinely think my only reason to exist is to work and help other people, even that took me a lot to admit, it use to be I thought my main purpose was providing for a partner bc it was the only thing that ever brought me joy. 

In therapy Iâ€™ve been working past that and something that saved my life was working and education itâ€™s the only thing that drives me atm, without it I see no purpose. If I canâ€™t have that if I canâ€™t have my work or my education or take care of others I donâ€™t see the use of existing. I donâ€™t want to live with my parents for the rest of my life I love them dearly but Iâ€™ve always dreamed of taking care of myself and living alone being successful and making them proud.

 Iâ€™m already extremely insecure about that bc of being bipolar and having bpd. Before I went to college my dad was so proud of me, I got into a top ranked design school with a really intensive program. However during the whole first semester I was manic, having major depressive episodes dealing with rapid cycling (before I was diagnosed), and fighting anorexia. I had a psychotic break and my brain regressed into a child like state for a few hours so I was taken to an inpatient and held there bc I was high risk of self harm and suicide. I got diagnosed  there. As I said the only thing keeping me going was my education. After that I thought I wouldnâ€™t be able to take care of myself. The rapid cycling was so debilitating I couldnâ€™t do anything besides sit in my room. I thought Iâ€™d be stuck with my parents for the rest of my life because I was broken. I got better though and made a complete recovery from it, after I recovered lots of ppl said I sounded and acted way more mature than before and more in tune with myself so that was a plus. Shortly after my psychotic break I got sexually assaulted by my best friend and agin the only thing that got me through those dark times was education and working so I could be better than him and make something of myself while he eats shit bc being better than ppl that have wronged me is honestly the only thing thatâ€™s helped me get over betrayal like this, the step after that would be suicide. And because I donâ€™t want to do that Iâ€™m always pushing myself to be the best because if Iâ€™m going to do something Iâ€™m going to be the best at it.

I luckily got better from my psychotic break and over came the betrayal, Iâ€™m better than Iâ€™ve ever been. But if I donâ€™t have my physical health, the one thing Iâ€™ve always had the one that lets me function, even through the mania and the depression, if I canâ€™t walk around and force myself up to exercise while being depressed or work, Iâ€™ll most likely kms.Exercising and working saved my life, if I didnâ€™t do it while being depressed Iâ€™d quite literally be dead rn. 

The thoughts and insecurities from my psychotic break are coming back and manifesting into me not being able to breath. Iâ€™m scared, if I canâ€™t exercise or take care of myself while being mentally stable idk what Iâ€™ll be like during my next episode. Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m so fucking scared rn, all my suicidal thoughts are racing back into my head all the thoughts of letting my family down are coming back. They donâ€™t even care if I let them down, in fact Iâ€™m the golden child Iâ€™ve never let them down, which is why I feel this pressure. Iâ€™m just putting the pressure on myself but I just keep thinking back to when my dad said he was so proud of me bc I worked so hard and him crying because he was so fucking proud of me. I also get flash backs to the last time I saw him crying, when I was getting taken away by and ambulance to go to inpatient after I had confessed about how I was going to kill myself. I constantly compare those two memories, they are essentially the same but with different contexts to crying.

Iâ€™ve worked so hard my whole life to get where I am, my top ranking school one of the best in my class, hell I survived a psychotic break and assault and came out of it better and stronger. My last medication gave me seizures but that was less debilitating than this. But medication/exercise fixed the psychotic break and working helped me through the assault, nothing can fix this medication caused this. Now I have a fear of medications. I donâ€™t want to start or change anymore medications. I never grasped how dangerous it was until now even after I was driven into mania by SSRIs.

I donâ€™t really need people telling me, you need therapy, you need to have a different drive in life blah blah blah. My bpd makes me think my soul purpose in life is to emotionally, physically, and financially support the ppl around me. So the fact I was able to find another reason to live was a huge break through. But now that reason is slowly leaving my grasp. I have little things like my cat and my dad and my friends, but my brain wonâ€™t let them take care of me bc I want to take care of them.",bipolar_disorder
"I've come to learn in my 40's that my problem that plagued me my whole life was too much indulgence in the moment and delaying responsibility or work. What I mean by this is most of my life for whatever reason, I sought comfort in computer games, marijuana and alcohol, drugs, porn and anime, and spending money. It was such a lovely place to be and everything feels nice for the month or so. But during that time you neglect things that you should be doing, things that feel even SLIGHTLY inconvenient in the moment like returning a dirty plate to the kitchen, that's potentially 14 seconds of happy disngagement and I just want to keep the ride going. So what happens is a build up of all these things pile up and after about a month, they spill into reality. Emails, bills, work reponsibilities, lack of female attention, being overweight, completely messy household, lack of money, and then I generally go through a 2 week dark denial period  where I hide away and try and sleep away all my problems and just think dark thoughts about myself, and then finally at the last second on the clock before everything crashes I find the desperation to tidy everything and set my life back in order somewhat, just barely getting through work so I look ok. I do around 1 week of gym, healthy eating, tidying my room, learning a new skill, being social, and then I go ""look how amazing you are, you've earnt this pizza"" but then the pizza gets added with a show, and then I remember that the show is so much better stoned, and then after I watched the show, lets play the game that's fun, don't worry about tidying about this pizza box, you earnt this, look at how amazing you've done.

So does anyone else feel like their toxic / dysfunctional family triggers an episode or anything like that?
Now that Iâ€™m diagnosed with bipolar and PMDD and getting the therapy and help I need itâ€™s like Iâ€™m starting to see how dysfunctional and stressful my family is.

My husband and I are in marriage counseling which is great because our communication and the outside stress of his job (law enforcement), our kids, etc ,

Iâ€™m not perfect by any means as I have went through trauma therapy and was in an outpatient setting for alcohol in the past .  I donâ€™t drink like I used to. I feel like now I have a healthy way of looking at alcohol and I have my limit. A drink out at dinner , an occasional like a cookout or vacation.  And now with my medicine I am very very careful because I donâ€™t want any side effects from it with drinking. Itâ€™s scary .

However, my point here that Iâ€™m trying to make is itâ€™s like Iâ€™m turning a new lead and realizing my mom, sister, and brother are very very unstable . 


I donâ€™t want to blast them but itâ€™s to the point where they are adults and my sister has kids and they project their problems onto other people. Victim mentality to the max. 
Thereâ€™s times where I feel used and like Iâ€™m only talked to for convenienceâ€¦

I've been in absolute agony for the past week, ever since Roe v Wade was overturned.

Paranoia, irritability, crying spells, self disgust, guilt, sleep disturbances, the works. I've already gone through my SO's computer twice, despite knowing that I'm having irrational paranoia. I just can't seem to stop myself. He knows I do this and is so understanding that it makes me even more disgusted with myself.

He's the only one that knows what I've been going through. My best friends are my TTRPG group, but I hide so much of myself from them. I've been considering telling them that I'm taking a break. I haven't really been present at sessions in a few months and I feel so guilty about it, like I'm ruining everyone's good time.

I've been unemployed for over two years now, and I feel so worthless. I've applied for disability twice, but since we've been struggling to get me properly diagnosed I've been denied each time.

I'm also going through a med change right now so I may be having withdrawals. Also on my period. Very overwhelmed with doctors and vet appointments. I feel like I'm desperately trying not to drown or burn alive.

I know I need to contact my therapist, but I don't feel ready right now. I feel too overwhelmed to navigate my social anxiety in order to talk with her. I have my appointment Tuesday though so I'll definitely see her then.

"I'm 18/F and I have bipolar 1 + ADD. 

My intense mood swings in high school kept me from graduating, so I got my GED last year and started at college this spring. During spring semester, I ended up having the worst depressive episode I've had in over a year, so I wasn't able to put myself out there or meet many new people like I really wanted to. I've always wanted to join a sorority, so my main goal for this upcoming semester is to rush, but I'm starting to think that my bipolar might keep me from doing that. 

When my mood gets extremely low or high, I have psychotic symptoms. Even though I can hide them fairly well, they're noticeable. What if I'm talking to someone during recruitment but I *just know* they're reading my mind or manipulating me or they're a figment of my imagination or something ridiculous like that, and I end up lashing out or rambling some word salad gibberish in response? What if I do accept a bid but I drop into another deep depression and can't maintain my grades or social life so everything goes to shit again? I see all of my friends who've joined having a great time, and they had so much fun during the recruitment stage, but I'm terrified that if I just happen to have the wrong brain chemistry at the wrong time I'm going to ruin everything.  

This god damn disorder has destroyed my life over and over and now that I'm more mentally sound (thanks Wellbutrin) I desperately want to be the social, outgoing person I know I am, but was never able to be. I've been in therapy my whole life. I'm on meds. I can cope with my episodes. Why am I still not good enough to be myself? I just want to feel like everyone else.",bipolar_disorder

"TW Self Harm and Suicide  


I recently had a rough couple of years consisting of primarily depressive and mixed episodes.  I often would start engaging in suicidal behaviors but I had trouble believing I was suicidal.  It was this crazy catch-22... 

1.  I only wanted to go to the hospital if I was *actually* ill and suicidal
2. I didn't believe I was actually suicidal because I didn't successfully complete suicide
3. I couldn't tell anyone about my behaviours because I was obviously attention-seeking and I didn't deserve help because I wasn't *actually* suicidal because I hadn't completed suicide
4. Unfortunately, if I successfully completed suicide, then I couldn't access help because I would be dead.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I have been relatively stable for about a year now.  Each month has pretty much gotten better than the last in terms of stability.  This last month I have been realizing that the suicidality that I was experiencing was actually very severe and dangerous.  I had been minimizing the behaviors and thoughts I was having and I didn't understand why everyone else who knew about it was so worried.  Hindsight is 20/20 though, and I am shocked I survived this period in my life.  I was engaging in very scary behaviors and it is only by the grace of God that I am still alive today.  


So I am not sure if my thinking is common amongst people with bipolar (e.g. ""The only way I can prove I am suicidal to myself is if I complete suicide.  Anything else is a cry for attention"") but in case you are thinking this way - I assure that you should take your behaviours seriously.  They are likely far more severe than you realize.  Get help now - don't wait, don't minimize, just be honest and open with someone on your mental health team!",bipolar_disorder

Apparently, before that we were archaic sapiens and our way to express ourselves was limited to the very solid and essential. Then, nobody knows what happened, we became transcendental.

We created gods, myths, lies, hopeness, gossip, art. We started predicting the future, recreating the past, enjoying the present. 

Maybe bipolars work happened here... ðŸ˜

For sure, we died in the first depressive episode. Easily a wild animal ate us because we couldn't stand up to run away from the cave.

But the ones who survived until the maniac episode, oh boy, probably those were the ones who created the Communication Revolution. The ones who painted memes in the cave, who created the hunting tactics, who cheered up everybody to go on to the next place to live, who saw gods, spirits, shadows that didn't exist.

It's been almost 2 years since the last one ended and I'm seeing all the signs again: increased anxiety, mood swings, days where it's nigh on impossible to drag myself out of bed, stress twisted in knots through my whole body. The mask of normalcy is exhausting to maintain. Late this morning, for the first time since my last episode, I self-harmed.

" I donâ€™t remember the last time I showered. I am sure it was sometime this week, maybe 3 or 4 days ago? I have also been sleeping a lot, about 11 to 12 hours every night. My psychiatrist said it must be the medication. She asked me if I was slipping into depression. Yes, already have. I am not sad, there is nothing to be sad about. I donâ€™t feel hopeless either. I feel nothing extreme really. It a constant state of boredom and uncontrollable bodily laziness I cannot rid off. I keep slipping into this state of being. I thought for sure it would be manageable once I was with family. Itâ€™s not. I spend all day, everyday in bed and reluctantly come out in the evening when dad is home to avoid stress-induced conflicts and obsessive worrying from his end. 

I have my laptop open now. I went onto Viki and then Netflix, but I donâ€™t feel like watching anything. They remain open in the background. I have been researching bipolar disorder the past few days, do not feel like continuing that today. I feel lazy to eat, even. I just donâ€™t want to do anything, but I am bored out of my mind and need to do something, but my body will not let me. It does not listen to my requests or screams. My body does not give in to my mental frustration, it only exasperates it, eventually attaching itself to an overwhelming sense of emptiness. I feel but I donâ€™t feel. I love but I donâ€™t love. I care but I donâ€™t care. I feel it all but donâ€™t have the energy to actually do anything about it. Not even cry. Perhaps this is what evokes my desire to self-medicate with Mary Jane. It makes the boredom bearable. Time passes. But the problem is, it also furthers my emptiness. All I really have is a muddy conscience. My body is not mine, it has a mind of its own - a mind that I am disconnected from, one I have no access to. I am not sure how to rebuild the connection between my mind and the uncontrollable shell its residing in. 

Itâ€™s Friday today. Dada is sick, so there may not be any plans, which is what I am hoping for. If there are plans, I will have to get out of the house. I donâ€™t want to.

"Hi everyone, Iâ€™m a first time poster on reddit (long time lurker) and new to this subreddit. Iâ€™ve been taking Seroquel for about 7 years and have been weening off it for about a year, so Iâ€™m currently on 50mg. Iâ€™ve been taking lamotrigine as a mood stabiliser as well for the same amount of time. For exactly a week Iâ€™ve started on a new medication I hadnâ€™t heard of before which is Saphris, it tastes rubbish and you canâ€™t eat or drink for 10 minutes after dissolving under your tongue. 

Iâ€™m struggling with it though and need a place to vent I guess. Since starting it I was experiencing respiratory depression as a result of the two sedatives about 15 minutes after taking them. If you havenâ€™t experienced that before itâ€™s extremely unpleasant - like you canâ€™t get enough oxygen in. Because Iâ€™ve had this before with Seroquel at a higher dose I stopped taking it for two nights to see if it was actually the cause, and now Iâ€™m suffering from withdrawals. I havenâ€™t had the breathing issues since but I feel gross and also feel generally uncomfortable between the time I take Saphris until I manage to fall asleep. It makes me too tired to stay up but too restless to sleep. Iâ€™ve also been waking up at 3 am with unbearable paranoia since ceasing the Seroquel. 

I guess I need encouragement to push through or advice to manage the nausea. Has anyone tried Saphris? (Asenapine).

"In need of any kind of advice badly. I was diagnosed ADHD 12 years ago. After years of depressive/manic episodes I was diagnosed Bipolar 1, about five years ago. Since then I've been to hell and back, especially with medications for both disorders. After countless doctors, medications, therapy and various treatments I was ordered to take a genetics test.

The genetics test said I have genotypes that reduce response to certain ADHD meds, increased sensitivity to certain seretonin reuptake, decreased response to certain seretonin reuptake inhibitiors, reduced enzyme activity, reduced folic acid conversion and decreased serum levels.

Basically next to no medications work for me. They either jack me up or have no affect at all. Currently taking 30mg Adderall XR and it makes me feel like absolute garbage. It makes me feel like a zombie for about 2-3 hours then horrible depression when I come down. I hate taking it but it's 1 of 2 ADHD medications my POS insurance will cover. Also taking Lamictal 150 mg and it seems to do next to nothing. Went to 300 mg and I felt absolutely crazy. 

My birthday is coming up and the thought of getting another year older still stuck in this hell is so depressing. My Psych literally said she doesn't know what else to do. I don't either but I know I can't live like this. 

Does anyone have any similar issues with medications and know of anything that could possibly help? My Psychs only suggestion was folate supplement which I took for about 5 months and all it did was make me extremely sick my mind race even more.

"Despite my best efforts I still am having episodes, even though I've gotten better at managing symptoms and can get back to baseline faster. Sometimes it seems that even though I'm doing everything ""right"" (taking meds, therapy, getting 9 hrs of sleep, limiting work stress, eating healthy, regular exercise, no alcohol/drugs, daily mood charting, social outreach) I still have episodes-- more depression than mania these days-- sometimes inexplicably. It's annoying and gets in the way of things. 

Is this just the reality of living with bipolar? Chronic cycling broken up with some periods of remission, and a constant need to micromanage everything in your lifestyle/physiology to lessen the frequency and intensity of episodes?

Sounds exhausting.

"My parents are telling me I need to go to an inpatient bc my meds arenâ€™t working and Iâ€™ve been very close into being sent into full blown mania, but luckily I still had a logical side and Iâ€™m medicated to Iâ€™ve been keeping it at bay but now Iâ€™m going in and out of feeling the full extent of hypomania multiple times a day everyday. 

Itâ€™s been slowly happening more and more over he past two months so I really didnâ€™t see it coming. I had two very bad episodes I almost went to the er for one then I went to the er for the other and they did absolutely nothing for me even though I hadnâ€™t had water in 12 hrs bc my brain was telling me to keep my mouth shut and when ppl would try to open it my jaw would clench even worse. Now I donâ€™t want to go to the er if I have another episode bc they did absolutely nothing for me. But Ik I have to for my own safety. 

I have summer classes that end in two weeks and if I drop them now I would have had three months worth of work down the drain. So I was like Iâ€™ll go to inpatient after but then two weeks after the end of those classes I have to go back to college. So I have to go now if I want to go to college. 

The only solution I see is getting all my work done before I go back to the inpatient and email my summer class teachers whatâ€™s going on. I just needed to vent ig or maybe support. Iâ€™ve never dealt with the manic aspect of bipolar before only a few times. I never realized how draining it is. I canâ€™t even function in my own house. At least with depression I could push myself to talk and work but Iâ€™ll have one interaction with someone and I feel euphoric and donâ€™t shut up and Iâ€™m about to vomit from the jolts of energy. Itâ€™s gotten to the point where eating food sends me into a euphoric episode so Iâ€™ve been avoiding food bc Iâ€™m just so tired of this. I havenâ€™t gone to work in two weeks.

So 2 weeks ago i had an extremely stressful week, i was out everyday and i was so emotionally exhausted and stressed i cried many times.

For the past week and a half ive been switching between depressed/mixed/hypomania alot.

But ill tell you the one instance today.

i decided i wanted to be an actor, i was so sold on this i made a profile on â€˜backstageâ€™ for actors. I did my hair&amp;makeup and set up lightening and took many headshots to put on my profile. I watched videos on how to make an acting profile. And set mine up with my bio and headshot and was about to take some videos of me acting

But then i start grieving my law dream, i thought i cant be a lawyer when im travelling the world and dedicating all my time to acting.

This whole thing lasted about 2 hours max, i feel asleep after getting sad about law- ive woke up and thought what was i doing??

I dont know what really happened or why i wanted to be an actor but now im like none of my other hypomania lasts an hour?

"I got new medication a while ago, and I feel like a normal person. I wake up not hating myself or wishing I was dead, and Iâ€™m not so manic that Iâ€™m packing boxes to move to another country or buying everything I see. Iâ€™ve been exercising for the first time in my life and enjoying it. All of these are good things, great things even. 
Hereâ€™s the problem, I donâ€™t know how to act as a â€œnormalâ€ person. For a really long time â€œdepressionâ€ was a part of my identity. I didnâ€™t think there would be a day I would wake up and not hate myself or my life. Now that I have that, Iâ€™m confused. In a way, being sad or manic was better because it was comfortable for me, familiar. 
Itâ€™s causing a rift between my partner and I. Heâ€™s always had to take care of me, remind me to take a shower and brush my teeth, make sure I actually eat, etc. Now I donâ€™t need that from him and he seems almost upset about it. I know heâ€™s happy for me, but itâ€™s a big change from where I was 6 months ago. Weâ€™ve been together for 6 years, and this is the first time heâ€™s ever seen me manage my own self care properly. I understand why he would be kind of upset as it is a big change, but I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know how to act as a â€œnormalâ€ human being. Will he get used to it? 
Like the person he fell in love with was a walking disaster waiting to happen. Mental breakdowns once a week, crying, panicking, needing help with literally everything. Iâ€™m not that person now, but thereâ€™s a part of me that thinks he loved me in part because he got to take care of me and now I donâ€™t need that. He wants a partner he can take care of and protect and I have never been someone who wants that. Truthfully I hate being taken care of but before it was necessary, now itâ€™s justâ€¦ annoying? 
And then, of course, there are the times when I still get a little manic, where I think to myself â€œI donâ€™t need anyone anymore so I should just move out and live alone so I can figure out myself as a normal person.â€ Which is dumb, I know.
I dunno. I know itâ€™s a good thing to be more managed and more in control. But I really didnâ€™t think I would get better and now that Iâ€™m working on it, itâ€™s almost scarier than being manic and depressed. At least I was used to it before. 
Any advice on how to handle any of this? Thank you.",bipolar_disorder
"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 12 years ago, and have been treated by 5 different psychiatrists over this time period. However, I've never had to ""break up"" with any of them; each transition was out of necessity, because the previous doctor either left the practice/field, or moved out of state. So this is kind of embarrassing after so much time in treatment, but I'm not exactly sure what the ""proper"" or polite way is to let a psychiatrist know that I won't be using their services anymore. I'm looking for advice and would like to know how others have handled this situation. 

More details: 

I've been seeing my current psychiatrist for about 6 years, and she's been perfectly fine, but ever since the pandemic happened and the psychiatry practice switched to remote appointments, the front office staff has been a disaster. They can't seem to retain staff, so every time I talk to someone there it's a new person. They're difficult to get a hold of for insurance/billing issues. I was understanding at the beginning of the pandemic, because everyone was scrambling to adjust, but it's over two years later now and things haven't really improved with them. 

There are some other minor reasons why I'm considering a change. For example, my current doctor's schedule isn't the most convenient for me, because she doesn't offer any appointment times after 1 pm. I'm also growing weary of remote appointments, and would maybe like to switch to a doctor who is offering in-person appointments at this time. 

So how would I go about making this change? Should I meet with a candidate new doctor first, to make sure I ""click"" with them before officially letting my current doctor know that I'm switching? Is this proper procedure? My anxiety over how to handle this has been holding me back, so I'd like to hear others' thoughts!",bipolar_disorder
"Let me preface this by stating that I am NOT looking for a diagnosis. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and am interested in speaking to my psychiatrist about bipolar disorder. 

For those of you with diagnosed bipolar disorder, how often do you tend to go from manic to depressed? From what I've read, it seems that phases tend to be weeks long. Is this the case for most of you? 

I often experience pretty severe mood changes but it's quick. I'll go from feeling angry and vengeful to happy and carefree in the span of 15-20 minutes, just back and forth. This is especially prevalent when I'm feeling a very strong way about something. 

I absolutely understand that changes in mood are not the only symptom. I'm just curious if others experience these quick changes, and if it COULD potentially be a sign of something.

"I'm afraid I'm slipping into a mixed episode and I never had one before.

Last week(s) I was doing fine and slowly feeling more at peace. I have bipolar unspecified with rapid cycling and a few other things. 

However, Sunday I started to feel really agitated with everyone and everything. I also had a really bad night. Monday at work I was angry and cranky and snappy to my coworker who I share my office with. I apologized this morning but when talking about it I started crying and felt really bad about myself. He said maybe I should go home considering how I felt, but I decided to stay at work. Later that morning I was euphoric, hyper and in the end I stayed longer at work to finish some thing and I felt really productive. When I got home I suddenly starting to feel suicidal and how I don't want to do this anymore and cried again. I then went for some grocery shopping and suddenly snapped/yelled at someone who wanted to ask me something.
My point: My mood is really angry/agitated all the time and it changes suddenly. I don't have control over my emotions since I started crying at work today. I also had two bad nights out of nowhere. This is not normal behavior for me and I'm ashamed and scared to go to work again with this mood. 

I know anger/irritability might be sign of mania, but I only know the 'out of control'/euphoric manic. I think I'm heading to a mixed episode or something? Does anyone had experience with this, could this be the start of an episode?

I am ravenous on this drug, and I canâ€™t seem to satisfy it. I binge consistently. I had no issue in my relationship with food until I knew I would be craving at night. 

At first, I stopped buying snack food. Eventually I cut out meat, dairy, bread, everything other than produce so that I do not have access to it past 9pm when I take the drug.

I used to be on it for only about a month at 25 mg. I know for a lot of people it's a miracle med (wished I'd stayed on it longer before) but better late than never right? 

Hoping I have the same effects that others do, and can finally lose all the med weight without lithium weighing me down, no pun intended lol. 

Weening off the lithium though I do not like. Lightheaded, still the mild headache, and my eyes feel weird. My head feels almost like I'm buzzed. Not sure if that's normal. But excited for this new chapter and hopes that I can finally feel balanced. :)",bipolar_disorder

"BP 1 here. My anxiety has been really bad lately. My doctor wonâ€™t add a daily benzo because of the addiction risk, which is fine. Iâ€™ve tried buspar in the past which didnâ€™t work and gave me insomnia. 

My doctor wants me to try Zoloft 25mg despite the mania risk due to the AP and mood stabilizer I already take. Iâ€™m not sure because Iâ€™ve been stable for a year and really fear another episode. 

What are everyoneâ€™s thoughts on this? Is it a risk you would take? The anxiety is so bad I would say it definitely interferes with my life and negatively impacts my quality of life. I do my best to avoid the news and other anxiety triggers, but I also have OCD so itâ€™s difficult. 

Has anyone had success treating anxiety with a low dose of antidepressant?",bipolar_disorder
"I was diagnosed with Bipolar I at the age of 19, and switched from antidepressants to the suitable mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. The meds seem to help sometimes, or at least stave off the worst of the psychosis, but right now that's about all they are doing.

For the past 6 months or so, I have been in the worst depression I have ever experienced. I am catatonic maybe half of my days, spending up to 20-22 hrs a day in bed. I weep constantly. My self image and self esteem are lower than low. The hopelessness and empty feelings are all I can feel/think about most of the time.

Naturally I still have my bipolar cycles tho, so every 1-2 months I have 1-2 weeks of extreme mania; I go wild. I sleep about 4 hours every 3 days. I get so impulsive that I do dangerous things like having risky sex with strangers or spending money I don't really have. My ego is inflated to the point that I'm rude/mean to other people for no reason. The worst of myself comes out, and I feel like my true self is stuck watching from the sidelines unable to prevent my body &amp; mouth from doing what they're doing.

Does anyone else have experience with this type of cycling? I've never had this bad of extremes happen for this long of a time period, and I'm extremely concerned at this point. I am in treatment (2 therapists &amp; a psychiatrist) and take my 6 medications as directed every day (20mg abilify + 75mg lamictal + 900mg gabapentin + 4mg prazosin + an antihistamine and a beta blocker for anxiety symptoms). I am considering a partial hospitalization program at the moment to get me a higher level of care, but I'm scared even that won't help. 

Help! Does anyone have any tips on breaking out of really deep persistent long term depressive episodes without rocketing myself into mania?? I'm at my wits end. Sympathy, experiences, and advice are welcome.",bipolar_disorder
"I'm a 23F and I was diagnosed with BD when I was 16. I've been on and off with my meds, but I'm finally at a place where I am taking them consistently. Lamotrigne really has been the best medicine I've been on. Recently I got really bad depression (I hadn't had an episode like this in two years). I was mean to my family, to myself, to myself and hated all my friends. I let my room get really bad, and I gained about 12lbs. The weight gain is what gets to me the most. I lost my semi healthy habits and now I have to start from zero again. Does this happen to anyone else? You get severe depression and you gain a ton of weight. Not to mention I have a doctors appointment soon and I will most definitely get the over weight lecture.",bipolar_disorder
"So I have been in therapy since my first manic episode. I don't feel I need it but go to it, because my phycatrist wants me to. My therapist I had recently left the practice to start her own and does not accept my insurance. That's cool I'll find a new one at the same firm.

Today my first meeting with my new therapist was rescheduled, without calling to notify me or ask me if the new time was appropriate for me. I received an email a few hours before the appointment that it has been rescheduled. 

This rubbed me the wrong way. I have no relationship with this person and it was supposed to be our first introduction. Needless to say I cancled that appointment. If she cannot be professional with me I don't need to see her. I like my schedules and I like professionalism. I felt it was rude of her to do because the rescheduled time she put in for I have another appointment at. 

Am I wrong to feel this way or is that an appropriate reaction to what happened. Or was she the one who didn't go through the proper channels when rescheduling without proper notification. Thank guys!!",bipolar_disorder

No, you don't. You don't know what it's like because *you don't have bipolar disorder*. The comparison of anxiety to a manic episode is nothing because they arent the same thing. Why can't you just let me vent without trying to make it about you?",bipolar_disorder
"I [23M] will likely be diagnosed with rapid cycling BP2 here soon. With my experiences Iâ€™ve detailed to my doctor, family history, and my Daylio chart, itâ€™s become obvious to both my doctor and I. However, one thing that Iâ€™m terrified of telling my doctor, something Iâ€™ve hid from him, is my paranoia and my psychotic episode I had back in high school. 

Iâ€™ll spare the details of my psychotic episode, but I wasnâ€™t hospitalized. Well, I did go to the hospital. But I was never admitted. They just took urine/blood samples. But ever since then, Iâ€™ve been terribly scared of the dark. When my boyfriend isnâ€™t sleeping with me, I always sleep with a light on and I check if the door and windows are locked like 10 times and, if my paranoia is really bad, Iâ€™ll either have to clear every room in the apartment or just stay awake until the sun comes up. Additionally, I always have to check behind the shower curtain before doing anything in the bathroom.

"Hey there, Iâ€™m pretty confused about something because Iâ€™m currently tested for a bipolar diagnosis but I donâ€™t know much about it and Google seems not to give me a 100% answer. I want to explain to my psychiatrist whatâ€™s happening but itâ€™s so hard to filter my thoughts and come up with descriptions about my symptoms because what is even real? I would say Iâ€™m currently in a hypomanic episode for over a week now. I had my appointment before I got hypomanic (donâ€™t think itâ€™s a manic one) so I actually went there because of feeling depressed. I sleep for maybe 5 hours every single night, I have racing thoughts and Iâ€™m always socialising, looking for dates, high energy, talking fast, feeling like nothing can stop me, risky behavior because I have no problem with doing drugs then although I would never do it when not in this state. 

So yeah what Iâ€™m trying to say is that these things were always pretty normal to me because I live with them for a few years now. But this time something feels different. Reality just seems odd to me? I have no concept for time, everything feels VERY unreal as things donâ€™t actually happen and Iâ€™m questioning them all the time. Sometimes I completely shut out. Itâ€™s like feeling dizzy but also not actually feeling dizzy? I donâ€™t know. At some times I see bright lights or circles right before I go to sleep which makes me a bit uncomfortable and I donâ€™t really know if theyâ€™re really there or if I have problems with my eye sight. I developed panic attacks a few months ago with the same feeling of dizziness but itâ€™s just feels different now because Iâ€™m not really panicking anymore. Iâ€™m just pissed because I canâ€™t fall asleep because everything feels so weird and unreal. What could it mean? Is this even a thing with Bipolar? This can go hours. 

I also went to the hospital last week because I felt my body giving up and every time I tried to lay down at night, I got this uncomfortable feeling and startled from falling asleep. Before this happened I drove home from my friend and saw everything on the street 3 times. Sorry English is not my mother language. I hope itâ€™s quite understandable!

"Posted this in r/hairloss but I figure someone might have had a similar experience here.

Male in his early 40s here.

About ten years ago I started a medication (lithium) which triggered a problem with my thyroid, which I went on another medication (Eltroxin) to treat.

Soon after the thyroid diagnosis, my hair started to thin and eventually a bald patch at the back.

I've now come off the first medication and it seems like my thyroid is recovering and I'm coming off Eltroxin too. I've noticed a recent initial change in that when I shower there are virtually zero hairs coming off my head when I wash, when in the past there would be strands of hair in my hands every time I wash.

I've read a few medical articles and they suggest that my hair has a chance of recovering. I'm just wondering if anyone has been through the same and could share their experiences? If my hair is indeed recovering is there anything I can do to help it, with medication or other treatments?

Unstable like just not in control of my life. I blow up, I'm impatient, I just fkg hate life while it's my dream job. 

Another part of it is other human beings. I don't trust them, I don't trust myself, I seek constant validation, my self esteem is so low. Every time someone speaks to me, I get annoyed and on anxiety mode. Like I will put on a mask and act like I'm happy and nice and sweet. I'm realizing right this minute that... I always thought I'm super expressive, while I'm not. I'm just acting. Over doing it. 

I'm saying all this because recently my boyfriend brought up that he doesn't know what to believe of me anymore. That my actions don't go in the same direction as my words and he's confused. He's always anxious that I'm saying something is ok while it is not. 

I can't act like I truly am because people will not like me. I would be bored and tired, I don't want anyone to talk to me. I don't know what to say when they talk to me. 

Anyways, today I'm seeing a psychiatrist for the first time in a long time. I probably have ADD they will place me on Vyvanse or SMT like that.

It doesnâ€™t help that I just got dumped and it was my first anything in four years. Can anyone offer any mood management advice at all, and granted Iâ€™m not an extreme case, like not a risk to others",bipolar_disorder
"Hey everybody,

I was feeling low today, so I made a playlist. I put equal emphasis on lyrics and music; therefore, if some of the lyrics don't quite make sense for bipolar disorder, that's why. Hope you like it!

If the link doesn't work, let me know. I don't have much experience with sharing playlists on Apple Music.",bipolar_disorder
