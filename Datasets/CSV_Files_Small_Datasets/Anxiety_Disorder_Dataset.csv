"Today, I had a problem with my boss and a friend. We were nervous. My boss was furious about something but I defended myself and he became calm. Before that, he shouted. I managed to overcome it. I expressed my opinion, thought very well. I didn't disrespect.

Actually, We don't overcome the problem but It doesn't matter anymore. The object is not the problem, or my boss, friend. The object is me and my anxiety. 

If it had happened a few years ago, I probably would cry and suffered anxiety crisis for days. Today, I'm relax. Because I know myself.

I have moral codes, others don't have moral codes and they don't realize that.

I've tried to establish moral codes. Today, I realize I did it and I didn't compromise my moral codes.

I have one life. We have one life.

Anyway, I'm proud of myself.",Anxiety
"So my sister recently recovered from omicron Covid a week ago. Today she went to a packed cinema to see spider man, and tomorrow sheâ€™s coming over for New Years, and we are going to be in a small car together for a few hours as well as partying. Everyone is going to be doing tests but Iâ€™m wondering, if she has just recovered and is basically immune to covid, can she still transmit the virus to me if she was exposed at the cinema? There was no social distancing but you had to wear a mask throughout - I have the option of staying away from her if I want to which Iâ€™m leaning towards but I want to know the relative risk? What do you guys think, how much risk is there for this?",Anxiety
"How long did it take you to get your first appointments?

I know I need to start therapy. I thought I had my anxiety under control but in the last few weeks it has skyrocketed. I know itâ€™s high time I start talking to someone about it. But every single person I called is not accepting new patients. 

It feels like Iâ€™m never meant to get this under control.",Anxiety
"Waking up is such a normal thing to, right? Suffering from depression is one thing but this morning I woke up in a panic attack. This went on for several hours and they just didnâ€™t pass. After I could finally catch some sleep in the afternoon , I started to have an insane craving for sweets/chocolate. Is there anyone else who ever experienced this cravings after an episode? Tips and tricks on how to deal with this when you are sort of not awake yet would be great!",Anxiety

"Hi everyone. I took a COVID test this morning bc my brother has been sick. It was a home rapid test. My test came out negative, and my brotherâ€™s was positive. I have stayed pretty far away from him even in the house bc he was coughing/had a runny nose. His was positive however. Now I canâ€™t stop overthinking about â€œdid I push the swab back far enough? Am I really negative or is it false? Did I touch the correct part of my nose?â€ This just fucking sucks.",Anxiety
"Hey there! So New Years Eve is coming and I was invited to a party I actually don't want to go to because everyone else is gonna be with their significant other and I'm gonna be alone feeling alone. I'm in my 20s and I never had a relationship. I went on dates, talked to guys, had crushes and being someone's crush but I just don't feel safe in a relationship with a guy. I'm always anxious. had a traumatic childhood so it could be that lol. I mean I'm on therapy but it just sucks I can't enjoy relationships like a normal young woman without feeling so shitty and anxious.... I would like to have fun too and not feel this low ðŸ˜ž",Anxiety
"In short, I have struggled with reflux 2 years ago and it has been mainly impacting my voice and making my voice hoarse. I am a singer and itâ€™s an absolute depressing shit. I canâ€™t sing and I canâ€™t be reliable as a singer coz reflux happens whenever. I noticed when I hyper fixated on it, it got worse and I did an endoscopy and it turned out that I have a small hiatal hernia. The doc says that it shouldnâ€™t be a cause for the symptoms and stress can be a factor. I have tried everything possible and the docs donâ€™t seem to help. I donâ€™t know what is causing what anymore. Is my crazy health anxiety causing my reflux or is actually there? Mind you that I have only had symptoms 2 years ago appear when my anxiety started to heighten. Should I go to therapy to get my anxiety under control?",Anxiety
"so iâ€™m actively at war with my own brain right now. Iâ€™m very prone to panic attacks when iâ€™ve been awake for too long and iâ€™m tired, and on top of that i just took a walk around the neighborhood which triggered a) social anxiety, b) raging headache, and c) heart rate increase (which makes me anxious). So my headache started freaking me out, and I felt that familiar bodily swimming sensation and tightening in my chest, and for just a few moments i felt like I was actively dying and started panicking. But now Iâ€™m kind of in this battle with myself. I calm down a bit and start to feel more at ease, and then a new sensation kicks up. Just as Iâ€™m writing this my muscles are clenching and Iâ€™m beginning to shake. Itâ€™s likely adrenaline-induced tremors, but itâ€™s only gonna exacerbate my anxiety response and make it harder for me to get a handle on this. I *know* Iâ€™m not in any danger. Iâ€™m in good health. I am okay. I am physically well. But my brain canâ€™t seem to get the memo. If I keep getting these I really think I could do with some beta blockers or something. Itâ€™s absolutely the worst fucking feelingâ€”the terror and dread and soul-gripping panic of it. Anxiety attacks are the fucking worst and I just want it to stop. PLUS iâ€™m at my dadâ€™s house and I have to pretend Iâ€™m 100% normal and fine cause i sure as fuck canâ€™t tell him. I have no clue how heâ€™d react. He might get mad at me for all i know; heâ€™s not very predictable. I think writing this all out is helpful. Headache is still there kinda. Still shaking. As long as I donâ€™t focus too hard on my psychical feelings, I should be okay. Something about odd/uncomfortable/painful sensations makes me panic a lot of the time. maybe itâ€™s the feeling that iâ€™m trapped, like i canâ€™t escape my body. now i think Iâ€™m calming down and getting betterâ€¦ but you never know. It always comes in waves. I could be way worse in a minute. deep breaths. I am okay. Itâ€™s all in my head. I am physically safe and healthy. I am okay. Itâ€™s all in my head. deep breaths. okay. well this is just way too fucking long now lmao.",Anxiety
"Yesterday my girlfriend and I went to drive snowmobiles and I ended up driving most of the way because she wasnâ€™t a huge fan of driving it.

We made it all the way through our trail and turned back around. When we were leaving it was pretty late in the day (at least late enough to get off the snowmobiles, as the sun went down and this trail wasnâ€™t lit up) the paths had become pretty bumpy.

I tried to stay to the right of the trail with the left ski hitting the bumps and the right ski in the softer snow to lessen impact on bumps. I veered to far to the right and we ended up flipping into some pretty deep snow. 

My girlfriend fell on top of me and I couldnâ€™t breath for a few seconds under the snow. Luckily no one was hurt but it scared the shit out of me. Im extremely claustrophobic so that also definitely didnâ€™t help. 

My family was riding p close behind and within 5 minutes or so they helped us out, but my mind keeps racing with the what ifs. I just keeping thinking about how badly I couldâ€™ve hurt my girlfriend, or even killed her. 

What if the snowmobile hadnâ€™t become lodged in the snow and had rolled on top of us or what if I had fallen on top of her and she couldnâ€™t get out. No way sheâ€™d be able to lift me off, especially if I had somehow been knocked unconscious or something. There were times I was going a lot faster and there was times I had ventured off without my family. Thereâ€™s just so many what ifs I canâ€™t stop thinking about.

It was a genuinely an accident but my anxiety is so bad rn and I canâ€™t stop obsessing over what could have happened",Anxiety
"She's been off her meds since the start of the pandemic and her anxiety has only gotten worse. Minor inconveniences trigger panics that result in her yelling at me . 

I feel I have done everything i can to be understanding and sympathetic, but it's really grinding me down and affecting my mental health. I'm a regular unemotional guy, but her breakdowns are starting to make me cry.

I love her to much to leave her, but something needs to change. Her insurance starts up January 1st, so there is some hope for meds, but i really think therapy is required.... i have no clue how to have that conversation.

"I'm a 35 year old man, have had failed relationships due to anxiety and mental health issues but still try and keep up the hope of finding the one and having one child someday. I can usually come to terms with either yes it'll happen or no it won't and either way is okay...

But my LORD the input from friends, family, even strangers. You'll regret never having kids, you'll regret having kids, you're too young to decide not to want to have kids, you're too old to have kids, you definitely need to have two, you definitely need to have three, only children are spoiled so don't just have one (have had this said to me so many times by people not knowing that I myself am an only child). Like what is with people and this specific topic of family/life planning that people feel completely entitled to make their own judgement on over, and over, and over. It never ceases to both amaze me, and trigger my anxiety to no end. It's like people aren't happy unless you're afraid of not doing it the way they think it should be done. I could count the number of times someone has ever said anything positive and affirming about having or not having kids. It's always about something you should be worried about.

The reason I'm writing this is because I just went to visit an older lady, work friend of mine, and her older (sixtyish) husband suggested I might be too old to have kids when I told her I wanted one. And went on a rant about how ohhh you'll be 55 when they're twenty, you won't get to relax until then. It never ends. Jesus christ.",Anxiety
"When my anxiety is ramping up I get the stomach tightness.. heart palpitations and throat clenching as well that prickly feeling And sweats. Feels awful so in the past I've taken .25 mg  Klonopin and distracted myself and it helped but I don't want to depend on Klonopin... And try not to take .25 mg on back to back days.

"Since a traumatic episode late august Iâ€™ve just been so messed up.  Iâ€™m feeling great for two to three weeks, then Iâ€™m inevitably hit with it.  All encompassing anxiety where Iâ€™m crying all day, shaking, canâ€™t leave the bed, and the worst part is the nausea and vomiting.  For a week my body doesnâ€™t want me to eat, until I start to calm down and then slowly get back to normal, only for the cycle to occur again in a couple of weeks.  I changed meds, I do therapy, I do everything Iâ€™m supposed to.  But recovery is just out of my reach and I donâ€™t know why and with this latest lapse I am just feeling so utterly despondent and scared and overwhelmed that I canâ€™t stop crying.

"Hi friends! This past year has been a wild on and off ride. Lately the past month Iâ€™ve had, logically, increased anxiety with some unbearable symptoms lately. I developed health anxiety at start of year but itâ€™s slowly gotten alittle worse. Iâ€™ve been on and off meds to try to see what works, most of them I donâ€™t think I gave them enough time and was kinda worried going on and off them was screwing up brain chemistry but that may not be the case, it could be legitally my anxiety has just gotten worse over time. 
Anyways, I was taking buspar then my anxiety got hella worse with Liek this weird jump out of skin impending doom feeling thatâ€™s constant, I canâ€™t ever fully relax and itâ€™s almost like I feel this intense aura in my body like somethings about to strike me or I feel detached like Iâ€™m about to lose control of my body and the inside of my just wants to freak out for no reason. It always feels Liek something is about to strike me in the head or soemthing if that makes sense and I developed intrusive thoguhts of my losing control and hitting myself in the head or something. Weird I know. I also have ocd and of course I donâ€™t want to do these things but itâ€™s gotten severe the past month and recently I decided to give an ssri a try, only just finished 3 weeks. Iâ€™m trying to learn to try not to fear all this stuff and yes Iâ€™ve talked to a therapist about all this that diagnosed me with ocd and gad. My body just feels in constant fear and over awareness and trying to find ways to rewire this as Iâ€™m taking a med for it. Any tips?",Anxiety
"DAE have obsessions with people they like? I always thought I was pretty normal until I realized how horrible my anxiety was and that most people do not think like me. My issue is when I am attracted to a guy I get very obsessive. My whole personality revolves around them. Even if we break up I will constantly stalk their social media to try to understand whatâ€™s going on - analyze EVERYTHING. Itâ€™s soooo unhealthy and makes me miserable. I am currently in therapy and took Lexapro to help, neither of these stop not my obsessions. I understand my thought pattern needs fixing and I have tried to fix it through positive coping mechanisms such as working out, meditating, distracting myself but i physically and emotionally go through panic attacks, deep depression if I do not stalk their social media. It is almost as if I am losing myself/mind. I know this sounds wild but I have been going through this with many different people since I was 13 years old (Iâ€™m currently 21). I have gone years of obsessing over guys Iâ€™ve been with even after we had broken up years before. I feel like I donâ€™t know who I am bc Iâ€™m over analyzing someoneâ€™s elseâ€™s life. In order to stop the obsession With one guy I need to find the next. If they arenâ€™t happy Iâ€™m 10x more unhappy. My thoughts and feelings revolve around them. Iâ€™m never happy anymore and canâ€™t live with myself. It sucks so bad. Can anyone relate? Does anyone know why Iâ€™m like this? Is this just anxiety? Does everyone have this problem? I just really need help.

I should mention thereâ€™s been twice in my life where I wasnâ€™t obsessed with another person and during those times I was obsessed with my health and got really bad health anxiety that led me to four different ER visits. Also, I experienced depersonalization/derealization (scariest shit Iâ€™ve ever been through in my life).My parents think Iâ€™m nuts.",Anxiety

I've been too anxious to drive since april (and even then, I only got behind the wheel because my country makes you do a safe driving course if you want to keep your license) .  
It's been a huge waste of money, my grandpa will be selling his (more expensive) car and taking mine, and if I ever REALLY need it I can still use it

"It's frustrating how much avoidance takes a toll on my life situation. Has someone said something in a slightly rude tone? I better not talk to them ever again. Made a tiny mistake at work? How about I don't show up the next day and continue to do so until they fire me. I'm tired of it.

"It feels as though social anxiety has robbed me of my intelligence. I often downplay how much I know, or fail to articulate my words. At work, Iâ€™m 99% sure my coworkers think Iâ€™m dumb as a door nail. Iâ€™m constantly talked down to like a child or snapped at. This just makes me feel more anxious, because now, I donâ€™t want to speak. I stay quiet most of the time, rarely making conversation because I know Iâ€™ll mess everything up. But then thereâ€™s this awkward silenceâ€¦ 

I also tend to choke on my words or canâ€™t form a complete sentence because Iâ€™m so nervous that jibberish just comes out instead. Itâ€™s gotten to point where I want to quit my job due to the intense feelings of shame and inadequacy. I wish I could prosper in this work environment but Iâ€™m not.

is it normal to constantly live in anxiety/fear? i've lived with anxiety since i can remember and it's never been as bad as it's been the past like 5 years (19m). i get anxiety over things as simple as seeing as dumb as it sounds. i can feel myself see it feels like sometimes and like i get this impending doom feeling come over me. i have terrible night terrors which greatly effects my daily life by getting flashback type rushes that come over me where i see/feel what i feel at night when i wake up and i'm constantly battling myself to keep calm and not freak out. no one would be able to tell but it's subtle and always there,Anxiety

Itâ€™s normal for me to be anxious. But this level of anxiety for me is unheard of.

Anyway, I also have whatever the fear of vomiting is called (I canâ€™t spell it or remember the name) and as such, I unintentionally mistake nausea from not eating/anxiety with nausea from sickness, even though Iâ€™m (physically) fine.

I guess my big thing is Iâ€™m scared if I eat normally (Iâ€™ve only eaten crackers and a few chips for a week) Iâ€™ll throw up, and the thought of that makes me more anxious and as such, more nauseous from anxiety.

"i have cptsd, and an anxiety disorder so anxiety is not foreign to me. but i have obtained a new obsession; checking my BP, and my pulse with a pulse oximeter. i am 19, male, and overweight. i donâ€™t exercise, i barely leave my room. but my heart rate at resting is as low as 50 sometimes. this morning i woke up, and first thing i did was check my pulse. it was 44. i know that your heart is at its lowest when you are sleeping because that is true relaxation, at least thatâ€™s what iâ€™ve been told. but i think what iâ€™m having trouble coming to terms with is how iâ€™m so unhealthy, and overweight, yet have such a low resting heart rate. whatâ€™s crazy about the pulse oximeter is i can check my pulse, see itâ€™s 54 or something, have a wave of panic, and literally watch the numbers go up. within 30 seconds it will be at 120. thatâ€™s how i know everything is working properly ahahaha. when iâ€™m having a panic attack, my pulse can get up to 150. so, in conclusion, iâ€™m just basically asking to hear someone elseâ€™s opinion and iâ€™m asking that you be gentle because i am a very fragile minded person. thanks for reading this and please give me your thoughts.",Anxiety

"I just posted about my anxieties regarding my dental care on the AskDentist subreddit but after writing all that I went and called 8 different dentists.

Place 1: Sorry, 80% of our staff quit due to COVID so we have no appointements available unless it's an emergency.
Place 2: Sorry, your insurance's website only says we take your insurance because our pediatric orthodontist does but no one else here does.
Place 3: Sorry, we only take bookings 6 weeks in advance and we're booked for those 6 weeks currently.
Place 4: Sorry, we only take your insurance if you're pregnant or a child.
Place 5: &lt;phone disconnected&gt;
Place 6: Sorry, we're closed for the holidays (and my partner told me they've talked to this particular place and they're booked through to the summer). 
Place 7: Sorry, we actually only cover children and pregnant women, which is not on our website for some reason.
Place 8: &lt;phone disconnected&gt;
Place 9: &lt;phone disconnected&gt;

And that's every place I can find that takes my insurance. So my options are 1. keep trying place 3 every Monday when their schedules open up to try to grab an appointment, 2. try to get a summer appointment at place 6 and hope nothing goes wrong with my teeth in the meantime, or 3. pay out of pocket. I can probably afford a checkup and cleaning but I'm terrified I have like 18 cavities that I definitely can't afford to deal with without insurance.

I have bad health anxiety and I've never taken good care of my teeth because ADHD + severe depression = terrible personal hygiene. My teeth don't hurt and aren't actively falling out or anything but I'm positive there's stuff wrong and the longer I'm taking to deal with it the worse it's going to get, and I'm afraid waiting 6+ months for an appointment will result in me needing a root canal or something else crazy expensive that I can't afford. I don't know what I'm supposed to do at this point. Why does this country treat teeth like luxury bones?! I can get care for every other part of my body for free with my insurance but my teeth can just rot and fall out I guess. I'm terrified that in 10 years I'll be wearing dentures.",Anxiety

We agreed to meet up aroud 9pm since he's a kind of night owl while im a morning person. I arrive around 8:50pm he wasn't there. I send him a text but still no response. Then after an hour he informs me he's drinking with friends at a bar and he was invited last minute. 

Me, being the passive and spineless person that I am, apologized. I said it was my fault and that me asking him to meet up only a day before was pretty last minute and inconsiderate. I apologized and told him to enjoy himself.

"Iâ€™m 23 and live on my own. I bought a condo last year and was at a job where I was making enough to do it all. It was a good job and I was working my way up. But slowly it started to get to me. Around this time last year I started to throw up before work and started to feel overwhelmingly anxious. I started to call out more which looked bad because I was trying to be a manager but I literally couldnâ€™t get my self out of the house with out throwing up and having a panic attack. I finally left that job because I couldnâ€™t handle it anymore and thought if I find something simple it will be better for me. So I got a job as a front desk person it was fine. It was for a family owned business so it was very relax except for the fact that they kinda wanted a lot more out of me. Then the anxiety came up again and I started to throw up. So I left to find something else. Worked at a grocery store and it was fine for the first week or two and then it came back again. At this point I decided to take time off from work because I had the savings to do so. I was happy when I was off I wasnâ€™t throwing up unless I put my self in a anxious situation. But my savings were running low and I have bills to pay for so I looked back for work. I thought a stay at home job might help me. So I got one in something I already have some experience in. I thought it was going to be easy but it seems to be one of the most stressful jobs. I know I can do it but it becomes too much for me. I started to throw up again I thought I was in the clear. For the weeks of training I was fine until I had to go on phones. My anxiety makes me avoid confrontation and thatâ€™s all this job is basically. Customers calling in mad and me trying to make it right. I feel so defeated I donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t keep running away but I feel cornered. I thought I could do this, be an adult and do things on my own. But itâ€™s hard. No matter what I got to show I still feel like Iâ€™m 5 who can express their emotions but instead cries and vomits.

"I used to get out the house so much before the panic attacks struck, but since my anxiety has started again ive been so hesistant to leave the house, i can go to my lessons and local shops, but anything further then that i just cant manage. 

The first time i had a panic attack i was in a city and it was horrible because i was so far away from home, i think this has caused the anxiety over leaving the house. I think its just the fear of leaving that safe space and having that potential of having another panic attack in public. Really gives me alot of dread the thought of going to a city.

When i try go for walk, i get really wobbly and it feels like im gonna collapse, because of this i prefer to cycle to places rather then walking.

Its so stupid, cause since those panic attacks i have really pushed myself and been to Concerts, night clubs and pubs and had no problems at all, but i cant focus on those positives i just focus on the few bad experiences ive had.

Its just really messing up my life, i used to love going to cities, meeting friends and stuff, but now i get nervous over going to a local corner shop. So anyone else feel like this or been through it, if so how did you manage it?",Anxiety
"I think one of the most annoying things about anxiety is that it makes you feel off almost everyday.

I either have a headache, stomachache, dizziness or sore eyes or a mixture of these basically all the time and itâ€™s just so annoying. Once one thing fades away something else will come in to take its place.

I know I could improve my general health by eating better and not being so sedentary but itâ€™s like a vicious cycle because when youâ€™re feeling sick or anxious the last thing you want to do is exercise. Most of the time you donâ€™t even feel capable of doing that.

Sadly that problem came in when I talked to my other real life friend and some girl I've met through insta and they both think that my friend was either playing a prank and that girl doesn't even exist and that worries me because if that's the truth my next year will start by me losing a friend and having no dates to go to.

Like this date was supposed to be the first step for me to open up more and become more social with people and if I don't have a date then where can I go to?

Germany is probably gonna go on a heavy lockdown so I will isolate even more than before.

Like I've asked him since the start of December to give me her insta so I can contact her more since I know my friend is a busy person and he still hasnt gave me any way to contact her.

Its been almost 2 months since he told me there was a girl who was interested in me and almost 2 later I still have no contacts with her and i still don't know if I ever will go on this date.

Tommorow really is the judgement day tbh.

I'm feeling so anxious because I've been preparing for this date for two months and realizing that it may not happen makes me so anxious because this was my biggest plan of this holidays how I'm gonna go on my first ever date with someone and I'm finally gonna open up as a person and gain new experience it just seems like this isn't going to happen and I'm just gonna start this next year again alone just going nowhere probably gonna have fucking online classes that will make me more isolated.

It is not just about the school, i overthink every possible thing, even if everything is ""ok"". I am scared of the future. I am scared of people. I am scared of everything in this world. I am too sensitive. this is a lot more complicated. 

i am only here for my loved ones. I find comfort when thinking about ending it all. Im not even scared of death, ever since i started reading/watching science stuff i feel like there is nothing to be afraid of and it is going to happen one day anyway. (not planning, but the thoughts are eating me)

I want to live and i am grateful for a lot of things, but at the same time I do not have the will and strength to go through this hell anymore. I dont even know what to do with my life. I keep putting everything away. I always end up in the same place mentally. 
anxiety is killing me since forever.
I really want to see a therapist/psychiatrist again, but i dont have the strength to explain it all plus i dont even know how!!!!!! thank you for reading. wanted to get it off my chest...",Anxiety
"Iâ€™m a 29 year old male and currently active duty military. I say that to preface that while Iâ€™m not in amazing shape, we are held to a physical standard and most of us are moderately healthy people. 

Over the last couple years various issues have brought me into medical. Most recently it was a breathing issue and chest pain.  At first I assumed I had contracted Covid but was tested immediately and it was negative. I then had and EKG ran and everything was deemed normal. The doc listened to my lungs and said things were fine. After doing a physical exam and finding the source of the pain, the doctor diagnosed me with costochondritis or inflammation of the cartilage that connects the rib cage and sternum. 
The relief of knowing my chest pain was neither lung or heart related lasted a few hours. Ever since then I am reminded almost every breath I take that something isnâ€™t right. It just simply doesnâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m able to get enough air into my lungs and when I focus on this, it brings me on the verge of panic. 
Iâ€™m not sure what To do.I canâ€™t tell if my breathing issue is simply the costochondritis mixed with physical symptoms of my anxiety or what but it seems like even when I search for the answers by going in for an exam, Iâ€™m left with more questions because I canâ€™t take the docs word for it.",Anxiety

I didn't find that out about the movies until after I was already around people.  I am scared.  My immune system will not protect me I do not make antibodies.  I did not get tested.

Hi guys what are some good jobs for people who suffer from severe social anxiety? Looking for something I can do from home as its becoming harder and harder to turn up at my existing job and there's no chance that at this stage in my life I can go undergo a formal job interview.

"Had exercised in the morning.

The neck muscles were stiff.  The body was stiff.

Went for a walk and zure enough was feeling shaky

Managed to finish the walk. At he neck amd jaw muscles were stiff. This was causing a feeling of discomfort and anxiety. 

Just stretched them and did belly breathing.  Remembered some funny video moments . After 30-40 minutes felt a little better.

Dad said take the xanax. Why suffer.  I said let me without it. Did not take it. Went Theodore anxious moments but finally much better. 

Push-ups in the morning probably stiffened my Jaw and neck. Have narrow airways. Probably one of the reasons.
Will stretch everything after workout next time. Also will reduce the intensity. 

Cannot find hot pad. Dad buying new one.

Hope it helps.  Thank you for reading

"A few months ago, I noticed every time I brushed my hair I was shedding a lot. Showering became a source of stress, because I didn't want to see all the hair I was losing. I have a lot of anxiety around my appearance, but my hair has always been something I felt ok about. 

I started stressing more. Maybe it was stress making my hair fall out, but what if it was something worse? What if there was a medical reason? Or maybe my hair was just thinning because I'm aging (33/F). I bought expensive hair vitamins and started taking them. I stopped brushing my hair as much so I wouldn't have to see it. 

And then, the week before Christmas, I realized I hadn't had a haircut in months. I cut six inches off my ends (my hair was almost long enough to sit on) and like magic, my hair stopped falling out. What was happening was my dead ends were tangling and ripping healthy hair out when I brushed. Normally shed hair wasn't falling away, it was getting stuck and only coming loose in the shower or when brushing. 

Since I cut off all my ends, my shedding has returned to the normal amount, my hair isn't getting nearly as tangled, and I can finally relax that I won't be bald coming into my 34th year.",Anxiety

"*potential TW: very brief mention of self harm* 
TL;DR at the end :)

A lot of the time I (17F) wish I had some major trauma or awful thing happen to me to justify and explain why Iâ€™m always so sad and self-loathing, so that Iâ€™ll feel like I deserve help. Because a lot of the time I just feel like a horrible, narcissistic bitch for wishing it.

I mean, I have what Iâ€™d call extremely minor â€œtraumaâ€ from all my friends abandoning me for other people at numerous points throughout my teens (which caused social anxiety, panic attacks and self-hatred to the point of self harm), but I never feel like it justifies why I feel the way I do- I can just snap out of it, so why donâ€™t I?

Itâ€™s actually pathetic- because I have a great family, a nice house, a lot of material things. We go on foreign holidays and I do feel very lucky to have what I have. I always go to great pains to show how grateful I am. But I feel incredibly guilty, because I know I donâ€™t deserve it. Sometimes I wish I could be good at something instead, but Iâ€™m literally not good at anything I do. 

Hereâ€™s a little story: my younger brother, R,  was around 9 or 10 when he got his ASD diagnosis, and obviously my parents always had to go to meetings and things with him. As a result, me and my twin brother, D, felt pretty abandoned for a few years while this was all going on. We were 11 or 12, so it shouldnâ€™t have been a big deal for us. Now that weâ€™re all older and the attention is off R for the most part, my parents have finally noticed that Iâ€™m probably on the spectrum too, so they want to get me diagnosed for it. I feel like itâ€™s too late.

I mention that story only because I donâ€™t know if it may have anything to do with why I feel the way I do? 

I know, I know. This reeks of self-pity. Iâ€™m sorry. I donâ€™t know how else to express itâ€¦ Itâ€™s way too long, but I had to tell someone. I canâ€™t get therapy. Thank you for reading until the end. 

TL;DR: I hate myself for wanting trauma to validate my pain and I donâ€™t entirely know why. I wish I could stop feeling like this.",Anxiety

"I have OCD and generalized anxiety. Itâ€™s usually pretty well managed.

This past week, Iâ€™ve gotten it into my head that my oldest son has autism. There were a few signs that I saw and now Iâ€™m focusing on every tiny little thing heâ€™s doing and panicking over it. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s real or not and I canâ€™t get him to see a specialist for a couple of months because the wait lists are so long. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m thinking rationally and thereâ€™s really a problem, or if my anxiety has gotten the better of me.

But the bigger problem right now is my anxiety. All I can think about is my son. Two days ago I woke up panicking because I had a dream where I was in a school for kids with severe autism. My heart is racing constantly, Iâ€™m shaking and sweating. I canâ€™t sleep. I havenâ€™t been able to eat for about a week now and Iâ€™ve lost over ten pounds. I canâ€™t think about anything else. I canâ€™t function. Iâ€™m forgetting things.

All I want right now is to send my kids away, lay in bed and pretend the world doesnâ€™t exist, but I canâ€™t do that.

Iâ€™m seeing my doctor today and hoping he can prescribe me something to help. I havenâ€™t seen my therapist in a couple years but I called her and havenâ€™t heard back.

"Yesterday I needed to get a blood test done at a clinic in my neighborhood where you just show up and get seen on a first come first served basis, so I walked up, saw a queue with about four people and stood behind the last one. Now I'm naturally a very distracted person so after this I just followed the steps of whoever was ahead of me while looking down at my phone. A solid five min later a woman angrily says loudly: EXCUSE ME BUT THE END OF THE LINE IS BACK THERE!
I was honestly stumped and wasn't really sure what she meant so I just managed to mumble ""I don't understand..."" And she repeated ""THE END OF THE LINE IS THAT WAY, I WAS HERE WAY BEFORE YOU YOU NEED TO BE BEHIND US."" To which a man standing next to her added ""Yeah I was here too"" or something along those lines.

I felt mortified and confused so I started walking towards the very end of the line walking past all these people I supposedly cut in front of but had actually never seen in my life. The man at the end of the line said: ""oh no no you're ahead of me :) I just got here"" so I thanked him and said "" oh, thanks yeah those people are angry at me but I honestly didn't see anyone so thanks for telling me"". 

To which the woman said again ""YOU DIDNT SEE ME?REALLY???""
I said ""No...""

I managed to stay in the queue but it was very difficult as I silently burst into tears, thankfully with the covid mask and my glasses it hopefully wasn't very noticeable and I managed to regain composure before it was my turn.

Now I can't stop punishing myself for not having come up with a clever answer or telling her to fuck off or something. I keep replaying it in my mind and I honestly just want to let it go but I can't.

"I feel like as I get older, my anxiety manifests in different ways.

When I was younger (in my early to late teens) leaving the house was a struggle as I felt like everyone was staring at me, I constantly felt â€˜exposedâ€™ wherever I went. I would wear long sleeves and pants everyday, you would never catch me on a singlet or t-shirt, or shorts.

Now that Iâ€™m older (27F) I have overcome that quite a bit, but Iâ€™ve started developing phobias and I guess dark/scary thoughts about things I had never considered.

My two examples are:
- Fear of flying: I have solo travelled the world and flown more than 40 times on some VERY dodgy airlines (from my backpacker days), and have never been a nervous flyer. But earlier this year I went on a 1 hour domestic flight and had a full-blown panic attack mid-air. I started crying and everything, convinced that we were going down. And the same thing happened on the flight back, I couldnâ€™t rationalise it.

- Looking at the stars: I used to absolutely love star-gazing and would seek to look at a clear night sky. Now whenever I see lots of stars on a clear night my mind goes straight to â€œwhat if I just saw a huge meteor coming towards earth that was going to kill us allâ€, and I canâ€™t help but feel sick about how scary space is. I have even had reoccurring nightmares about meteors crashing into the earth/knowing weâ€™re all going to die.

"Iâ€™m a 32 year old female with a stable job and great marriage. We have no kids, just a dog.

Over the past month, Iâ€™ve started having trouble staying asleep and wake up around 3-4 almost every morning worrying about something and have a hard time going back to sleep. My thoughts have also started turning more dark. For example, my husband noted thereâ€™s a chance we could move to Hawaii for work (we move states very often so this is normal).

"Hey guys. I don't know if this is the right subreddit, but my problem has to do with mental health and anxiety, so i guess i can get away with it.

So, here's the deal: I'm M20 and currently live at my parents. I am studying sociology in the first semester.
I need time to get used to the whole study thing again, since it's been a while since i left school. It's really hard to focus on anything but that's not the problem. 

What bugs me is, that my mum does not see the effort I'm giving. For all i know she thinks i don't do anything. (she told me several times) I'm not exaggerating when i say she DAILY tells me i need to get a job. Which i understand. I need to save money, gain experience, become my own human being and all of that. That's perfectly clear to me, but after 5 years of working experience i still can't wrap my mind around the concept of working. 
I have the problem that i never made it through a job more than two months. I don't have a problem working and I am for sure not a lazy person, but i always have a problem going into something new, knowing, that company owns me now. I can't stand the fact that i have duties to somebody else than myself.

This has led to me making up excuses to quit jobs. Quitting a job has always been the most positive feeling i felt. It's always been a rush of excitement, a feeling of freedom, even being newborn. It really shouldn't be like that, should it? 
I'm about to do the same right now. I have an Interview today for a job i already did this summer. It was not bad working there, i had time to study while doing it, so it was perfect. But something in me shouts at me that i can't go back in there. It feels like running in circles while ripping out my own soul. i really can't explain it.

Yes, i have talked about this with my therapist, but we're only a few sessions in so he hasn't really given me any advice yet. So I'm asking you guys. What can i do to change my mindset about being in an employment relationship?

"I had severe anxiety every morning for 5 months(march to july) because i was waiting for something(personal). At August I had seizure since then I've been feeling constant dizziness panic attacks and too many negative thoughts. I'm not afraid of getting seizure again instead I would be happy.

"Hello all. Iâ€™m not sure if panic attacks are anything genetically affected but both my parents suffer from frequent panic attacks and they went to the hospital a lot and got medication. I too got prescribed xanax but I only use that when I start shaking. I get a lot of panic attacks, mostly at night when going to bed. When I hear a slight noise and have difficulty going to sleep, my head stresses and then starts shaking with anger and annoyance. 
My panic attacks are usually breathing related and just kind of a scared state of mind. I have shortness of breath and I have to keep breathing in heavily and I feel like I am not getting enough air. Pretty much like working out to your climax not being able to breathe in all the day so it feels like you are suffocating. I have never met anyone with panic disorders have the same symptoms as me. 
The reason why I am writing this is because I do not want panic attacks or anxiety my whole life almost everyday. I want to enjoy my teenage years and the rest of my life without panic attacks or so much stress. Although xanax does help calm me, i donâ€™t want to rely on it and I was wondering for a solution.

This anxiety attack proves it, what should my next steps be? This night has been the absolute worst and I cannot slip back into my terrible anxiety, Iâ€™m not sure if I could handle it again. Please help",Anxiety
"I'm not talking about a full-blown panic attack but rather about that constant, nagging anxiety that follows you around all day and distracts you from thinking straight.

I find it hard to do something that has no apparent 'purpose' when I'm really anxious, so I often busy myself with housework (laundry, cleaning etc).

When the anxiety is a bit lower, I like to knit, colour or do paper-crafts. 

Today I'm really anxious because I have a rather difficult conversation scheduled in the evening, so I'm looking forward to your tips :)",Anxiety

Most good things in my life are now gone and I canâ€™t even act like a normal person anymore, it feels like Iâ€™m an alien, especially with how severe my anxiety has gotten.

"I(19F) have had serious trauma from childhood that has made me develop complex PTSD. I have bad anxiety and depression that debilitates my personal life and my relationships with other people.  Iâ€™ve always been someone who needs extra reassurance, because I get in my own head very easily and I feel like my brain is constantly looking for anything thatâ€™s â€œoffâ€. I know this can get really annoying and frustrating for the people I am around, so I have been trying my best to work on it. I also consider myself a really deep empath, and all of my emotions hit me very hard. When I really care about someone I will put a lot of energy into them, and really try to show I care. I always try to help people in my life the best I can. (I am a type 2 on the enneagram test if that helps). Iâ€™ve never really been able to find someone whoâ€™s given the same energy I do, and i think i always end up pushing them away. I get a lot of intrusive thoughts, where Iâ€™ll get so angry or sad to the point where I imagine myself doing violent acts (mostly like destroying stuff or punching holes in the wall and i am definitely not strong enough for that lmao). Iâ€™ve been to therapy, taken medication, written down all my thoughts etc. Honestly I feel like sometimes Iâ€™ll never be able to change who I am and I feel guilty about that. But I just wish I was able to find someone who understand the way I am. Honestly sometimes I just feel fucking crazy because my mind just canâ€™t let things go.",Anxiety
"I spend most of my time in my bedroom, itâ€™s where Iâ€™m most comfortable. But sometimes I get a really heavy feeling of being extremely uncomfortable.

But it feels too small and it just doesnâ€™t feel like my room, I feel like Iâ€™m at a strangers house. I felt very heavy like my body was heavy and it was like I was breathing with someone sitting on top of my chest. This happens sometimes, but not much recently and I guess I just am finally ready to figure out why this happens. Does anyone relate, or if it isnâ€™t anxiety does anyone know what it could be?

"I have recently noticed that one of my coping mechanisms for my anxiety is googling the issue and looking at every single possible outcome. For example, I am calling out of work tomorrow and that makes me quite anxious. I have spent the last 45 minutes scrolling through my jobs subreddit reading every single post about calling out, sick time, etcâ€¦ i honestly feel embarrassed I spent that much time doing it. I do the same thing when any issue that causes me significant anxiety comes up. I immediately google the issue and read just about every webpage on the internet about it. Itâ€™s definitely obsessive, not just like a quick google search. Sometimes Iâ€™ll scroll through the pages for days before the event thatâ€™s making me anxious.

It doesnt happen around people im comfortable with and it never happens when I'm just talking to myself or my cat but I find it always happens whenever I'm immensely anxious and scared. Which makes it all worse as well bc I'm already anxious af and now my throat is giving up on me too.

My sex drive has been off since my last relationship, which was abusive, causing anxiety around sex and intimacy. 

I met someone with the intention of being friends, turns out we matched really well and most of it has been amazing.

Iâ€™ve explained my erratic sex drive, my anxiety around intimacy (Iâ€™ve lost all confidence and get turned off when things get intense) - heâ€™s fine with being patient and waiting.

Iâ€™m having really really bad anxiety about all of this. Iâ€™ve already told him multiple times that this wonâ€™t work, Iâ€™m not ready, Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll fuck up the relationship. I feel like I need to break it off before I fuck it up moreâ€¦.which, in turn, makes me think my anxiety is incorrectly telling me to do.

fast forward later, i noticed how my regular heartbeats were faster. i brushed it off at first, but now everything tips me off and makes me anxious and panic; right now iâ€™m sitting on my parents bed after iâ€™d waken them up in the middle of the night because of how terrible it was. for some reason, this has also made my fear of throwing up even worse, so whenever i feel my stomach make the slightest complaint, i panic, making the nausea worse, then i panic some more. itâ€™s a never-ending cycle. suffice to say, i wasnâ€™t like this before.

Ok there is this guy that messaged me saying that conversation is his thing and that I'm adorable. I knew him from a while back, I used to work with him he was my manager.

"1) When I look up the DSM-V for any anxiety disorder eveyrthing just matches up and applies to me.

2) I've been asthmatic/had respiratory problems since birth but suspiciously enough my 'asthma attacks' only came around when I was in a very anxious situation (eg. Teeth clattering, entire body trembling, heart racing, hyperventilating, weakness throughout my entire body, feeling imbalanced and dizzy, all because I met up with some friends for the first time in a while. Also, even though my inhaler helped nowdays I wonder if it was just a placebo effect and it simply was like a comfort device in those situations.

3) Isubconsciously take so many precautions for so many highly improbable situations either because I experienced it once or heard of someone else's experience (eg. I don't walk closeby to cars cause I'm afraid someone is going to slash a tendon in my foot and leave me unable to escape, being unable to even look out of windows at night cause I'm afraid that someone is going to notice me and either shoot at me or come inside and rob the house). Sometimes I might even 

4) I am so unbelievably jumpy and it's overbearing. I've reached the point where my body is just so stressed out and worn out from reacting to every little environmental disturbance. Every morning my body just doesn't want to respond and get up out of bed. For example today when just a drop of water touched my shoulder from an AC and I immediately jumped and stepped back, or just 5 minutes before then when I got startled after noticing the tip of the shadow of a door move. It's reached to the point where sometimes I'm numbed to the feeling aspect of it so my body jumps but I have the straightest face or just carry on whatever I was doing before.

5) I do have phobias, for example my fear of caterpillars and insect larvae. I can recall earlier this year when I stepped on a caterpillar barefooted and immediately went into a fight or flight state of mind. And just remembering and recalling the situation makes me get body shivers.

6) The anxiousness I get in social situations is unbearable, especially in public. It's subconscious at this point so I can't really describe my usual actions but in a public situation I feel as though I'm in the 3rd person (I don't physically see myself in that view then though) and all I can think about is how weird I'm standing (I'm bowlegged and my parents do complain about how I stand regularly), or if my hair is looking proper, or if my back is straight. It's taken a very huge toll on my self confidence and has led to (with assistance from other issues) suicidal thoughts on so many occasions.

7) The overthinking which I've already dived into (essentially all of the points) has come in other ways. For example I have spent months just bringing up the courage to come on this/any other mental health related subreddit to vent about this on the basis that: my friends might find the post and either through shade at me about it or over sympathisr with me and make me regret this; get shamed on the internet for self-diagnosing and ending up getting dragged somewhere after being doxxed or whatever. And for EVERY. SIMPLE. ONE THOUGHT NECESSARY. TASK that I have to perform my head genuinely goes through one HUGE debate in the course of a few milliseconds. To sum the debates up: I think of a few reasons why I should do a instead of b and then think of eveyrthing that could do wrong if I do a, and then countermeasures to what could go wrong with doing a, then what could go wrong with those countermeasures and that goes over and over until I just answer ""I don't know"". It's cause stuff like emotional ambivalence which is very stressful cause I end up bringing down myself for not being able to just answer a simple question like ""how are you?""

8) A mixture of memory loss and a LOT of self doubt. I genuinely do forget a lot of things like a simple task that I heard just a few seconds ago, but sometimes my brain just goes through a bunch of thinking and I end up making myself think I'm wrong. Its gotten to the stage where sometimes I have to reassure myself of my name and DOB and other personal info.

I feel as though it would've been passed down genetically as well as through conditioning as i basically experienced a cliche ""gifted child peaks in 3rd grade and wastes all potential from then on"". That as well as things that my parents have told me (my dad's constant nagging about every single mistake, as well as my mother saying that I was the reason for an argument between her and my dad).

Also too, based on how my parents and brother behave, and stories from my parents about their parents and siblings, my family has a history of mental illness and honestly I wouldn't be surprised if I got it from my dad based on how he behaves a lot.

In terms of reaching out for help with my issues, I've vented to my friends about it and honestly their help means the absolute world to me and I love them for it. But for some reason it just doesn't have an effect on me. Like there's a gigantic mental block thats just stopping any verbal and unprofessional help from working. I'm thinking that if I were to talk to a psych another placebo effect might occur and it will work???? Idk I'm unsure.

I've asked my parents to take me to a psychologist and my mom initially agreed and made plans but never followed up on them. And my dad believes that I'm completely sane and normal and just need to be more diligent/ that it's a character problem, not mental. His main argument is that he survived it and thus so can I

"You can't avoid the pain. You can't avoid the resistance. You can't avoid the will to live. Go fucking with it. It's impossible to resist what is. Until the end, it will be what it is. You have no control. Relinquish your futile efforts in resistance and avoidance and embrace the strength of letting go. There will be pain, there will be suffering and that's just the way it is. We all will go through it, the question is, how well will you go through it? Babies have died minutes after being born, children have died horrific and painful deaths and adults as well - there is no escaping pain and suffering, we're all put through the test. Whether you die young or old, the present moment is all we lose. Memories will be just a grain of dust at that point and hopes for the future will be almost laughable.

Even when I do hide in my room Iâ€™m fighting the urge to jump out of bed because I feel like there are important things Iâ€™m forgetting to do but I donâ€™t know what they are. I just want to disappear but everyone depends on me. How do I cope?",Anxiety
"I'm 26 now and I used to just be emotionless to fight anxiety. But now that I want to change and be more authentic and nurturing my own emotions I find myself being too open about my anxiety to people I want to get close to, like asking them if they are only interested in something else rather than being genuinely interested in me.

And I hate it, I really don't want to keep acting like this. 

Anyone can please teach me a strategy to not blurt out stupid things to other people? 

I know the question is a bit silly and that I should just shut up, but Idk I feel like the doubt literally eats me in the moment.",Anxiety
"I had to get an MRI on my neck and shoulders to check into some suspected nerve damage. I was not at all prepared for what was ahead. When I arrived they told me Iâ€™d be in the tube for TWO hours. I thought they were joking and when I realized they were serious I started getting anxious. I asked to take my anxiety med, they agreed. They tried to put me in the tube for a test drive to see what it was like, and I immediate freaked and told them to take me out. Then we waited a few minutes for me to calm down. By this time I was shaking and my heart was racing. After a few deep breaths, I agreed to start the process. Then they stabilized my neck and put a contraption over my head and chin so I couldnâ€™t move. Like at all. And I immediately started to panic. Then they started to move the table into the tube and I couldnâ€™t take it anymore. I immediately started shouting â€œIâ€™m so scared! Please! Iâ€™m not ready! Wait! Wait! Wait!â€ And started bawling.

At that point, we all agreed that it wasnâ€™t happening for me today. They said Iâ€™ll need stronger meds. But I have zero plans to return at all. I canâ€™t do it. I canâ€™t even imagine doing it without getting upset.

Iâ€™m just venting because I feel so disappointed in myself for failing. For insurance purposes, the best time for me to get this MRI was today (deductibles and all that). Now Iâ€™ll have to pay more. And now Iâ€™ll have to convince my doctor to consider other methods to treat me. Iâ€™m so frustrated with myself.",Anxiety
"I've had anxiety on and off for over ten years now. I know first-hand that it can cause muscle tension in the neck and shoulders, but in the past it's always been fairly low-intensity, a lasting soreness that makes my day more uncomfortable but not acutely stressful.

But for a couple weeks now I've been having actual cramps/spasms on the left side of my neck. Real painful, too, like someone's kicked my neck with a steel-toed boot. They're impossible to ignore or just 'power through'. The only thing that helps is taking some painkillers and resting in bed for a couple hours. Sometimes after I feel better I try to go about my normal activities only for it to happen again! 

Apart from the pain I have no other symptoms. Has anyone experienced anything similar? Can anxiety do this, or do I most likely have some other problem? Thanks.",Anxiety

Surprisingly, I do feel an effect from them, though itâ€™s not always necessarily good. For instance, I took two a little bit ago and this time I feel kinda foggy, almost like I took a hit of a weak joint. Itâ€™s making my anxiety worse, but I think itâ€™s because of the sensation, if that makes sense. Iâ€™m going to try to meditate and see if it goes away.",Anxiety
"So I get anxiety often (almost everyday at this point) whether severe or mild but what Iâ€™ve noticed is that Iâ€™m beginning to experience physical symptoms.

For example I get heart palpitations which is one of the most common physical symptoms but my main worry is the occasional breathing difficulty episode.

Iâ€™m unsure whether I have something wrong with my lungs like asthma or something else but most people Iâ€™ve talked to about it say itâ€™s my anxiety and Iâ€™m fine.

However sometimes itâ€™s so bad Iâ€™m literally on the verge of dropping to the floor or fainting which also happened today where I felt as though I couldnâ€™t breathe properly and it also didnâ€™t feel like an anxiety attack because I wasnâ€™t really anxious apart from the fact I felt like I was about to faint.

However, cases are at all time high here like in most placed. When my mom came home, I decided to take my car to go pick up some things via drive up. I hadn't even left my house in over 3 weeks due to my fears of this variant.

Before getting into my car, I left the driver side door open for a bit (maybe 1-2 minutes) to try to let some of the air flow and drove with with the window slightly open to let air circulate. I should've drove for a little bit with all 4 windows down and that would have made me feel a lot better.

"Hey, guys I just discovered this subreddit, I've been dealing with anxiety for a little bit now I think a few years. I am also diagnosed with ADHD&gt; I have a girlfriend and a lot of friends that all love me however I often deal with intrusive thoughts about how they're just using me, they're gonna leave me, etc with no real basis other than my brain telling me that's how it is. It's really affecting a lot of what I enjoy doing and my personal relationships. They normally start small and then progress over the course of a few days or weeks until I have a massive blowup/panic attack.

"**\*TRIGGER WARNING\***Trying to keep this rant as short as possible, here we go. I am 16 years old and got diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder last year. I was in a toxic relationship at the time, and my ex-girlfriend completely deterred me from medication, and I honestly don't want to be on an SSRI for my own personal reasons. Anywho, the mental turmoil from the breakup of said toxic relationship sent me into a stage earlier this year that was something like I've never seen before. I've never considered myself exceptionally sociable, but after the breakup, I was hanging out with people so much that I was sleeping in my own bed in my own house only a few days per month( I suspect this possibly could've even been a manic episode, even though I'm not diagnosed for bipolar or anything other than GAD). Come August, whenever school started back and reality hit, my happiness has been depleting drastically, and I have done worse in school this year than ever before (I have anxiety about grades, and have always made straight A's. This semester I have 3 B's). There became a point where I had to leave school early because of a panic attack and I told my mom that I thought I needed to be hospitalized. She found a therapist in my town, who I have been talking to and improving upon, going once a week. However, come about a month and a half ago, he has been undergoing heart surgery and I haven't been able to see him for my appointments. I feel so lost, I feel like I'm desperately trying to find happiness and fun in every which way possible and it's not enough for me. I had an amazing Christmas and got a ton of gifts, I have a new girlfriend who is amazing, yet I still question whether or not I even want to be with her, even though nothing has gone wrong to make me think such things. Whenever I first got diagnosed with GAD, I was pretty overweight- weighing in at 194 lbs at 5'8"". I went on a ketogenic diet, and for those unaware, it brings psychological changes along with weight loss. It is proven that the ketogenic diet lowers the overall presence of serotonin in the brain, yet increases the overall presence of dopamine, which also confuses me because SSRIS impacts the serotonin receptors (I'm by no means a psychologist, that's just my mental handle on it.) I plan to start the ketogenic diet again around New Year's to see if it improves my mental state, but of course, I'm worrying that it will not. **TLDR**: I feel like something is wrong with me, chemically in my brain, whether anxiety or something else as well, and I feel mentally and psychologically lost and drained and need advice.",Anxiety

"I have a diagnosis of anxiety, but it was left untreated until summer 2020 when my GP put me on antidepressants due to my panic attacks. This helped for a while but the last few months have been really hard.
I have several physical health conditions and they got a but worse and then my anxiety got worse which made it difficult for me to do my university work and I fell really behind. I thought over Christmas I would get a bit better and be able to catch up as I'm staying with my partner and last time I stayed with them i was able to be really productive with their encouragement, but this hasn't happened this time. My physical health actually got worse and I started having full body spasms and my anxiety has just spiraled. 
The stupid thing is I know it's ironic. Being behind in uni work makes me anxious but my anxiety stops me being able to work which puts me more behind which makes me more anxious. If I just stopped being anxious I could catch up but I just can't and it makes me feel depressed and stressed and my mental health getting worse also makes my physical health worse so it's all just one awful depressing cycle.

I have struggled with anxiety for my entire life, and I finally feel like I'm able to freely talk about it. And now I have an amazing girlfriend who loves and supports me. The only problem is, my anxiety makes me constantly worry about her safety and well being and also worry that she's about to break up with me.  
Today it sadly reached a bit of a boiling point, but there's also a happy ending to it all.  
I was hanging out with one of my friends and the cloudy weather outside was making my anxiety a lot worse. I decided to call my girlfriend to check up on her because, that usually makes it go away for a while. But she didn't answer, so I called her again, and then again, and then a third time. And then I started panicking because I thought she was going to get mad at me for spamming her and break up with me. So I texted her, and apologized for spamming her. She didn't respond for an hour which caused everything to bubble up and I couldn't talk about it because I was still with my friend. I then started freaking out because i thought the texts i sent would make her more angry because I was only spamming her more. And I can't delete the texts which only made me worry more. But after an hour, she texted me and told me that she didn't even get notifications for the calls and even if she did she wouldn't get mad at me for it. ANd I finally started to feel better.

"so I just joined this community hoping I could talk about this here, and that it might the the best place for it, but

iâ€™m currently a junior in college. I just came from a community college to a 4 year and I have realized that while iâ€™m at school and even when iâ€™m home and thinking about being at school I get such intense anxiety. mainly iâ€™m worried because I donâ€™t have any friends so I spend most of my time sitting alone or doing homework; it gives me so much anxiety because I feel like everyone else has friends and are making memories and iâ€™m wasting the best time of my life. 

I donâ€™t like doing nothing when iâ€™m at school because I just feel like iâ€™m wasting time and iâ€™m going to regret not doing anything in college; but hereâ€™s the thing, I donâ€™t like parties. I donâ€™t like drinking. I donâ€™t like socializing with a lot of people. I put myself out there and do fun things but I much rather would have 1-2 close friends who I could hang out with but I havenâ€™t been able to find them yet. so right now anytime iâ€™m at school and trying to relax I feel such guilt and anxiety and that I should be doing something or socializing. 

I just was curious if anyone else has this anxiety brought on by school. less grade motivated and more socially motivated. I just get worried that iâ€™m wasting my years doing nothing while literally everyone else has great friends that they spend so much time with and they enjoy it. I even enjoy some alone time, I used to thrive on it until I went through a breakup and that all kind of switched. iâ€™m getting better at being alone now and iâ€™ve picked up new hobbies that make me enjoy me time but sometimes the anxiety just still crosses my mind.",Anxiety

"So Iâ€™m prone to panic attacks and have lived with anxiety my entire life, and theyâ€™ve gotten ten times worse in the past two years since the pandemic started. Covid freaks me out and every time I think I have symptoms of it, I get irrational thoughts and start to panic and think Iâ€™m going to stop breathing or need to go to the hospital or something. 

I bought a finger pulse oximeter at Walmart yesterday that tells you your heart rate and oxygen saturation. Every time I start to have these thoughts or the anxiety starts building, I put it on my finger and within seconds the reading pops up and is always in the completely normal range, and it instantly stops my anxiety because it reminds me that Iâ€™m ok and that my heart and lungs are working just fine.

"So I had an ""episode"" last night. I can't even call them attacks anymore because I'm totally calm through them. I'm curious though because a panic/anxiety attack is supposed to last like 15 minutes. Mine last all night and come in waves. I'm guessing that is my body releasing adrenaline over periods of time. I don't react to it emotionally at all anymore but it still happens for many hours (probably 6 - 8 hours). Then I have an adrenaline hangover the next day (today). Does anyone else have ""attacks"" like this? I keep thinking.. maybe these are not panic attacks at all.

If I could ever get my sleep study data back... I would almost guarantee that I have sleep apnea and my body is dumping adrenaline every time I can't breath.  

My Fitbit data looks like little cups in my heart rate... that's me going back to sleep and then waking up with another, smaller (each time) panic attack. They happen almost perfectly timed! It's about every 1.5 hours and then the next wave comes but each time getting smaller.

Am I having panic attacks or is this something else? Don't get me wrong.. I used to go into full panic attack mode when this would happen but after 8 months of therapy, I'm just like ""whatever"" now. I think the adrenaline hangover the next day (today for me) is the worst part honestly.",Anxiety

It's nearly 12 in the night here, and I'm restless and on the verge of tears. Someone I really liked messaged me a few days ago asking when I was free, I said Thursday this week and they said great. Then we didn't discuss it much more as in definite plans, a place, a time etc, and now it's the night before and they messaged me saying they didn't feel well. The rational side of my brain is telling me that it's okay these things happen. But my low self esteem, and severe anxiety is telling me horrid things. They don't want to meet me, they can do better. That I'm not good enough and they're making excuses to avoid me. I hate how my depression and anxiety feast on moments like this, it is exhausting and it just chips away at my already non-existent self esteem.

I think also because of past trauma, the depression and anxiety use it as proof to reinforce the negative thoughts, for example guys treating me badly in the past is how every interaction is going to go. That I'm not worthy of anyone's time. I hate my thoughts, and I hate myself.",Anxiety
" 

I needed somewhere to put my end of the year thoughts. This is probably gonna be fairly long and I am not sure it is gonna make sense, but it just had to get it out before the new year starts soon.

I feel like a nervous wreck at the moment each little noise I hear at night throws me off. I dont even want to think about New Year's Eve and all the fireworks and loud noises I am gonna hear that night. But it is not just noises, it is everything I keep picturing in my head all these bad scenarios that would never play out irl but I cant get them out of my head. I cant stop worrying. And I have reached the point now where I cant enjoy my vacation anymore because I can only think about how I dont want to continue anymore

I dont know what to do. I have never thought of myself being suicidal and I still would like to believe I would never actually do something like that. Itâ€™s just that lately I have been having some of these really bad thoughts and sometimes when I think about telling someone a part of me just thinks it would be easier to just end it rather than talking to someone.

I think my parents have started to notice now finally that I am not good. But I am too embarrassed to tell them what is going on, my dad has struggled with depression so I know that he and my mom wont judge, but I cant help but feel ashamed of what I am feeling.",Anxiety

None of that seems to make much difference. I can't tell if this is an anxiety thing, it probably is? Anxiety makes me feel nauseous sometimes but this is more like having no appetite.

"Today I told my father that I would like him to go to therapy. I asked him if heâ€™d go for me because I was concerned that he wasnâ€™t processing some childhood trauma and stress from his job in a healthy way. Heâ€™s been drinking over three days a week, to extreme drunkenness for years now. Maybe there was a slight break during the early pandemic days but it was little reprieve. I donâ€™t want him to end up with health complications from drinking, but heâ€™s likely doing so much damage Iâ€™d be surprised if there wasnâ€™t already any issue. When heâ€™s drunk heâ€™s lovely and fun, so heâ€™s not causing me any distress emotionally there but Iâ€™m just worried about his health. And his mental health.
So today I kinda blindsighted him because I was so anxious about the conversation. I asked him if he had a minute and I told him Iâ€™d like for him to go to therapy. I told him I was concerned about his health and I think he should see a professional. He got a little defensive saying he was a happy person and he feels heâ€™s well adjusted. But he often has panic attacks to the point where he canâ€™t drive and heâ€™s drinking himself
Sick. Iâ€™m so worried. I just want him to have some relief from a professional, but I donâ€™t know if heâ€™s mad at me now for bringing it up. We have a great relationship but Iâ€™m

If an online course was available for you to learn different things such as some science behind it, identifying triggers, coping skills, journaling prompts, worksheets, etc.  It obviously would not be intended to replace therapy/medication but instead to work on some self development things in regard to your own person mental health.

We have bene talking through his struggles, and everything was going really well for us in terms of our relationship. He, however is not doing well. When he gets down like this, he gets into the mindset that he needs to be alone to be sad, and will Come close to breaking up with me. And then yesterday, he did that.

"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting on this sub. I just wanna vent and let go of my thoughts.
In the recent time, I was starting to be aware that I might have anxiety related problems. I will give you an example. When I was younger, I used to look at my loved ones from a different point of view. I felt like they will be with me forever. However, in the recent time, when I think of my grandparents, I can't stop thinking what would happen if they are not with me anymore. And You might say thats normal but it changes my view completely since most of the time Im with them I think as if they might not be here the next day and thoughts like this become obssesive. Aside from this, I feel like I get obssesive thoughts when I do something I really care about (I play tennis on high level) so my brain makes me do ""dumb"" stuff (compulsions). For Example, I count... A lot... Im counting my steps, my sips of water, breaths...
But the thing is, I dont have these type of thoughts throughout my day but when I do something I really care about, which brings stress as well (a tournament) these thoughts start to mess with me.
What do you guys think of my situation?

"I know it sounds stupid. Maybe it is. 

But when I was 14/15, I used Twitter as my public diary. I made sure no one I knew in real life could find me, so I used a disposable email and didnâ€™t connect my phone number. I didnâ€™t want to allow anyone the ability to find me through either of those things. But I kept it public so that I could make online friends. I even posted selfies because I knew no one in real life would find me. 

I havenâ€™t used it in years, but I looked through it the other day and itâ€™s just so deeply embarrassing. I tried to log in so that I could deactivate it, but it sent a code to my email that I need in order to get in. The disposable email that no longer exists. 

Iâ€™ve tried contacting Twitter Support but my case has been opened and subsequently closed about six times in the span of 3 days. Iâ€™ve even offered to provide formal ID to confirm the account is mine, but they wonâ€™t even let me speak to a real person. 

Thereâ€™s nothing incriminating or scandalous on there, but I just canâ€™t go through my life knowing that someone could somehow find all of my embarrassing 14 year old thoughts. I just want it gone. Or at least privated.

"TLDR: What do you do when your stress &amp; anxiety is caused by work but changing employers is unlikely to help and changing career or taking time off isn't an option.

Lockdown has been a real eye opener for me, when people started talking about how they were suffering with their mental health I was thinking 'that's me all the time'. Started to realise the way I feel isn't normal and how everyone feels and there's an issue. Numerous online tests all said the same thing, the trio of severe anxiety, severe stress and severe depression. Being in the UK I was able to self refer to NHS mental health services where my scheduled 30 minute assessment ended up taking well over an hour. I've been referred to therapy but unfortunately there's an 8 month minimum wait and I can't afford to go private 

Besides the mental health aspect I've got physical symptoms, a persistent cough, chest pains, sore throat and congestion along with breathlessness which has led to a diagnosis of potential LPR which can be caused by stress &amp; anxiety. And of course with many of those symptoms being common to covid I also have health anxiety. 

While its not the sole problem my work is, I am certain, playing a huge role in my stress and anxiety. To give an example I've been off for the last 5 days and feeling significantly better. Tomorrow I got back to work and my physical symptoms are already getting worse. 

Now the thing I have been told more than once is 'remove the cause' but I can't just stop working. I don't think its particularly the company I currently work for, although there is a couple of things there that don't help, its more the field I work in, other companies I work for have been the same. So the only real option is a career change but that seems impossible without a significant pay cut which just isn't affordable.

I feel like I'm stuck in a situation where I know what a big part of the issue is but have no way of changing it. I'm only in my 40s and counting down the days until I'm eligible for retirement. I can't just write off the next 20+ years of my life.",Anxiety
"Hello, I am 22 and undiagnosed. I recently have gone through a traumatic experience, watching my 9-year-old dog get hit by a car and not being able to get him to the vet before he passed, and then the following day I find out I have lice. LICE... I am VERY compassionate about animals, as well as a fear of any kind of bug, so this is TRAUMATIZING A.T.M... I get these intrusive thoughts of me maybe trying to make myself believe that I could have done something to prevent it, or that it was my fault, or that I reacted in an embarrassing way in front of neighbors as I let out a blood-curdling scream when he got hit.

I did the shampoo treatment for lice, and probably am in the clear. However, I have developed this issue where I cannot even take a shower without overthinking and pushing myself into a panic because I think I have lice ALL over still. I make my girlfriend comb my hair out every time I shower, and she hasn't come across anything at all. My brain just puts me in ""panic"" mode.

I am procrastinating taking a shower and combing my hair RIGHT NOW because I cannot physically get myself to even touch it. My brain just immediately goes ""what happens if you're washing your hair and a bug ends up on you?"" ""what if the movements in your hair are just a bunch of lice? What if you itch it and pull out bugs??"" ""Don't touch it, it's nasty!"" My hands can't physically reach up there without a stomach-dropping feeling.

This is one detailed example of how my brain works through ANY small problem. I will immediately begin overthinking and just freaking myself out. It is honestly so exhausting to deal with this kind of mindset at every MINOR inconvenience. What are some ways I can reduce these intrusive thoughts, and kind of curb the anxious and panicky feelings? Is this even anxiety? Or am I just overthinking this?

"Hello,

I'm writing here because as of lately, I find myself having trouble taking satisfying breaths, but most posts I've seen are of people who cannot for the life of them take deep breaths. However, I guess I'm lucky and I can still take satisfying deep breaths: it feels like a satisfying stretch in my chest and it usually makes my arms tingle, all the way to the tip of my fingers. Sometimes I end up being lightheaded and dizzy afterwards, but not always.

I've had this happen in the past but it would usually only last a few minutes. Now it's been going on for days, I wake up super tired and I need to take a deep breath else I feel like I've been suffocating all night long. Wondering if it has to do with oxygen/co2 in my blood or sleep apnea or something.

It's also winter and the air is kinda dry, my nose sometimes bleeds and gets clogged at night, dry throat and nose, could it also affect it? I've been feeling rather stressed lately for external reasons but I don't know if it's full on anxiety, I've been on Cipralex for my anxiety for 2 years now. I'm super confused and I feel self conscious because I'm always sighing without realizing it, I feel like taking these deep breaths just worsens my problem. I've been looking into the control pause technique, will try it for the following days to see if it helps.

Anyone with something similar, like they can still take a deep breaths but most breaths feel unsatisfying? It feels like I'm going to die or pass out at times... I don't feel particularily anxious, but maybe it's because the state of anxiety is now a norm for me and I don't feel anxious anymore?

"Ive been sick a couple days and got a positive test back this morning, im vaccinated so it's not even the worst sickness I've had.

I don't know where I caught it and I feel like it's my fault if anyone I know gets sick. It doesn't help that I'm stuck with my thoughts quarantining in my room alone right now. I don't know what I need, I just want to stop feeling so anxious about getting other people sick",Anxiety
"The past couple of days that rolled by was pretty tough. Little things get to me which could've been easily let go but I end up letting it get to me that leads into a heavy outburst. 

I even let something that I would see get into my head that's not even about me, but I assumed it did and I blew up about it. Turns out it wasn't me at all but blinded by my trigger and anger I just threw it out there on twitter and reddit. I ended up hurting someone I'm trying to patch the relationship with. 

How could I face someone after that? I could've controlled it, I could've let it go, I went to freaking therapy for the past 5 months and I should've done better. Instead I let these negative thoughts get to my head and I end up fucking things up. I don't know what else I can do to fix things, and I know no matter how many times I apologize, deep down it would never truly fix things, even if I changed. 

How could I say ""I'm doing the best I can"" when I fucked up this hard.

I know to some degree people in general often don't care and they roll things off easily and move on with their life, but I can't. Whenever I messed up in the past I feel so heavy inside, even if things were forgiven that weight is never lifted. Some days its harder to breathe, other days I just feel so tired. No amount of high dosed edibles would be able to relax my body, and sometimes my thoughts would get very powerful and all the terrors of my actions comes out to haunt me. I'm my own prisoner and warden.

All these thoughts, these negative emotions, my brain just replays every screw up I've done. On days when I'm not baked, I know my arm locks up when I'm driving, I'll remember something from a distant past that I've done and it haunts me, the memory stings my head.

Some days I feel like crying forever, I want this pain to kill me, but it seems this isn't enough pain to kill me. Sometimes I wish there was a reset button or some way I can time travel to rewrite my wrongs. Sometimes I wish I could die in some accident, and maybe things would be better for everyone. I'm less of a burden, once I'm gone that black space that exist in other people's heart that I've hurt would be gone and it'd be less of a nuisance.

I'm not looking for some redemption by dying. It's just easier to not cause more pain if I'm already gone",Anxiety

"Hello everyone! I have severe panic attacks and depression the last 2 years but the last months I feel pretty good without panic attacks and that depressed feeling. However the problem is that I have anxiety with all the physical symptoms without panic. My therapist says it is GAD and was underneath panic disorder and depression.
I was really good until I take my COVID vaccine. 12 days ago got my second jab. Since then I am very very anxious and afraid of getting myocarditis. I am trying to cope with that but it's strange.
The last days I feel really tired and sometimes I feel a knife on my chest or out of breath. Today I was really okay but suddenly I was out of breath and then I felt super tired and scared.

"Iâ€™ve been dealing with GAD and OCD for 3 years now and havenâ€™t gotten treatment. 

Around a year and a half ago I saw a messed up video online and it definitely shocked me. The first couple weeks I felt outta place and could not really sleep well. Then time went on and it felt like my anxiety and ocd latched onto this video. 

I read something about Trauma and PTSD and all of a sudden I started worrying â€œdid I just give myself ptsd?â€ â€œDid I ruin my life over a video?â€ And since then Iâ€™ve been in a state of worry because of this.

The video was messed up, but what truly terrifies me is the fact that I gave myself PTSD, thatâ€™s what keeps this video in my head.

The only major symptom I have of PTSD are nightmares which I had like 3-4 of over 2 years, but even then, they bother me because I worry that I actually have PTSD.  Iâ€™m super cautious in terms of mental illness and thatâ€™s where my ocd usually started on, worrying if I had schizophrenia and such.

" Im 16 and life has been good for the last couple of weeks. This girl I met just came out of a relationship, and we've been hanging out and having a good time together. She suffers from a similar set of issues as me.

I woke up feeling loved/cared for at least. But suddenly maybe 2 days ago, it all changed. She didnt change, if anything she proved she really cared for me. But suddenly inside me, I felt like she actually disliked me. Yesterday we went out partying with a couple friends and she didn't really pay me any attention. MAYBE im right and MAYBE she really is just letting me go. But I dont think thats it, my logical brain is telling me that she isnt mad and that im just hyper-focusing on an issue im creating. I couldnt sleep last night and I cant think straight today. I dont hear voices but they are like thoughts continuedly screaming and pictures and emotions. WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO?

Do I ask her if shes mad? or do I let it slide? I can feel my hearbeat, I can feel everycell of my body twitch. I cant talk to my psychologist at the time being, so im completely alone.",Anxiety

"Iâ€™ve been stressed/anxious a lot lately because of certain personal things. Iâ€™ve noticed that Iâ€™m yawning a lot or just feeling like I need to take a deep inhale/breath . I donâ€™t feel out of breath yet I feel the need to yawn/ take a deep breath and itâ€™s causing me to stress even more because Iâ€™m wondering if itâ€™s just some adhd tic or something to do with the anxiety Iâ€™m dealing with . 

The reason Iâ€™ve been anxious and stressed is related to me breathing and my lungs so I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if that is edging on to the tics and making me more anxious .

Anyone have anything similar ? Is it just in my head because Iâ€™d hope so . I could try to just ignore the deep breaths but Iâ€™m worried itâ€™ll be unhealthy for my body. Like I said before my whole anxiety /stress is revolving around me breathing and feeling like I need to yawn a lot.  Note; this yawning this started yesterday and Iâ€™ve noticed that when Iâ€™m in public and just doing things like working at work I donâ€™t feel like I need to yawn at all.

"I just need to vent. Luckily my partner and family are all supportive but theyâ€™re not anxious like me so they donâ€™t really /get/ it ya know? These past couple of weeks over the holidays has been horrendous for my anxiety. I knew I might be a little stressed seeing everyone, especially with covid, but lord Iâ€™ve had like 3 or 4 panic attacks which is extra disappointing since I had been doing relatively good the past few months. First one was on the plane ride home, was a bumpy ride and I felt pretty motion sick, which sucked since Iâ€™m emetephobic. Then we made the rounds to both our families, seeing people and doing things basically everyday which I think just set me up to be anxious since Iâ€™m pretty introverted. That feeling of having to put on a normal face for an entire day around people Iâ€™d already be a little nervous around (relatives I havenâ€™t seen in a long time asking about my upcoming wedding) is just too much so now by the end of our trip Iâ€™m just on edge. 

Was finally able to do nothing and recharge yesterday, only to start feeling sick and found out today I was exposed to covid by a relative. The news has hit me harder than I thought. I know Iâ€™ll be ok since Iâ€™m triple vaxxed as is my family so itâ€™s not so much that Iâ€™m afraid of. I just feel like Iâ€™m stuck in â€œflightâ€ mode of wanting to be home in my safe space NOW but itâ€™s 12 hours away. And weâ€™re flying back in a couple daysâ€” will we need to cancel our flight? What if I panic on the plane again? Iâ€™m just at my last straw. Had another panic attack this morning about it, normally when I feel one coming on Iâ€™ll just let it happen if I can because I normally feel better, if a little off, after. But now I feel it coming on again even though Iâ€™ve just been sitting trying to relax and distract myself. Iâ€™m sure the fact I didnâ€™t get much sleep isnâ€™t helping.

"I'm curious if anyone has some advice, anxiety sufferer to anxiety sufferer, about managing anxiety in a relationship - and not letting it negatively impact the good thing you've got going with your partner.

A little context: I'm a girl in my upper 20s, diagnosed about 3 years ago with ADHD, anxiety, and some minor traumas. I'm on meds for both the anxiety and ADHD, and recently returned to therapy (though on a small vacation from sessions during the holidays.)

I'm currently in a LDR with a girl I've been seeing since the summer. Our relationship has been great and she's been very understanding and supportive of my needs, and mine of hers (she also suffers from some form of anxiety/depression, as well as dysphoria from being transgender.) We both have had some concerns about our mental illnesses coming into the relationship, but honestly it's been great so far. Not without its ups and downs, but any problems we face are typically due to outside stresses and never something between us specifically.

Recently, we had a good talk about a depressive period I went through and how it negatively affected her. I genuinely feel like I came out of that conversation much better prepared and stronger from the discussion and compromises we made, as I had never realized just how stuck in a rut I had become, and it was also clear that (perhaps due to my own failure of communicating my feelings or needs) she had perceived things as a bit more serious than they were. While things were going okay for a while, though, she's now also going through her own rough patch and has admitted that she recently has been feeling the spark in our relationship fading (though she admitted this may just be the end of the honey moon phase or tiredness from it being a LDR, and hopes things will rekindle when we meet up at the end of January.) 

Now, I don't know about her since it's her first serious relationship, but I've been in my fair share of previous relationships that have ended both positively and poorly. But one thing I find I have a big issue with is just general anxiety over small things in my otherwise healthy relationships.

Some of these I can chalk up to sadly projecting some shortcomings and bad experiences from previous failed relationships onto my current one, while others are just general overthinking and worries made up by my brain.

Some things that come to mind...

- Picking up on very minor changes in wording/tone in texted conversation and catastrophizing what might be going wrong.

- Misinterpreting small bumps in the road or outside factors as my own shortcomings or failures, over apologizing. 

- Discomfort in silence and space when not directly interacting with my partner.

- Balancing mental health and stresses between all parties involved in the relationship.

- General difficulties remaining optimistic in the face of smaller difficulties in life and love.

I know some of the best medicine for these issues can be therapy and good hobbies/other friends to keep busy, and those are things I'm trying to improve upon. Plus, I know there's no magical cure all for anxiety as much as I'm sure we all wish there was...

But how do you folks deal with these things? How do you communicate your needs in a relationship as someone with anxiety, while also respecting those of your partner? How do you maintain a healthy flame in a relationship between folks with mental illnesses?",Anxiety

"Has anyone ever beaten this? It's consuming me.

When I feel off I check it. When I feel good I check it. When I wake up at night, I check it. 

It's been much worse the last few days. On the weekend I was feeling it because I was getting a lot of skipped beats that I could feel in my chest. I was checking my pulse and it was steady, then all of a sudden I COULDN'T feel it. It just disappeared. I held my finger there for 3-4 seconds waiting for it to bounce and it didn't. I instantly panicked, ran to bathroom and splashed myself with water. At this point it certainly was beating, it was beating the hardest and fastest it ever had in my chest. I could even feel it in my left torso.

Since then my anxiety has gone x100. I'm almost certain it stopped. I wish in that situation I remained calm and waited longer, or moved my finger to see if I could feel it elsewhere. Now I don't know whether it stopped then went crazy after it got beating again or, I slightly moved my finger off it and the panic sent my heart crazy when I stood up. But since that, I feel like I'm checking it 200/300 times a day to make sure it doesn't stop again (if it ever even did).

Is it possible a healthy heart can just pause for that long? I've heard it happen in people's sleeps when they track their HR but I was awake (though it was late at night).

"I'm sick and tired of being tired... sick and tired of my mind being triggered and entering into ruminating mode... sick of looking tired the next day with bags under my eyes. I'm 30 years old, have been struggling with sleep for years, and just tired of being tired.

I meditate daily and practice mindfulness in my day to day moments. I also have good sleep hygiene: no caffeine after 4pm in the day. I go to bed at roughly the same time every night and wake up roughly at the same time every morning.

***Crucially, I am now 10 days into 21 days of abstaining from any alcohol or drugs. I think this is a vital phase, since I'm giving myself a genuine 3 week period to confront what is at the root of my Insomnia without alcohol, weed, or drugs distorting it.***

So, I am making genuine progress. But the reality is that some worries and fears are more 'real' than others.... no matter how valid a worry or concern is, I need to stop it from making my mind race at night time.

Right now, my concern is that I am going to catch Covid before my Sister's wedding next month. I have an auto-immune condition meaning I am very susceptible to Covid. I got my Booster in December, but still got covid on the 2nd week of January - 5 weeks later! 

My sister's wedding is on 9th April next month - and the very week before it, I am going to a football match in the UK with a friend and we will be going partying for the rest of the day and night once the football game is over. Everything is booked, so there is no way we can cancel or reschedule this.

I am going to get my 4th vaccine shot this coming Friday (I'm eligible for the 4th shot because of my condition). However, vaccine's don't seem to work that well on the immuno-compromised. Therefore despite having had Covid just in January, and getting my 4th immunization, there is still probably some degree of chance I will get it again.

Literally the week before the wedding I'm going to be in a packed stadium, drinking in bars and eating in restaurants, and on 2 separate flights - in a country, England, where all covid prevention rules have been relaxed.

So yes, it is a valid concern and I'm ruminating at night time about the endless possibilities of what might happen if I do get infected the weekend before the wedding - the biggest family event we have had to date. Everything is paid for, including my friends flights, so there is no way I can cancel this trip the week before.

Despite it being valid, there is absolutely nothing to be gained from worrying about it at night time, which is the whole point of this post.

Therefore, can someone give me some actionable strategies for managing anxiety and worrying at night time?",Anxiety
"My brother is currently a senior in high school and has been working to get his license since sophomore year.  I have not gone out with him yet myself, but from what I have heard from my mother, he gets flustered at simple mistakes and is prone to making harsh comments about himself, saying things like ""I'll never be able to do it"" over and over again.

It is a difficult situation because we live in a small town with no public transportation (excluding a pricy taxi service) and with him going to college next year, he will need to be able to drive there himself.  He often does not practice and when he does, I can tell that he is visibly anxious before and after he goes.

Does anyone have any advice as to how I can support him?  I do try to talk to him but I do not always know what to say.  I think part of the problem is that he does not have much motivation.  I try to bring up what he can do when he has a license, but he appears disinterested.  I have also offered to take him out myself to see if that would help, but he does not want me too.  I think part of it is because we are fairly close and he is afraid of letting me down.

Because I am in my mid 30s, I don't really want children, I'm not really trying to raise someone else's kids, I feel like the partner choices are extremely thin. The people who show interest in me I wonder how long until they find out that I'm no where near what they think I am.

I don't make a ton of money, but I am very good at my job, and enjoy it for the most part. It allows me a creative avenue that I need.

"Hey guys, this is kind of a long one so thanks to anybody that is gonna give it the time of day.

I'm an expat in Japan since 2018 and I struggled to find a healthy group of friends in my first couple of years here, but over time I built a healthy support system with amazing people. I'm kinda the ""therapist"" of the group, most people come to me talk to me about their problems and I always try to help them see where a good path for a possible solution is at. 

This makes me feel useful and indispensable to them, but I noticed that as soon as I cannot be present for an event or something like that, my anxiety skyrockets. If I see 2 people taking a selfie without me, I immediately jump to the conclusion that they actually don't like me or some other excessive reactions like that. I have been trying to work on this over-vigilance of mine for a few years now and although I can contain my reactions, they still burn on the inside.

Alongside all of this, 8 months ago I met this guy and we start to casually date. I introduce him to my group of friends and we all get along really well and officially became part of the group. Let's call him Takashi for now. Takashi and I grew closer and closer, we mostly communicate in Japanese since his English is not that great and even tho I'm fluent there's still cultural and linguistic barriers that we manage to overcome most of the time; he starts showing affection in pubblic, which is a HUGE deal in Japan, especially for gay couples.

 Everything is going well, so 3 weeks ago I confess my feelings to him and... He rejects me... He's like ""I like you and I don't have anyone else in my life, but I don'wanna date you"". That of course breaks my heart and I go on autopilot for a while. I told some of my friends about what happened but I don't want to make a huge deal out of this. I am ashamed that I feel so devasted about something so trivial in the grand scheme of things. I'm trying to take my distance from him and I don't text him. He reached out a couple of times but I replied coldly and kept it short. I'm doing my best even tho it pains me not to have him in my life anymore. 

But being away from him means being away from my friends and that's hard. Tonight he invited some people over for dinner and he didn't invite me. I understand that we are a big group and not everyone can join every single little thing, but that hurt so much. It felt like yet another heartbreak and I can't with this. I wanna be around people but the fear and anxiety of them leaving me is so painful that it just makes me want to isolate so that I'm not a burden to them 

I don't know how to get out of this loop, I've been thinking of taking a break from this people and try to find new friends, but that's so exhausting and feels so unfair. I wanna be that happy, cheerful guy but these burst of terror that pop up every now and then make everything more difficult.

There's also the added pressure of not wanting people to see my struggles, because in my head I have this idea that ""if I have problems, how can I possibly help somebody else?"". I know it's an absurd concept, that nobody actually thinks that, but in the moment it feels so real and mandatory.

"Iâ€™ve had this question for a while so I think Iâ€™ll just go outright and ask it.

Does this cycle ever happen to anyone else?

1a. You become friends with someone. You get their number, start chatting regularly, enjoy each otherâ€™s company, and spent time with each other. You make a friend like a normal person.

1b. Become somewhat closer with them than casual acquaintances. Share things about yourselves you seldom share. 

2a. Become afraid that you think that youâ€™re closer to them than they think that you think that you are

2b. Use this fear to become afraid that they think youâ€™re clingy and annoying

2c. Use this fear to justify the belief that they are probably annoyed by your presence and donâ€™t want to be friends with you anymore

3a. Give them space. Step 2 established the belief that they donâ€™t want to be your friend anymore despite no evidence. Theyâ€™ll notice, possibly say something, probably not. Slowly youâ€™ll drift which confirms your beliefs from step 2, silence is after all a sign of aggravation.

3b. Become paralyzed by fear. Even though you can see your relationship dissolving and feel the pain of loss creeping up on you thereâ€™s nothing you can do because the thought of even starting a conversation is simply too much to bear,

(Optional Step) 3c. Projecting. â€œWhat if theyâ€™re thinking the same thing as meâ€. A nice sentiment. Has no effect on behavior.

4. Total dissolution of union. After an extended period of isolation, the relationship dwindles away to nothing because thereâ€™s nothing left. How could there possibly be? 

This exact cycle has befallen me 8 times in the past handful of years. I think itâ€™s an extension of my interpersonal paranoia. Itâ€™s become an extreme impediment to my friendships. 

I just want a friend that I KNOW is my friend, someone who Iâ€™m not constantly paranoid about.",Anxiety
"I started a new job last week. Before I started, I was excited. It's a great opportunity and I'll be making a lot more money. The only real negative so far is that it takes me close to an hour to get there and for the first few weeks of training I have to be there early at 8 am. I'm not a morning person because I have insomnia and struggling with sleep apnea. My last job was understanding of this as I would occasionally come in late due to sleep problems. But they were 5 minutes down the road, not an hour. Ive had jobs that we this far before, but it was many years ago. I don't recall having any anxiety about those before. Also once training is over, I'll be on a 2pm-12am schedule which I would like much more than the morning shift. 

Otherwise, the job is great and so far my co-workers are all nice. There is a lot to learn, so maybe I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed too. I keep telling myself the positives, but it only helps temporarily, then it all comes flooding back in. I'm also losing sleep even on my off days because all I think about is this new job, thus giving me more anxiety. I was supposed to leave for my mom's house 30 minutes ago to help her with her buisness taxes, but I woke up with so much anxiety this morning that I'm bed ridden.

I still feel awkard in most situations, don't get me wrong but I don't go red anymore and I don't feel like showing any facial expressions whatsoever.

"//tw for driving, description of intrusive thoughts. will update the tw if asked because I canâ€™t think well

Fair warning, Iâ€™m terrible at being concise. Iâ€™m sorry. 

For context, Iâ€™m an 18 year old Enby [they/them please] who is _very_ mentally ill. GAD, MDD, ADHD, BPD, and PTSD all work together to make existing nearly impossible for me, on top of me being autistic and inherently struggling to exist in a community. My mother is diagnosed with the same things, but has always been far more capable than I. She holds down a job, she drives rather irresponsibly, she cooks, she cleans, all of that stuff without having more than a medical marijuana thing and a sleep aid. I, however, struggle to even tell when I need to have a drink, even in therapy and on medication. She expects me to be at her level because sheâ€™s able to go all this stuff and I could too if I â€œjust triedâ€.

I turned 18 on December fourth of last year. I was dreading it due to the crippling fear that, once I did, everyone was going to treat me completely differently and I was going to be expected to carry so much more weight when I can already barely handle myself. My mother assured me that it wouldnâ€™t be the case, butâ€¦well. It was. It was exactly what I feared. It seems like everyone is expecting me to just flip a switch and become functional.

I want to apply for disability because of how terribly everything affects my day-to-day life, to the point where if I have to go anywhere outside the area of my house, I _need_ someone with me or I just canâ€™t stay out there. I canâ€™t remember instructions well and even when I can, I struggle to follow those instructions. I need so many accommodations that itâ€™s unrealistic to expect any job to compensate for it all. My only job experience is with my grandmotherâ€™s cleaners thing and I screwed up all the numbers and felt physically ill after dealing with customers and was just doing everything so wrong while barely holding back tears that Iâ€™m not allowed to work with her anymore. Despite what I feel are genuine reasons to at least file a claim and see where it goes, my mother believes I donâ€™t need it and I will just magically be able to handle all these things. Even my therapist said that my issues arenâ€™t a reason not to work, and it feels so invalidating because I _really do_ struggle to do the things necessary to keep a job and even thinking about working with my grandmother has me in tears.

This brings me to driving, the biggest issue between me and my mother right now. _I do not trust myself to operate a vehicle while under the pressure of protecting not only myself and my passengers, but the people around me too._ I can barely focus on the road. I mix up left and right and I struggle to read the road signs correctly. I get so overwhelmed trying to remember every little thing I need to do and I canâ€™t get upset about it because my moms right next to me and sheâ€™ll probably be upset with me for crying. By the time Iâ€™m finished driving, Iâ€™m so far out of my head that I simply donâ€™t feel. Itâ€™s walking through a dream, now, and Iâ€™m just a passenger for it. The entire time, my mind is running through just how many things could go wrong and forcing me to sit through watching the people I love die because Iâ€™m stupid and didnâ€™t react fast enough to someone else. 

I donâ€™t think itâ€™s safe for me to be on the road in that stateâ€”and I feel like I shouldnâ€™t have to choose between feeling comfortable and stressing myself to the point of numbness just to get to a stupid store or something. Itâ€™s too easy for something to go wrong. but my mother insists that I need to get over it because driving is a necessary skill and itâ€™s not that hard and people who are â€œworse offâ€ than me can drive without a problem. â€œIt just takes practiceâ€, â€œyouâ€™re going to have to do it eventuallyâ€, â€œI can do it just fineâ€, â€œyour brother doesnâ€™t seem bothered by drivingâ€, â€œtoo badâ€”no oneâ€™s going to be your taxi so you need to get over yourselfâ€â€¦

am I the problem here? are my concerns silly? should I apologise to my mom for being so resistant? 

if itâ€™s me, what do I do to get past this? I canâ€™t shut my brain up no matter what I do, I keep trying but it only makes it worse. Iâ€™ve been through it with my therapist numerous times and I just canâ€™t get through it. 

if my concerns are valid, thoughâ€¦what do I do? how do I stop her from making me feel bad for struggling? how do I make people take me seriously?

"I have an irrational fear of texting, video chatting and meeting people. 
Whenever someone sends me a text or calls me suddenly, my instinctive reaction is to put my phone on silent and chuck it as far away from me as possible. As far as i'm sure, i think I've been like this since i was a child( I'm 21 now). I dont know why i get so anxious when these things occur and it's so bad that i can literally hear heart palpitations in my ear. And it gets more ridiculous when the person texting or calling is an immediate family member or close friend. 
Something similar happens when i have to meet family and friends irl. As soon as I'm invited, my mind immediately starts thinking of various excuses i could use to bail. And sometimes i fail to run away especially when the person inviting me is head strong and persistent, because of which i end up going to that particular event. And weirdly, more often than not, i enjoy being there. So why the heck do i keep getting anxious and try to run away each time this situation pops up, when i end up actually enjoying my time there?

"I'm  a 21M who tested positive in mid Jan. I had a very mild COVID case. The  only symptom that remained was a sore throat and palpitations.  Immediately after recovering, many times before I slept my heart would  keep thumping harder, maybe faster. I'm unable to concentrate on  anything. It was kinda intermittent just after recovery, mostly  disappeared and now has made a resurgence once I started studying hard  for my college final exams(customary last minute learning). Now its non  stop, for 3 days every moment in my waking hours has been spent in this  kind of anxiety.

Few years ago, I  developed stress and many mental problems after not succeeding at an  important exam in my country. I even developed dangerous thoughts for a  while. Few months later I got over it and I only got brief anxiety  attacks a day which faded away within a few minutes every time, by  drinking water, listening to music, exercise etc.

Now  I don't know what to do. No amount of music, relaxation, meditation,  water, etc. seems to be helping me.  I have an intense, excessive and  persistent worry and fear about everyday situations.  Sometimes I see  somebody on reddit have a bad life experience and I then imagine myself  in similar situations with imaginary fights, conflicts, injuries, death  etc. involved, despite me never being involved in any fights or violence  in my life. I'm fairly sheltered. Turning off social media doesnt help,  because when i watch a movie or a soccer match and see any conflict  there, the anxiety heats up again. And of course I cant ignore all this  and work as I used to be able to do, because its now constant and not  intermittent.  Ive been pinned down to my seat in front of screens  almost paralysed by the stress. Its not even like im burdened with work.  I had only like 2 hrs of work to do, home and college related. Unable  to do any of it.

"Hi all, 

Partially thanks to subs like that, despite being in my thirties, I'm now realising that others think the same way I do, and there are steps that can be taken to address them.

Like many who have described high functioning anxiety here, I'm very competent in my professional life as I'm diligent, can think ahead and spot issues before they become big issues. 

This is the positive side of the tendency to overthink and over analyse.

But the negatives I'm only now starting to reflect upon are 
- often catastrophising, assuming worst will happen and working from there 
- hyper focus on whatever is making me anxious, trying to analyse the problem every single way in order to he prepared for the worst 
- finding it hard to tell when anxiety and over analysis is useful and valid, or illogical
- avoiding situations or delaying through fear of anxiety, meetings, opportunities. Not learning that when I do these things it always goes fine.
- finding loss of control difficult - such as having to trust a colleague or professional like a lawyer to do something for me. I second guess them, I assume they'll miss the deadline, with no real evidence.
- while enjoying socialising finding it as exhausting as work and needing time to recover. If I see a friend after work it's fun, but I feel like I've not actually relaxed.
- often when doing something I'm just wishing it to be over, so I can get home. Never living in the moment

That was helpful in itself to just reflect on and just type out.

My question therefore is what are your best tips to deal with this sort of anxiety? Also are there any good books or online resources covering this?

 I will seek therapy if it continues, but I am hopeful that I can try to address it myself.

"Dear all,

I have been on this page for about a week now and have done my best to read all the posts! The community here is huge, which is great to see. 

We all have late of some form of anxiety. One is afraid to socialize, another has anxiety due to work or school, someone else has problems in their relationship and we could name 100 more examples.

As I read these posts, I am saddened to see how many people panic, or are very scared. I suffer from it myself and therefore I know in many cases what you are going through.

I want to say this to all of you: you are all wonderful people! You may have been told this week that someone doesn't care about you, guess what, I do care about you! I have no idea who you are or what you are going through, but I hope you have a great life and that all your dreams come true. I care about you!

Are you having trouble or work or with school? Guess what, it's all going to work out! It seems far away now, but you are going to succeed. You will get through this and you will show how great you are!

Are you having trouble socializing? Guess what, you're going to manage to get through this. The first steps are going to be tough, but you're going to show how great you are and that you can talk to anyone!

Whatever your fear is, don't think it's going to ruin your life. You are great, you can handle it and you will succeed! The first steps may be hard, but then your time will come and you will show what a wonderful person you are.

If you want to share your story, need someone to talk to or anything else, be sure to send me your message! I don't know if I can respond right away, but I will do my best to help you!

Have a great day, fantastic person!",Anxiety

I feel afraid of my life. The fact that I have some degree control (what job to apply for, where to live, how close I am to people) overwhelms me. 

Iâ€™m at a point in my life where I have no roots anywhere, no close family members, no close friends, just a partner who has become my best friend. He too has no attachments.

I feel like I might be obsessed with thinking about the future and what it should be like for me. 

At all times, Iâ€™m overthinking. I donâ€™t feel calm or at peace, my heart is always beating fast (except right before bed and after I wake up). When i was a kid I would journal but now Iâ€™m too distracted to focus on expressing my feelings in written form. 

I was prescribed medication but I stopped taking it after a short while (discussed with my doctor and they said itâ€™s ok).

I donâ€™t have time to look for a therapist right now, Iâ€™m too busy working my present job and trying to apply for other full time jobs.

Have you ever felt like this? How do you deal with this kind of anxiety everyday without medication? 

Thank you for reading.",Anxiety
"Sorry for the misspelling.
I struggle off and on with these feelings probably brought on from some old ptsd from a bad drug interaction several years ago. I also just think I feel like a robot and lost my zest for life . Iâ€™m on gabapentin for anxiety and celexa, but Iâ€™m just struggling with so much anxiety, I wanna make a difference and be there and help people and I just feel like I go to work, package beer, come home.

"So I was playing a game online with a group of friends in voice chat and one of them called me a slur relating to using illegal medication.

I always feel like I'm nervous when talking to everyone even if I know them.

I feel like asking him that was a huge mistake. Next time I joined the voice chat the guy's closest friend said ""what's up illegal medication user"". Apparently I can't write the word or my post will get removed.. I just brushed it off. I feel like now probably everyone thinks I use illegal medication and act different or maybe it's just me.

"Hi guys, just joined this thread. I really wanted to share this and I have few closed ones who are busy. 
I have a lot of anxiety. I donâ€™t know if I should see a therapist. 
Day before yesterday, we had a work party. I have drinks occasionally (three times a year) to socialise. No doubt, I had many. There was DJ, I was dancing. Got overwhelmed; danced a lot. I was dancing with this waitress, and suddenly my boob was out. (I quickly put it in.) I have been embarrassed and thinking about it since then. I am really hoping that no one saw that part. I KNOW THAT NO ONE IS CONCERNED ABOUT ME BUT STILL I HAVE BEEN SO ANXIOUS. It was like, after that, I felt like I was on spotlight. I felt like, everybody is looking at me, judging me. I am still thinking about it. 
To top it off, a guy I kinda have a crush on, was just in the same group, dancing. 
His friend was right next to him. I am so awkward, I wanted to make a conversation, however, I said â€œHiâ€ awkwardly to that friend and then simultaneously, I said â€œHiâ€ to the guy I have a crush on. Then, the girl-friend next to me said something to the guy I have a crush on. It probably wonâ€™t be about me but I STILL THINK THAT IT IS and I cannot stop thinking about it. 
I went to the gym today so that I can feel good; but to no vain! I came back and I am heavy breathing thinking about it; I just sat and drank some water to assuage my fears. 
Searched for â€œanxietyâ€ on Reddit to share what is happening to me to just be relieved I guess.

"Whether he said this in real life or not, a line from the Mitch Garabedian depicted in Spotlight says it all about my life.

*""If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse one.""*

Even today, I am subjected to abuse revolving around my senses and my ability to support myself. I am autistic and have experienced many times over that normies will change the rules on the spot just to make the person they have decided to abuse wrong. And today, whilst playing a videogame... hell, I will just say it and say I was playing Horizon: Forbidden West (I am very creative when it comes to managing what little money I have), I started to get a similar feeling. I cannot throw attacks for seconds at a time, but the enemy hits me five times whilst I am prepping, which means I have to start over, get hit again, and so on.

So I did something terrible a few years ago that I do not believe I will ever be able to talk about outside of therapy or the like. And part of the conditions of the court not sending me to prison was that I go and see a psychiatrist. This psychiatrist diagnosed me with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, and prescribed me with pills that helped a lot. At first I was just on paroxetine, then they introduced lamotrigine. Finally, I was switched to vortioxetine, and that is where I am at now.

The problem for me is that I am in constant thought about what I lost because what I have been suffering since I was a little boy (I puked on another child on the first day of school as a result of one event I might talk about if asked) was not diagnosed until I was old enough to be mistaken for a member of the generation that ruined the world for future generations.

It does not help that there is an organisation that has been given charitable status that is in reality a hate group against autistic folk like myself.

And now my psychiatrist has pretty much retired (he is in his 90s), and the people in disability services are trying to find me a new one through a service that I did not previously know existed. But I need the discharge summary...

Maybe I should just do something to get thrown in the hospital again. If nothing else, it will be a nice holiday (yes, I know my way around hospitals, wards, and nurses).",Anxiety

"I've been telling myself over and over again that I'm NOT pregnant. I haven't even held a proper conversation with a man in MONTHS, and I know I'm not eating healthy, so I have some stomach. There's no reason I should even be worried about being pregnant. 

Of course, TMI, but my period hasn't really BEEN here. It's always been suuper irregular, but it's stressing me out. I'm bleeding just a liiittle bit, but way way way less than I normally do, and after hearing that pregnant women can still bleed a little, it's NOT helping. 

How am I supposed to deal with this? This has happened before, a few months ago, and I got a test cause I was so stressed out about it. But I don't want to have to keep buying tests everytime my brain starts to act up, so what's a better way to calm myself down?",Anxiety

Anyone else feel guilty when they take a rest, or a break? Iâ€™m currently a senior and I just find it difficult to take my brain out of school at all recently. 

I feel as though a break will set me back and Iâ€™ll be left in the dust. But I know if I donâ€™t take a break, Iâ€™ll get overwhelmed and things will worsen, I know because Iâ€™ve been through it multiple times. The last one was so bad that the burnout went on for almost a year. I lost all motivation, couldnâ€™t focus, zoned out 24/7. I donâ€™t want that to happen again.

"Hi there, so long story short I have a 15 month old daughter and I had her during the pandemic and lockdowns. My husband has basically been working from home ever since however now that everything is opening up again he is also going back to work. 

During these last two years I have also developed severe anxiety and the fear or going outside. I am treating my anxiety with Zoloft and therapy which is somewhat working however I now need my husband to be home or with me at all times or my anxiety returns.

The thought of him going back to work and leaving me all day with our toddler is scaring me so much and I fear I will have constant panic attacks. I am trying to work through this in therapy however I was hoping to have some advice on here too as I feel so lost :( I feel like I am the only mum going through this.

"Iâ€™m 19 years old and Iâ€™m visiting a cousin. Today she asked me if I wanted to go over to her cousins house for his 1 year anniversary with his wife. I have an anxiety disorder and honestly didnâ€™t want to go because I was very anxious to go somewhere I donâ€™t really know anyone but I was pressured so I gave in. Everything was fine until the end of the night when she tried to tell a story about me that I thought was embarrassing. I asked her to not tell the story and she was like â€œrelax, itâ€™s fineâ€ so I asked her again please donâ€™t tell the story. At this point I started to get really panicked. She continued and for a third time tried to tell the story. I donâ€™t know how it got to this point but next thing you know I started screaming to tried to mask her voice so no one would hear the story while still saying donâ€™t tell the story. My logic was if they couldnâ€™t hear the story it would be fine. This didnâ€™t stop until the person giving us a ride home was like â€œalright letâ€™s goâ€ I looked up and just saw the look on her aunt and uncleâ€™s face. I didnâ€™t realize how mortifying it was until I stopped screaming like a banshee. I am so embarrassed I can ever show my face there again. When we got home she was so pissed at me and I was pissed as well because she disrespected my boundaries and ignored me when I said no. We had a talk about it but it kept going in circles. Me, telling her that itâ€™s not okay to tell people something I said not to and her telling me that it doesnâ€™t matter because I canâ€™t act like that in peoples houses. I know that. I am a grown ass woman and I shouldnâ€™t have reacted that way. My anxiety just took over that I really donâ€™t even remember screaming in that moment. Anyways, now sheâ€™s crying because sheâ€™s embarrassed and I feel horrendous. I tried to console her by telling her that itâ€™s more embarrassing for me. Nobody will blame her for me acting like a crazy ass bitch. Iâ€™m honestly still super pissed and planning to leave as soon as possible.

"So my relationship with masturbation has been quite distressing mainly because Iâ€™m scared of creating bad associations with other things I do. For example if I masturbate during the week, the things I do after or before it will begin to be associated with the masturbation. Like if I bought a game the day before or a movie was releasing on the weekend that was during a week I masturbated, my brain would always remind me â€œyou masturbated the same day/week you played/watched thisâ€ Im tired of the stress itâ€™s causing because it dampens my enjoyment of things I used to like. Soon as my brain thinks of a possible association before or after I masturbate itâ€™ll begin to obsess over it, which either prevents me from enjoying the thing thatâ€™s associated now or make me suppress my urges to masturbate. Sometimes it feels like my brain is doing mental gymnastics to link things as well, I used to only care if masturbated on the same day as something else but now it canâ€™t be in the same week otherwise Iâ€™ll feel terrible about it. I know why this has happened as when I first masturbated what I did after wouldâ€™ve created these behaviours since I waited till the next week to do anything, now a year later this mindset is still impacting me.
Any advice on how to get over this, because I feel like a lot of things still bothering me would subside if I get over this.

TL DR: my brain creates links between things I do that week and if I masturbate, which Iâ€™m tired of.",Anxiety

"Some time ago I was a sociable person, I had many friends, or that is what I want to make myself believe, since nowadays none of them is here with me, and that is why I am writing this.

I am 23 years old, I remember my high school years as a search for identity, how I am, how I treat people, how I interact with the environment, the context and its participants. It is today that I look back and all that seems to have been in vain. Everything I forged over the years started to plummet at the age of 19 when I had my first panic attack, a very strong one and much longer than I ever thought it could be, and that was just the beginning.

I think if my main obstacle had been that, by today my life would be at the very least, getting back together, but no, within half a year of my attack something even worse was going to happen, a crisis that led me to withdraw from society in a way I never thought I would. It is today that I know I should not be ashamed to talk about it, but it is very hard to swallow every time I remember it, even after so many years have passed.

Many people say that the worst betrayal one can experience is from a partner, a very close friend, but never, no one ever in their right mind could have been prepared for the betrayal I had to go through. It was not my best friend, or my partner, it was ALL my friends, together with who at that time was already my ex-partner, because they knew what was about to happen, and instead of appealing to their human side, to think about the person with whom they shared even a small fraction of their life, from one day to the next, disappeared forever.

They lied, they used the tools provided by social networks to fabricate false abuses, false manipulations, they organized themselves to create stories that did not have to ring entirely true, but that, by quantity, outweigh any kind of reasonable thought, anyone who thought about it for at least five minutes would have realized that there was something wrong with those stories, but it seems that the society we have today prefers to feel morally superior and condemn without hesitation those who may be ""bad human beings"".

From day one I always knew I was innocent, but my emotionality is still gaining ground, it is still to this day that I do not understand how a person lives a life when not only your closest friends led you to the gallows, but also your family for a while really doubted your actions, your casual friends or acquaintances simply ceased to exist, and one tries to manage to establish a life, but there is always the worry: ""Those people who pass by me, will they know my story? Will they know that the accusations are false? Even more paranoid, will they even know who I am and why I can't hide the social anxiety that all this has generated? Even after so much time has passed, it is still a major impediment when I want to establish bonds, not only is it impossible for me to maintain a friendship relationship over time, but also, having gone through all this, I no longer feel like having friends. Everyone talks about their friends and their importance, both in fiction and in reality, you can find people talking about how important their friends are and how they influence their lives. Who am I if, besides not having friends, I simply don't want to have them?

I talk to my psychologist, I have gone less sessions in the month and all, but I always come back religiously, because despite the huge progress I made, it never seems to me enough merit to think that I am worthy to recognize it completely, because I feel that every day I feel less human like the rest, and more a human apart, not as a missing link, but as a discarded link, for a reason that, to this day, I still don't know why, none of these people ever answered the questions I ask myself every day before going to sleep:

""Why me? What did I do to them to make them do this to me? Why did they try so hard to ruin my life and then they can't give me a damn answer?""

Hopefully I'm wrong, but I think these are questions that will never get answers.",Anxiety

I will start to overthink uncontrollably despite trying to self-talk myself out of it, and I am always at the verge of crying but could never really cry until I call a trusted friend to vent.

"Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt. For being a shitty roommate, shitty daughter, shitty friend, shitty sister, shitty girlfriend, a shitty granddaughter, an all around shitty person. Iâ€™ve let so many people down, thereâ€™s so much I wanna do, so much I should do, so much I shouldnâ€™t do itâ€™s so hard to balance. Worry, worry, worry. All I ever do about anything. Simple tasks impossible, simple questions, simple texts, impossible like a writers block, like a wall. Put it off, put it off till all the stress of putting everything off builds up.

If I donâ€™t think about it, it should be fine right? Until they all build up and everything seems impossible. Itâ€™s crippling really. Iâ€™m not lazy or forgetful, trust me I donâ€™t forget at all itâ€™s always in the back of my head, taking up space, weighing me down. They stack like bricks heavy and heavier, building a wall. Impossible, no I wonâ€™t even think about it. Simple tasks too stressful, too heavy, impossible. Then guilt why canâ€™t I do these simple tasks why are they so heavy so daunting, so threatening?

Why must I think so much? Why must I create demons who haunt me? Why do I expect perfection from myself but accept others to treat me with disrespect. The problem is myself I have so much hate, so much disgust for myself. I am not perfect and I expect that of myself so I will punish myself, Sabotage myself and invite others into my life who treat me as the vile being I see myself as.

The standard I set for myself is impossible no one can be perfect, no one is liked by everyone and no one can say/do everything right at the right time/place, no one can be in everyoneâ€™s life all the time so why do I feel so guilty for not being able to be there for everyone. Iâ€™ve let so many people down, promised Iâ€™d be there, Iâ€™d call, Iâ€™d text, Iâ€™d do something. But when the time comes itâ€™s so daunting so threatening it is physically impossible.

I have so much empathy, so much love, so much compassion for people in my life I want them to be happy I want to make them happy I want to be everything they want me to be and more I want to impress them I want to help them with everything. I see others as beautiful, perfect beings, they are perfect to me and I need to be perfect for them.

I constantly put others before myself. They deserve it after all Iâ€™m such a vile human I donâ€™t deserve basic needs. Iâ€™m selfish, Iâ€™m rude, Iâ€™m dishonest. I just wish I could be perfect for everyone just as perfect as they are to me. Guilt if I do it, guilt if I donâ€™t. If I call, text, speak they will hate me if I donâ€™t it will pile up and I will feel guilty for not being able to do simple tasks.

How do I win? Itâ€™s a loose, loose guilt around every corner. Even guilt for feeling guilty. Others have it worse than you so WHY am I so stuck up on simple shit? I donâ€™t even deserve the simple shit. Iâ€™m vile, disgusting, worthless, like scum of the earth type shit. Why do you even try? You can never win you will never be proud of yourself. How do I not expect so much of myself? I know I set the standards so high itâ€™s impossible but I still just feel like I should do better, be better. No matter what I do itâ€™s never good enough I canâ€™t give myself credit. Stuck in a shitty anxiety riddled self loathing loop I can never get out of.

One is our main chat where everyone is in,  then there's a game chat for those of us who get together to play board games, then a gym chat for the guys in the group that gym together. A lot of times I'll be in messenger and everyone else in our group are online,  but no one is chatting in the main chat.

"hi all, Iâ€™m currently in the best relationship I could ever imagine, but Iâ€™m worried my anxiety is making me a toxic partner. 

I have separation anxiety when my boyfriend leaves - my brain is constantly â€œwhat if he crashedâ€, â€œwhat if there was a shooting at workâ€, â€œwhat if blah blah blahâ€. I cry and always assume the worst if he doesnâ€™t text back very fast. I know that these are all irrational - of course there wasnâ€™t a shooting at work - but my brain does not like to give up the thoughts. 

I feel horrible because I constantly worry Iâ€™m a toxic girlfriend because what if Iâ€™m emotionally manipulating my bf because I cry if he leaves? and I always check my phone to see where he is - I sound crazy, but I feel like my anxiety is not only controlling me but controlling him as well. 

The main thing is that I worry Iâ€™m gaslighting to emotionally manipulating him into getting him to stay with me at the house when he could be doing anything else. What if my brain triggers crying so that I just get what I want? Also Iâ€™m literally a stalker?? checking in on his location to make sure heâ€™s not in a ditch when heâ€™s driving. 

He tells me that Iâ€™m not manipulative or toxic, but I feel like when youâ€™re in a relationship with someone you love youâ€™re seeing things through rose colour glasses and maybe he isnâ€™t able to fully see that I AM toxic. 

Should I start talking to a therapist again? Should I spend more time away from him to try and normalize those feelings? or is everything okay and I can just keep going about this the way I am?

"I've been on lexapro since nov. 21 for my panic disorder. I started at 5mg which worked great until about 1 month later I was getting that anxious feeling you get before panic attacks occur. I talked to my psychiatrist and she told me to take 10 mg. Another month later, same thing. Now I'm at 15mg and I've been having full blown panic attacks again and they're pretty frequent. I expressed my concern to my doctor and she keeps recommending to up my dosage but it seems like this medication is no longer working at all.

I (26f) have been having worse anxiety than normal the past few weeks and I have new symptoms of a tingling face and it feels like suddenly adrenaline is rushing through the front of my chest.

"I suppose the title explains just about everything, but Iâ€™ll go into more detail.

I really find myself having no attraction to someone until I know theyâ€™re flirting with me or already like me.  I think in my mind, I really donâ€™t allow myself to even entertain the thought of finding someone attractive or having a crush on them unless I know it could go somewhere.  Otherwise thereâ€™s no point and Iâ€™m pining over someone I canâ€™t have.  I also have a lot of anxiety about appearing inappropriate or doing or saying something I shouldnâ€™t, so I just donâ€™t even let myself even appear interested in someone until I know they already like me.

The trick is of course no one ever seems to show that sort of interest in me.  Maybe theyâ€™re waiting for me to show it, but I really have no reason to until they do.  They donâ€™t even appear as attractive to me unless I know they have interest.

Anyone have any advice on what to do about this situation?  Iâ€™m totally confused and donâ€™t know what to do.",Anxiety
"I was raised in a Japanese household. Very stereotypical that they care lot about what uni/college I go to and where I work full time. With school, I went to one of the best universities in my country to study engineering, but with full time work I wasnâ€™t able to land my dream job. But I was still very happy with the outcome, as it pays well and it is an exciting job with friendly colleagues. But my mum never seemed happy with the offer I got, she would say things like itâ€™s not Google itâ€™s not IBM and that. Then she follows up with you should study masters to get into better companies. I get where she is coming from but I just wanted her to recognise the amount of effort I put into landing a job. I am introverted and I am not great at interview type talks, so I had an hour or two to rehearse interviews everyday for like an entire year, studying extra hours for technical interviews and so on.

"         I've (22f) have struggled with anxiety for the majority of my life. Within the past 2 years though its gotten exceptionally worse. A year ago i was at probably the lowest I've been, multiple panic attacks a week, severe agoraphobia, and stomach issues so bad I couldn't eat. I got better though for awhile up until recently.

I can't afford therapy anymore and I don't have insurance. I'm just tired of suffering like this it's horrible.

"This has been discussed before, and Iâ€™m not asking for advice. Iâ€™m just here to say how messed up caffeine makes me feel especially today since I stupidly combined it with Zoloft.

"Hi TSR,

22M Here. I suffer from anxiety and social anxiety, which makes me overthink a LOT. The only thing I've found that helps me a lot is getting some external feedback/advice that helps me break out of my isolated thinking process.

For example, I suck at socialising. Whereas I imagine for most people, it comes very naturally. I am absolutely clueless for example, how to socialise in a large social group.

However, when I asked my roomate for a 5 minute chat, he gave me some great advice for tips on 'reading the room'. It is these little bits of external feedback that helps break me out of an anxious thinking process.

However, these bits of advice are far and few in between, so I wanted to get some advice on how to get them more frequently, to help me progress in life. The only avenues I can think of so far are:

\- Read Subsections of Educational Books (eg. How to make friends)

\- Hit up a friend for advice (by calling them eg. on messenger)

\- Ask roomates for a quick IRL Chat

\- Post on TheStudentRoom and other onlien forums.

"I'll try to keep this short and sweet. I have crippling anxiety, the kind where you have to quit your job and terminate your relationship because you simply cannot function due to feeling like shit/burning in anxiety hell all the time for seemingly no reason.  


Years ago, I  managed to find a provider kind enough to see how bad I was suffering and prescribe me some Xanax (Lorazepam technically), and after dialing the dose in I was able to function again (for the record I tried just about every other medication out there and nothing helped, including therapy). I was able to work again (and even was promoted to account manager within a year and a half) and I was able to date as well. I didn't even have to take my meds every day. Life was looking up.  


Fast-forward to now, and lately I have been having to take my Xanax everyday in order to function, not because I'm having withdrawals, but because my anxiety has been so bad for whatever reason. I hate having to take my pills because I'm concerned when my current provider retires, my next won't prescribe them to me. So I try and find alternatives, pot used to work really well but lately it stopped helping and even increased my anxiety....until I tried Rick Simpson Oil.... These last four days I haven't had to take any Xanax and I've been so much happier and productive.   


Have any of guys had success with RSO? I urge people to give it a shot because man I was (and in some ways still am) in a real bad place but this seems to be helping so far, feel like it is a fucking miracle atm.

"I've posted here before. Recently because of a period of switching a couple of medications, I've had an old symptom from many years ago come back.

Gagging.

My anxiety has always been more physical than mental. It affects my body even if my mind is not anxious. Chest pains, dizziness, etc. In the past the big thing was gagging. So, of course, it's a terrible cycle because I'm not mentally anxious at first, but then I'll feel whatever physical thing, and THAT makes me anxious which makes the symptoms worse.

So recently the big thing has been gagging. When people talk to me, I feel like I'm going to gag. I have to leave conversations because of this which is extremely embarrassing.

Does anyone here have recommendations for something that will help control my gag reflex? Medication? Anything at all?

"Pretty much everyone I know hated 2020, and hated quarantine even more. And I get that. It's pretty understandable why so many people do. But I miss it. For the first time in my life my anxiety felt completely gone. To me it felt like time had completely stopped: No future to worry about, appearance didn't matter much anymore, little socialization, no events were happening that I felt like I was missing out on.

But now quarantine is over where I live. I have to leave my house everyday. Everything that used to scare me is back now, and it feels so much worse than before. Everyone's lives are slowly going back to normal, and this is going to sound SUPER selfish, but I honestly don't want life to.

I would trade the rest of my life to relive 2020. I truly had never felt happier, and while I'm trying to stay optimistic for my future, I'm getting increasingly worried I won't ever be that happy again. Quarantine was exactly what I wanted my life to be like.

"I hate this so much. Iâ€™ve had it happen a few times in college with people I have to work in groups with the whole semester. Whenever it happens Iâ€™m like: â€œobviously donâ€™t want to cheat and also donâ€™t want to piss off people that my grade is dependent on on some assignmentsâ€. For example, earlier someone asked me what from the module was on a quiz for today and I just said â€œit was everythingâ€, because thatâ€™s what the professor puts in the directions for it themselves, so I figured thatâ€™s a safe, non confrontational way of blowing it off? It happened like that in a group chat last semester too where someone asked me if videos from the module were on it, and I just essentially said the same thing as earlier, since thatâ€™s what the professor stated in the study guide. It gives me so much anxiety when people try to cheat because I get paranoid of making people Iâ€™m working with mad, and obviously I donâ€™t want to give them answers to what they ask either. So Iâ€™ll just say â€œeverythingâ€, â€œthat and everything elseâ€, etc. Like just regurgitating what the professor puts out there as a blowoff.

"Hi, I'm 20 yo and I've been suffering from anxiety since middle school. In short, I would describe my anxiety as constant feeling of being in fly-or-fight state, i.e. when I go to the university, I feel so stressed and worried, that causes me even health problems (troubles with sleeping), but when you think about, nothing threatens your life, it's just a lectute after all. 
When I go to the park, I see people eith dogs and I've always wanted a dog, but when I think about how I can achieve that (reading how to properly take care of it, how to pick a breed, documents, routine health checks, the list goes on and on), I feel really stressed about all the details, so I better do nothing. I question myself, what person in the whole entire world can have a dog?? How is this even possible? I can't have a dog. The same goes for  almost everything.
And it's not like I haven't achieved anything. I live on my own, study in another country, but all those things I've been forcing myself to do. When I was sitting at the airport I was literally shaking, in the end I did it and I kind of got used to things, but I feels like a force, it certainly doesn't feel like life, it's just me making myself do stuff.
I've been trying to look for treatment. Maybe I needed a purpose in my life and then I would look at the world from a different angle and never worry? False. I can't build my whole entire world around one thing ""purpose"" or meaning of my life, I can't constantly hold it in my head. Maybe if I read books on philosophy or psychology, I'd become more aware of my problem and I wouldn't worry so much? Idk. I feel like this stress is somewhat unconcious and I have no idea how to fix myself.

Iâ€™m almost certain I have clinical depression and have been suffering for about 4 years now. Idk how to even start. Iâ€™m 24M and find everything difficult. When I was 18 starting college I was top of my classes, in shape and had a few women actually try to get my attention but I was so fixated on getting accepted to a university I rejected them all.

"So I have experienced my most serious panic attack a few days ago, where I was taken to the ER because of fear of death or trauma. I got scared that my hands were going numb along with tachycardia and panting. It was my 3rd biggest episode, and the first where I was fully sober.

I had experienced my other panic attacks when I would get high, and I would always experience rapid heart beats along with a myriad of symptoms, most often numbing of the face and limbs on the left side of my body.

I went to a few doctors, got blood tests, an MRI, a cardiogram and heart enzyme tests to check for any signs of heart attacks or strokes, because I had never experienced manifested anxiety and the symptoms, especially the numbing on the left side of the face, was particularly frightening.

My most recent one, and the experience that led me here, was after I had ingested a regular sized cup of black coffee and a cigarette. A few hours later I was at the ER crying and panting.

What I am concerned about, is not when I can get back to getting high, because I have cut that out of my day to day, but when can I go back to drinking coffee, tea, or a smoking a cigarette at a party without having to worry about this happening again. Do I avoid coffee altogether for ever? Have you experienced similar triggers? How do you deal with them? Are there any treatments? and is there any such thing as 'going back to normal' where I can get high and drink coffee and not shit the bed with thoughts of dying?

"I have severe anxiety and sometimes I get very anxious for no particular reason and it gets so overwhelming that I canâ€™t even focus for an hour. I am a university student so I need to focus on studying for long hours and same goes for my job. Whenever I get these episodes itâ€™s very hard for me to manage because it always starts very slowly and slowly creeps and expands over my whole body. Its like a knot in my stomach that turns into my heart pounding abnormally fast and my body shaking slightly. Itâ€™s hard to navigate when I canâ€™t even tell the source of it. It feels like Iâ€™m underwater and canâ€™t find which way is upâ€¦

Has anyone else felt like this? How do you manage and get over this long enough to do what you need to do? I used to have people I could rely on sort of like a support system but Iâ€™ve lost them recently so I want to learn to navigate this when Iâ€™m on my own. Any advice is welcome !",Anxiety

"Hi all, 
Iâ€™m 19 and I donâ€™t know what is wrong with me. In December after I came from the cinemas I had my first panic attack. I have no idea what brought it on, and since then I've been having constant anxiety attacks, with mainly physical symptoms such as trouble breathing, lots of yawning, unable to sleep, chest and back pain, tingling hands and feet, light-headedness. I could be chilling with family, out with family friends , uni etc and I get these anxiety symsptoms. Did this happen to you? How can I stop this :( pls help Iâ€™m desperate",Anxiety
"I made a whole post about what happened to me but the TLDR of it is: After two health scares with a medication that I was taking was giving me heart palpitations, and one choking incident, I now have health anxiety. It's affected my digestion (I think?) and gave me anxiety about things I never worried about before.

Now just to be clear, the heart palpitations have stopped because I stopped taking those meds, but it's left me with anxiety, also that choking incident.

It's been almost a month since this all has happened and I've gotten better but I still have anxiety, especially when it comes to food. I'm afraid I'm going to have an allergic reaction, which is ridiculous because I'm not allergic to anything (that I'm aware of) and have never had a reaction to anything before. I'm even sometimes scared to eat food I've eaten before, afraid that this time it will affect me.

I'm also scared to start exercising after the heart palpitations thing, something I was never afraid of before.

Obviously I still eat, even if I'm scared, but how do I get over this? Sometimes I suspect I have Laryngopharyngeal reflux, but I think it's my anxiety. How do I stop this weird fear?",Anxiety

"Just sharing two things that have helped me lately with anxiety

L-theanine supplements (recommended by therapist and approved by MD) have helped to reduce physical symptoms of anxiety, I take it preventatively on days when I know Iâ€™ll be in an anxiety inducing situation 

I worked with my therapist on a hypnotism session and it really helped with my severe fear of flying (took a flight three days later, and that plus L-Theanine had me unprecedentedly calm all the way through the airport, into the plane, and even for take off. Didnâ€™t have my heart race and anxious thoughts until we flew right over a massive epic lightning storm on the gulf of Mexico). I think a few more hypnotism sessions will make a big difference. Itâ€™s not what I thought it was at all! â€œAll hypnotism is self hypnotismâ€ - almost like a deeply relaxing form of meditation where you are not triggered and can rewire your brain to accept the possibility of being calm in a certain scenario.

Anyone else had success with either of these?",Anxiety

" *FYI I have never posted anything before on Reddit but am a constant reader. I will keep this as concise as possible to try and avoid TLDR. I am not political and wont be getting political in my posts just saying.*

That outta the way, I am Ben, 32 years old living in central FL with my soon to be wife and 2.5 year old son. Were not loaded, have little control over things. Work when were sick and all that stuff. I work full time, play games and 3d print for fun when I'm not being Dad.

I have been diagnosed and treated with Depression, GAD, and Panic disorder and have dealt with it for several years now, since I was 25. Its grown with me, fears and unnational thoughts evolving along with me. From the beginning, afraid to go out, afraid to go to sleep, fears that someone unknown would try to kill me. As I have gotten over all of that and function about 85% normally now, today its a  whole new beast. This monster came first as fear of my family not making through the pandemic and now the extremely unlikely but not totally impossible outcome of complete global annihilation at the hands of men I have never even met in my life. (Referring to RU &amp; US deciding to renovate Earth).

But to cut to the chase, what really worries me so much isn't perishing myself anymore. All of my fears have shifted to fearing what my 2.5 year old son may have to endure. And when I have been especially weak I get these intrusive thoughts, horrible, terrible thoughts. Like a bad Hollywood movie where the bomb goes off and me and my family all cry out. Then we catch fire and the screaming starts, and the last thing I think of is my son burning to death screaming and crying in pain and terror as we all go down.

Now that I have said all that dark terrible stuff, what I really want to know is, are there any parents out there who are just as worried as I am and have to battle these terrible thoughts and feelings. If there are how do you deal with it?

I just want to be a strong father figure and be the rock of my family and I am finding that it is so much harder than I could've imagined. Just looking for any kind of input really, it would be much appreciated.",Anxiety

"Iv never been diagnosed with this type before but after months of it gone and got to a level of it not being there I've just sat down watching TV and I had my mind flood with all this thoughts of stabbing my temple. It went like u was sitting there all day iv been worried my prozac side effects which I stopped that drug on end of August due to the onset of the thoughts and they did go or got to a low level. I was sitting there and one came in my mind and then another them another and loads came in I thought oh no I'm going like this again and literally felt the exact same as I did when I had them really bad. I just felt like crying going to my farther and saying I think I'm going back to how I was.

I went into another room and lay down and my heart was beating really fast extremely fast actually then it all stopped and I went back to normal.

I don't know really what's just happend I mean tge thoughts still there right now but not much Al day I was fine in fact I wasn't even having thought most of the week.

I think my thoughts may have been triggerd maybe. When I was in the prime of these thoughts I sat downstairs with my farther and it was dark like it was just then and I don't know maybe cause I was questioning why I may have had the thoughts earlier that I may have had a flashback or some deja vu that triggerd the thoughts and how I felt again.

Just to make it clear I'm diagnosed with pc and I'm not diagnosed with suicidal ocd it's just iv been having them for around nearly a year and have a therapist. I'm not suicidal but am pretty confused and freaked out about what happend.",Anxiety

"I got mono and have now been suffering from mental exhaustion, lack of concentration, anhedonia, derealization, I feel like Iâ€™m in an actual dream etc. then I have this stupid chronic bloating that never goes away. It came on slowly over the years and now itâ€™s an everyday thing. Iâ€™ve tried everything. I cut out gluten, soy, dairy, corn, tried probiotics, fermented foods, digestive enzymes, ox bile, betaine hcl, cutting out added sugar, more fiber, oxy powder and other things to help me go, moving more. Literally EVERYTHING. I feel so bloated and full all the time even after a little bit of food. I canâ€™t wear want I want, eat what I want, and I hate my stupid body. Everyone tells me itâ€™s going to get better and we are going to find the cause of my bloating and the mental issues from mono are going to go away but Iâ€™m really starting to doubt it. Iâ€™ve lost track of how many months itâ€™s been feeling like this. I seriously just hate my body for making me feel this way.

"So I've been having severe panic attacks, suffered for most of my late teenage and adult life with anxiety, never medicated before, but they became too much for me to deal with. 

The doctor prescribed me 40mg propranolol to take when I have a panic attack, no more than once a day, I also have a blood test and ECG booked to be on the safe side. I took one for the first time last night as I had a panic attack, and I'm blown away by the results. I know it only deals with physical symptoms, but I feel like my mental issues have followed suit. 

My mind feels quieter, I feel calm, I'm not suffering from derealization any more. The biggest difference though, is now I'm not having physical symptoms, I have a quiet mind, my thoughts aren't racing, and I can concentrate, and I'd forgotten what that was like. I'm so happy with the results. I won't take this daily if I can help it, only when it's necessary. Does anybody else have long term success stories with propranolol? As it is my first time taking it, I was interested to know if anybody else found it has such positive results.",Anxiety
"Hi guys! I (18F) just wanted to type out a little bit of what I am going through in hopes that someone is going through something similar or that anyone can offer some piece of advice!

My anxiety started about a month into my first semester of college (August 2021) . I also had just gotten really bad stomach problems at the time (what I later found out to be IBS), so I figured that the anxiety was just a part of the stomach business. However, my stomach has gotten a lot better. I still have very rough days with my IBS condition but nothing compared to what was going on before I got on medication. So I guess now I just feel hopeless because even though my stomach has improved so much, my anxiety has gotten significantly worse. I can't even pinpoint certain things that make me anxious- a lot of the time I feel like I have this horrible feeling for no reason. I definitely get very anxious before socializing or meeting with people, and I have never had a problem with talking to people until now. A big frustration I have from my anxiety is traveling back and forth from school. I love my family and love being home, but every time I have to go home or back to school I fall into at least a 3 day period of crippling anxiety attacks. This is so frustrating for me because once I move from one place to another and get settled in, I have to pick everything back up and walk right back into the anxiety. This leads me into my next point- eating. With my IBS, my eating habits have changed significantly and I am still learning the way that my body works and responds to certain foods. When I get these anxiety attacks, I cannot eat and sometimes this will go on for days. Not eating brings me even MORE anxiety because I have had a lot of issues with under-eating and getting sick from that. Since I have left for college in August, I have lost 15 pounds. Absolutely none of it was intentional. 

So basically to sum everything up it feels like I am walking on eggshells around my own life. The feeling I get from this anxiety is honestly inexplainable but it always feels like I'm worried about something, having BAD butterflies in my stomach, or just straight stomach pain. I also get a lot of heat flashes when I feel anxious which makes matters even worse. I don't want to live like this anymore, I feel like I am scared of living. I truly think life is so beautiful but I don't understand how to get out of this horrible feeling and it makes me feel like I am not living my life to its full potential. 

Any responses will help. They don't need to be helpful, just want to know someones out there!!",Anxiety

"Interviewed with a company over the last couple of weeks. Last week, they asked for a few references. One of which emailed me to let me know that they called her and she gave me glowing reviews which I appreciated. Another part of the process was that I asked the company if I could have a third zoom call with another member of the team. I wanted to get a well rounded view of the company, and try to gauge experience based on different roles. They happily obliged and I spoke with another team member on Thursday. On Friday (yesterday) I emailed both the team member and executive to say I appreciated that third call.

And now I wait... anxiously. I know you're not supposed to put all your eggs in one basket. But I am so tired from applying and interviewing that it would feel great to get an offer.

"Okay so idk if this is the right group to post this in but I'm just gonna say it here. I'm not sure if this is a vent, rant, or just a simply cry for advice and help but for the past idk, 3 days or so I haven't been sleeping. I'm a ""night owl"" and so I've just been staying up, playing my game and watching YouTube. Well, obviously that has affected my sleep schedule. When I was in school my sleep schedule used to be from going to bed at 9pm and waking up at 5:30-6am. Well now that I'm not in school it has been going to bed at 6-7am and waking up at 2-3pm then staying up until 6-7am. Well I guess that has finally caught up to me because a couple days ago I woke up and was just in a constant anxiety state and feeling so sick and nauseous, my mother came over and I told her what was going on and she gave me my 2 night time anxiety herbal pills and that usually works, I've been taking it ever since I was in 7th grade I think but as I got older it stopped working slowly. Anyways, I took those two pills and within probably about 20 minutes or so I got the feeling of being tired and ready to go to sleep but my body and brain couldn't ""switch off"" if you will. It was awful. My mom went downstairs to spend time with my dad (they're separated if you're wondering) and I sort of just sat there, crying, wanting to throw up and feeling like I was going to at any given second, I went downstairs and just broke apart and said ""I just want to sleep, that's all I want"" which leads to a little later that day. I guess I fell asleep on the couch and I woke up and I felt a bit better, then later on I fell asleep again and woke up about 9.5 hours later, which leads to yesterday I woke up, I didn't feel sick or anything but I felt unbelievably exhausted and I didn't know why. Later on I went to take a shower and I felt good, but at the end of the shower I began to feel sick again which lead me to spend about 15 minutes in the bathroom, hunched over the toilet, waiting for the inevitable to happen. It didn't happen. So I got into PJs, got my blankets and stuffed animals and made myself a ""comfort setup"" on the couch, which leads me to today, I had the best, longest sleep I ever had, I don't think I ever had that good of a sleep since a few years ago. Anywho, I feel good today, not really tired, not crying, no big anxiety attack, just my stomach is flip-floppy. I guess I woke up at times during the night but I was still asleep but I could hear my mother and father talking and it turns out, quite a lot is going on that my father isn't telling me, which I get, he isn't really the type of person to say some type of big things like this to me. Then I heard them talk about me, about how my father is just letting me sleep and my mother said that that's good and then I heard my father say something that sort of stuck with me all day, he said: ""The problem is she's got too much time and she spends all day in her head"" and so all day today I've been trying to distract myself with watching tv and positive thoughts. I've been trying to eat things that are ""light"" so that I wouldn't upset my stomach too much. So I guess I'm asking, any advice for this? What can I do to make it better? Will time just do it's thing? I know this is a long post but I think this talking about this and reaching out for help kind of helped a bit. If you made it this far, thank you for taking time to read this and please let me know any advice or what you do in this situation, I could really use some new coping methods.",Anxiety

"Iâ€™ve been suffering from anxiety for 5 years. Itâ€™s been hell, itâ€™s been crazy. I felt abnormal and like an alien - it felt like everyone could function like normal and do whatever they wanted with their lives - and I couldnâ€™t.

To put it simply, I suffer with social anxiety / anxiety leaving the house. I think covid made it worse. In January, I had had enough. I knew I had to speak to someone - I was certain it wouldnâ€™t work as I had tried other therapists before but had to give it a shot.

We are in March now and my whole attitude towards leaving the house and trying new things has completely changed. Iâ€™m happier, looking forward to new things and I can actually see a day where anxiety doesnâ€™t have a hold over me. I feel less alien. I feel like I have some control over my anxiety and it feels insanely good.

Part of me didnâ€™t want to write this but I remembered how these posts kept me optimistic in the past. I wanted to tell you all that it DOES get better. You are not alien for feeling how you feel.

"Having a hell of a â€˜funâ€™ time lately. 

Thursday: Got overwhelmed and started crying because of a fairly large task that I have to do over the span on multiple months. OCD+ADHD made me think I had to get it all done now or Iâ€™d have completion anxiety. Thatâ€™s where the fun begins. Unable to calm down, venting to everyone (and probably affecting their own mood), emergency call to therapist. By end of night I pass out from exhaustion. 

Friday: Wake up with a racing heart. Oh the physical symptoms are just a bitch to deal with. Have the â€˜anxietyâ€™ cough where I canâ€™t stop coughing for no good reason. Able to get through it with breathing, and concentrating on my work. Keeping busy helps a lot. Self sedating with many cups of chamomile tea. 

Today: Woke up with racing heart, nausea, headache, and no temperature control. This is the â€˜after effectsâ€™ stage of anxiety for me.

"For the past couple years, my anxiety disorder has finally gotten easier to manage with time and the right medication. Iâ€™ve recently completed my undergraduate degree and got a job while waiting to send my first round of applications to grad schools.

However, I recently got rejected from each program and quit my job as it wasnâ€™t a good fit nor emotionally sustainable (had to debate my hours on paycheck with boss, boss would forget to pay me and then blame me for not resolving the issue sooner when i brought it up, etc.). This spiked my baseline levels of anxiety. Additionally, when I got my rejection letters, my friends tried to help by telling me what I should do for myself and suggesting another career path as a backup plan. I think this (they meant well but it stressed me out) and my recent worries about money and the future have me feeling very depressed.

I have nightmares every night about money/friends moving away, I stare at my phone and walls for hours a day, and Iâ€™m so irritable that the smallest things make me furious for days. The other day I even had a faint metallic taste in my mouth which made me more anxious than I already was.

"Iâ€™m in the middle of a growing bought of anxious depression. Iâ€™m feeling really anxious about work and dreading going. 

Iâ€™m debating if I should tell my manager and take a couple weeks off. 

Now this might seem like a no brained: yes take some time and try to feel better, but my therapist has also talked about not avoiding things and Iâ€™d feel like this would possibly be avoidance and possible just a 1-2 week bandaid. 

Thereâ€™s also the stigma of mental health. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d face any real negative implications at work but Iâ€™m sure people would look at me differently if I had to take time for mental reasons. 

The stress on my job is all around long term projects not going well and uncomfortable conversations with people on my team who are likely not performing at the level they think they are, or the level they want to be. Taking 2 weeks off isnâ€™t going to help any of those issues (and 2 weeks of me being gone would probably mean things might fill further behind), but if I can get a little better I might approach it in a better state of mind. 

I also found references to this article https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140910102910.htm (I canâ€™t find the original anywhere online) which seemed to hint at benefits for remaining at work but Iâ€™d have liked to see the details.

"Hi everyone. Iâ€™m struggling from an OCD relapse (existential OCD). My thoughts are on a loop all day long. It feels like Iâ€™m going insane.

"Hi all, 
I ate something one month ago (pickled chili mango) to be specific. It didnâ€™t sit well with me, went to the toilet 4 AM had diarrhea where it burned through when pooping and it was very loose. I even had stomach pain when it happened.

I ate normal that day and everything was fine until 10 PM where I was craving a waffle. The waffle didnâ€™t sit well, it felt like something was stuck in my upper stomach and so it ended up with me vomiting and having diarrhea and bad bowel movements the whole night.

3-4 days later I got better, but after a week I got corona (omicron) and I got takeaway (too sick to cook) I ate everything from pizza, ramen, salad, sandwich etc, I was fine. Until after my corona ended I craved a croissant with crÃ¨me, and it felt again like something was stuck. But this time I didnâ€™t vomit, only had a burning sensation through my stomach and also diarrhea. (The burning sensation which I think is stomach acid got worst when I got hungry, so when I ate natural yoghurt it helped a lot to make it go away)

After 2-3 days it got better and I was fine again. So I decided to book an appointment with my doctor.

I explained to her everything, but nothing seemed to alarm her. She even asked if I experienced any pain, I said no, only a little when I go to the toilet. But she says itâ€™s normal. 

She then proceeded to ask if itâ€™s only waffle and croissant that has tricked it and I said yes, everything else I eat is fine.

She then ended it with sometimes the stomach needs to reboot after you eat something bad / have food poisoning.

For a week now Iâ€™ve been fine, but I experience gas after I eat, specially 4 days ago I had burger and stopped eating the fries cause it felt too heavy to digest. I didnâ€™t experience acid or anything like with the waffle or croissant only with severe gas, and I had diarrhea the next morning. But at night it was normal bowel movement again.

Iâ€™ve been eating lots of salads, drinking juice, and eating healthy for 2 weeks now. Itâ€™s helped but the gas just wonâ€™t go away after I eat.

Since I ate pickled mango in February my stomach has never been the same. For 4 weeks Iâ€™ve been experiencing loose stool, then hard stool, then normal. (Brown / dark brown color) if that info helps.

Iâ€™ve had mild burning sensation 2/3 times the past weeks.

Sometimes if I eat something like pastry or drink a cup of chai latte it can trigger a burning sensation specially when I get hungry, and also a gnawing pain 4/10 ~ it goes away when I eat something.

My Stool has been normal for two weeks now, but sometimes I get loose stool if I eat something greasy like fries / burger. And I experienced lots of gas.

Yesterday after I drank my chai latte I was fine for 4-5 hours. Until I got hungry it triggered a gnawing pain and burning sensation above my stomach and also my throat. (I didnâ€™t get anything up) itâ€™s just a burning feeling.

The whole night I couldnâ€™t sleep. Until I ate something and it also helped going to the toilet (normal stool).

Iâ€™ve been reading on google and Iâ€™m so scared if itâ€™s a stomach ulcer. My anxiety has been on the roof lately and I hyperventilated yesterday the whole night. Went first to sleep 5 am. 

The last time it flared up like this was when I had stomach acid / burning feeling after eating pastry. Then it goes away but I still get gas / whenever I eat. Like my stomach isnâ€™t 100% functioning like it used to.

Iâ€™m booking an appointment on Monday because I really want to understand why this is happening.

Iâ€™m going to the doctor for a further check up. I donâ€™t believe this is â€œnothingâ€..

I grew up with only my abusive mother. Father left us for drugs when I was a baby. My mum never wanted children and struggle with narcisistic personality disorder. I opened up about my abuse to a professional at school way too late (17yrs) but was then taken into child protective services. I moved into my own apartment that I paid for myself instead of a foster family. I had a 60% job outside of high school.

I have struggled with depression from an early age and had some form of treatment from about 10 years of age. When I moved away from home I started having regular panic attacks. I went to a psyciatrist and had treatment, but it severly affected my everyday life (work, school,social). 

I never knew how to tell my mother. She and I stay in touch, since I was too damaged to blame her. I needed to inform her what was going on. I told her in the car one time when we were driving from lunch. She told me it could not be true, as no one in her family suffers from anxiety. She dismissed it and never asked me about it again.

I'm usually very socially anxious. I avoid confrontation. I don't know what got to me but I showed him a middle finger back. He then started yelling something and I tried to ignore him again. Then he decided to call me a ""cheap whore"" and that's when the other people at the library kind of started reacting as well. I went to tell the staff and they approached this person. I approached him too. I looked him in the eyes and basically told him to fuck off. He acted like he didn't even know me and I called out his bullshit. He was eventually walked out of the library.

It feels like such a small thing to do but in the past I might've done nothing. I might've just left the library in silence and not tell anyone. I was shaking afterward but the staff was being nice to me. I don't feel like my day was ruined because of this. I feel surprisingly normal.

I talk a little about what I like with my friends and my sister, but I never talk about what I like with my parents. Itâ€™s not because they would make fun of me for liking that stuff; they keep trying to express to me that they will never do that. Yet, when my sister does nerdy stuff, they have this sense of subdued annoyance. Like, they are going along with it, but they have an air of annoyance. I can understand it with my mom, because she suffers from the same anxiety as me, but my dad is always the most annoyed. For example, we went to a renaissance fair last year, and my sister convinced me to try cosplay.

A little bit more about me: I am a recent University grad from the USA and have been working full time in the social service field for a little over 6 months now. While in school, I took a lot of classes on communication (interpersonal, public speaking, debate, storytelling) as well as a lot of classes on sociology and psychology. I've always struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember (due to childhood trauma) but I have been to therapy to help me with this issue. Besides all the effort I have invested into myself and my social skills I feel that I am still lacking. 

At work, I find it extremely hard to talk to my co-workers and clients. I personally believe I am very good at understanding emotions and can sympathize/empathize without trouble but I don't know how to externalize my feelings. I wish I could say something else other than the same ""I'm sorry about that"" or ""How are you doing today?"" ""Great!"" ""That's good"" \[ end of conversation \].

"Iâ€™ve been struggling with severe anxiety all my life and have been diagnosed with GAD, and lately an old focus of my anxiety keeps coming back to haunt me.

Basically â€“ I (28M) fell victim to a Craigslist-based scam about 3 years ago and lost $900. In retrospect it was a fairly obvious scam in which I was provided a fake shipment tracking label as ""proof"" and was manipulated over the phone to put money into what I believed to be a password-protected money transfer. Obviously, my money was gone the second I put it into this ""password protected"" transfer, and I realized this fairly quickly, but nothing could be done.

Anyway, I basically tormented myself psychologically over this for about a year and a half, and it sort of metastasized in my mind to incorporate other things I'd lost money on or regretted spending money on, which built up into a $3,000 sum figure that I kept having acute anxious thoughts about. The thoughts revolved primarily about how much of an idiot I was, the fact that I was a young person (25 at the time) who fell victim to an obvious online scam and thus felt like a huge idiot and an incompetent, how my life would be so much better with that money, etc.

These thoughts have continued to recur sporadically, and even though I got back on my feet financially fairly soon after the scam, my brain keeps telling me that I'll never get THAT money back, that I'm still the same dumb idiot, etc., that I'm bound to keep making the same kinds of dumb blunders. I have tried many tactics to get rid of these thoughts, such as CBT techniques and weekly therapy as well as meditation and medication, but to my dismay these thoughts keep coming back often, especially now that I am a freelancer with a less stable financial life.

Has anyone here had experience with similar kinds of lingering anxious thoughts long after such an experience? Just felt like I needed to post this because I'm still too ashamed to talk about it with anyone else aside from my therapist â€“ though this might also seem more like an OCD/intrusive thought pattern, since GAD is my only official diagnosis I thought it might be OK to post on this subreddit.",Anxiety

"Hey everyone,

A couple months ago I took a âˆ†8 THC gummy that was 8 mgs. It took around an hour to kick in but it gave me a panic attack. I felt pretty great beforehand and then my body slowly freaked. I thought I was having a stroke or something and so I went to the ER only to test positive for marijuana, lmfao. 

Do any of you have experience with THC and do any of you use it for anxiety / panic attacks? I heard it was effective. I also plan on taking CBD regularly since it's not psychoactive.

I still have the gummies and I don't want to waste them. I was wondering if it's a good idea to get a knife or something and take it in smaller pieces until I can build more of a tolerance to it.

Is this a good idea or no? Since the feeling before having a panic attack was good I'd also like to get used to that. It won't kill me anyway.

My history: I do have a history of anxiety especially hypochondria and that ties into a fear of death. I also have generalized anxiety everyday and increased anxiety in many social situations. It runs in the family but I also went through physical trauma and a health scare that triggered it.

"Hi there, so heightened anxiety is something I have dealt with my who life and within the past couple of years I have been seeing counsellors and psychologists to help out. Medication has been brought up a few times but I never agreed to the idea (mainly due to stigma and I didnâ€™t believe my anxiety was bad enough for medication). Recently the topic of SSRI medication came up again and this time I decided to try it out. At the start it felt like the SSRI was like putting on glasses I didnâ€™t know I needed, aside from some unpleasant side effects. I ended up having a really bad reaction to the medication after a week which put me in hospital and I was told to stop taking the meds. After that I tried two other medications for a couple of days but it stressed me out too much that I had to stop. Since stopping my anxiety has been absolutely debilitating. I canâ€™t sleep at all anymore without a sleeping aid, I get nausea all the time, my appetite is all over the place, I canâ€™t go to university (Iâ€™m gonna have to defer this semester) because my anxiety flairs up so badly, I get crying spells, my heart races a lot now (sometimes I get chest pains too). I can barely make it through a shift at my job. I have no clue why I am like this now, and I donâ€™t know what went wrong? Somehow the medication had made me so much worse than I was before. I am wondering if the bad reaction to the medication flared up my anxiety, because now when I take a paracetamol for a headache, or sometimes melatonin to sleep, I get a fear that my heart is going to stop. I also see a psychiatrist at the moment for an assessment for another mental health issue and he said he wanted to discuss anti-anxiety medication options (alternative to SSRIs) at a further time.

"Hello everyone im 22F with a bmi of 21. I don't smoke but i socially drink. I was quite healthy i guess, and i haven't had any health issues.

So it's been almost 2 months that I've been getting intense pains in my lower back, upper left abdomen and heart. I don't know what's causing it. I went to a cardiologist who said everything is completely fine with my heart. Had a CBC which was fine, and had an abdominal ultrasound which came back clean aswell.

Lately I've been finding it hard to pass stool, it only comes in narrow little pieces and i have lots of gas. I can feel murmurs and different sounds coming from all over my body, even upper right chest and I don't if there's gas there. Im thinking that my pains though must be gas related but i don't know if that's true. Gastroenterologist prescribed omeprazole and something about gas but did nothing. I've also developed fasciculation/spasms which happen all over my body at different parts each time. They're not painful but relatively scary. My life has gone downhill, im thinking about ALS or cancer. I've had covid before i don't know if it could be virus related.

Lastly i get some intense squeezing pains, like there's something squeezing my internal organs, and then i feel my heart beating fast, it lasts a few seconds but feels like death. I get this feeling on my mid back, usually at the left side. Heart pain is also pretty intense. Its always where my heart is, and it's stabbing (would rate it a 9), i get this daily, but cardiologists say my heart is good. It's by far the worse symptom

All of these started completely randomly, and I feel like dying, I'm getting completely depressed help me",Anxiety
"Since a year I think I developed a bad case of health anxiety. It all started when one day I would try to grab a towel while getting ready for the gym and I felt an extreme sharp pain in my chest. The pain stayed for a few mins and I legitimately thought I was about to die from a heart attack. It went away and I still lived. This experience caused me to become super conscious about any pain in my chest area. 

Any sharp/dull pain, any twist or weird itch, immediately I feel uneasy and worry. This also causes me to have trouble breathing and a feeling something is really wrong with me. One day I called the ambulance and they couldnâ€™t find anything wrong on the ECG. My bood pressure was measured first high and then low. They drove me to the hospital, checked there my blood and ECG. Everything normal, doctor mentioned he suspects reflux to be the cause. 

Half a year later and I still stuffer immensely. Whenever I get any pain in my chest, however light or briefly it is, I worry about heart problems. Any pain in my arm or legs also add to this. I limit myself to low activity because I am legit scared that any effort might cause a heart attack. At the gym I barely do anything, because I donâ€™t want to risk anything. I just walk on a treadmill now. Iâ€™m also obsessed with constantly checking my BPM and blood pressure. I take at least 20 ECGs with my apple watch every day. Now Iâ€™m starting to think I might be mentally unwell. That my behavior and fear is a result of anxiety and not a physical health problem.

How to cope with this? Almost every day I have moments that last 10-60 mins where I feel I am about to die from a heart attack, during these episodes I also feel like I am not getting enough oxygen. Itâ€™s just terrible.",Anxiety
"(18M) Ive struggled with anxiety ever since I was 6. I remember crying everyday at school when I was in first grade, and I went through some really rough patches throughout my childhood. Not like traumatic events, just bad anxiety and sadness. (I say sadness cause Im not formally diagnosed with any kind of depression) My parents and teachers didnt always take my anxiety very seriously, which made it even worse at times.

Anyway, something Ive noticed is that I feel a lot more comfortable talking to girls about my problems than other guys. Iâ€™m also more comfortable being seen crying by girls. Ill accept support from anyone that offers it, but Ive noticed a pattern of seeking support from the girls and women in my life when I need it. Can any other guys relate to this?",Anxiety

"Hey everyone,

As i have a cardiophobia problem (the fear to have cardiac diseases, cardiac arrestâ€¦) iâ€™d love to see if some of you have the same problem.

It gives me so much anxiety, and obviously, browsing on the net to get some info is never good.

I just had some PVCâ€™s while just starting to shovel some snow outside. Obviously, as said numerous time on the net Â«Â Pvcâ€™s while doing exercice is a bad conditionÂ Â»â€¦

So obviously my mind is crazy now. Though i already did a lot of EKG and blood test. 

Do you have anything to stop your mind from thinking that Â«Â YES i am SURE i have a cardiac issueÂ Â»

Thatâ€™s what eats me alive. I know i have anxieties towards the heart, but this doesnâ€™t mean i couldnâ€™t have a caridiac disease and so, itâ€™s a bad circleâ€¦ if you need to vent specifically about your heart issues, thatâ€™s here i guess !",Anxiety

"So I started having panic and anxiety attacks about 3 months ago. About a month ago I went to the ER for chest and left arm pain after several panic attacks.

The pain comes and goes, but has gotten a bit worse over the past couple of days, even though Iâ€™ve started Zoloft to help with my anxiety and have actually felt like Iâ€™ve been doing better. But my question is has anyone else had a similar experience.

"A few weeks back I was invited to a party, I was very nervous to say the least. When the day came, my anxiety became so bad that I debated not going. However, in the end I decided to push myself and go, I couldn't let my anxiety prevent me from having a good social experience, right?

It was the wrong decision.

I have been to parties before and infact enjoyed them. But, these were always small- 5 or so people, unstructured and with people that I knew well and was very comfortable with. This event on the other hand, was a three hour, 15 person, murder mystery role playing party.

I did know before hand, of course I did. But in my mind, amidst the nervous feelings, I saw it as an opportunity to overcome my fear and try something different. Something new and exciting to help me expand my boundaries and make new friends. Little did I know how far it really would push me.

I went, afraid but hopeful. I got there, and all seemed to go well, until the actual game began. What went wrong? Simple, I was assigned the most crucial, and hardest role in the entire game. I was given the role of the villain.

I know how silly it sounds, and I guess it sort of is, but strangely enough, it was a lot of pressure! It was my job to lie, sneak, and scheeme for three whole hours. That was a long time, and needless to say, it did not go well.

To start, I had been so nervous to begin with, that when I was faced with that pressure, it only built upon my nerves. Questions started to grow and grow: What if Ioose really quickly and ruin the game? What if I can't make it fun for the other people and ruin the game? What if I don't do enough and ruin the game? What if I make an idiotic mistake and embarrass myself? Everyone is against me! How do I have fun when I'm on my own?

The game began, and I was so crippled by my anxiety, that just ended up fulfilling many of my fears. I was so frustrated at myself and my situation, confused over what to do, and lonely because I didn't really have the chance to work with anyone- for three whole hours.

And yet, on the outside I handled it like a champ, I felt like crying at so many points, but I kept a straight face. And when I inevitably lost, I pretended to laugh it off with everyone, all the while drowning in my embarrasnet and feelings of inferiority. And when I left, I thanked the host and told them that I had a wonderful time.

I didn't ruin the party for anyone else, thankfully. I did my job well enough, albeit with a lot of screw ups and embarrassing moments. Everyone had a great time- except for me.

What was I supposed to have done? Left early and ruined the game by taking away the most crucial role? Switched roles with someone and screw up everything? Tell the host how hard it was for me, and only apply more pressure on them?

It was a bad experience, and I am so grateful to have been invited and thought of, but it did not do me nearly as much good as I had hoped it would. It wasn't that I had lost, but the impact of one new thing to worry about after another had completely thrown me off.

That's all, I suppose. I needed to express this somewhere. I've had a good cry about it all, and I'm feeling a little more secure. But I wanted to ask if anyone could relate to this experience at all. And I hoped I could receive some advice as well for the future.

Should I just not go to parties like this anymore? Are there any useful things that I can do to make the experience better? 

I'd love to hear thoughts on this, thank you!",Anxiety

"I've always paid rent on time. My current landlord only accepts rent delivered via mail. I mailed out rent on the 28th and it still hasn't been withdrawn from my bank account yet.

I'm really surprised the went somehow didn't reach him by 2/1 because he only lives a 10 minute drive away from me. It's stopped snowing but the roads are still bad.

I emailed my landlord about it but I'm still worried the rent isn't going to make it there by tomorrow. This is the latest I've ever paid rent and it's not even my fault.

"I'm sharing this as a reminder to everyone that you will be okay. 

I suffer from severe anxiety and have since I was a 14. 
I'm also on the spectrum. I am constantly anxious. I typically have moments of calm and happiness but there's always an underlying feeling of anxiety. Feeling relaxed is more of a concept than a reality to me. 

It's difficult sometimes to not feel hopeless because nothing ever feels okay. Everyday tasks and chores can feel overwhelming a lot of the time but recently I've been working to make small changes that make maintaining everyday chores and schedules easier. Setting alarms to make me aware what time it actually is. Setting reminders every day of small but necessary tasks ie.dishes, packing lunches, ect.

I've also made efforts to try and alleviate some of the major stressors in my life. Namely my job. It's incredibly stressful and it causes my anxiety to spike constantly just due to the nature of my workplace. I've been looking and applying for other positions but it's been hard to find one that is financially equivalent to what I have currently. But I finally found one and they offered me a position last week.

I've also been working to be more active out in the world. I have severe social anxiety but I also want to go out and do things and explore with my son. He's almost five and he's at that really fun age where he wants to go out and see the world and learn new things. So I've been pushing myself to focus on the fun positive enjoyment that comes from going out and doing things and not the social anxiety that I feel while doing them.

It's been difficult and I'm not going to lie I kind of hate it sometimes but tonight I was walking across my living room and I stopped and realized that for the first time in a long time I felt like I'm okay. There was no consuming anxiety looming at the edge of my consciousness  waiting to consume me.

Of course there's that soft underlying current of anxiety that everyone with anxiety has, but that's okay because I'm okay. 

And I want to share this to let you all know that you'll be okay too. 

And I know that because I realized there wasn't some earth-shattering change in my life that made everything okay. There was no miracle that changed my life and took my anxiety away. No magic pill that just made it disappear. My anxiety isn't gone. I'm just successfully managing it.

And if I can do that so can you. It's going to be different for every one of us on how we figure out how to manage our anxiety. It is really difficult to learn how to be able to take control of the things that are making us anxious and minimize them. It's a struggle to not be consumed by them as you're learning how to deal with them.But everyday that struggle gets a little bit easier. And it feels great when you realize that you are in control of your anxiety and it's not in control of you.

Controlling your anxiety isn't some Herculean feat that comes in a single moment of strength. It comes from small victories over time. So every time you have a victory whether it's that you washed that dish or paid that bill celebrate it. Own it. It doesn't matter if it's no big deal ""normal""people. Celebrate it. Wear it like a jewel in a crown. It is a victory and you deserve to feel proud about it.

I know that you had at least one small victory today and I'm proud of you. You'll be okay",Anxiety
"Anyone else get constant nausea throughout the day? For me, itâ€™s not that severe, just a subtle feeling in my stomach and throat constantly, which is really annoying. It gets much worse whenever something is coming up, like having to go to school, but dies down quickly once iâ€™m actually there.

Honestly, I donâ€™t even know if itâ€™s anxiety or not. The nausea only started a few days ago, probably because of a new semester at school, but the school year is halfway done, and iâ€™ve always felt fine before, no nausea.

Itâ€™s honestly disgusting to see people like that here. This is a place that people should be allowed to voice what anxieties they have and if you donâ€™t have anything nice or constructive to say other that â€œget off the internet and go outsideâ€ then donâ€™t comment anything, these are real issues for some people.

So for years now, Iâ€™ve had a broken back molar from a bad cavity and Iâ€™ve been putting off getting it taken care of for so long. Well, it got to the point where I was in excruciating pain and the tooth had become extremely infected. 

So today, while at lunch with a friend, I couldnâ€™t take it anymore. I finally found a dentist to get me in the same day and my friend and I drove there. I ended up having the tooth extracted. 

It was a lot, it was scary, but I got through it and now I never have to worry about that tooth anymore. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I can finally relax.

Its got to the point where I don't even feel like telling him things, or sharing things I find interesting, because I don't want to 'defend' myself. 

I'm a professor, so I know its not the debating aspect that bothers me because I'm able to hold my own in discussions with colleagues or students (I really do try my best to admit when I'm wrong because I know I don't know everything, and I disliked teachers who couldn't admit the same).

ever since this time last year, or a little before, i have been having these weird attacks where it feels like i have to kÂ¡ll myself to make them stop. they usually happen when i get overwhelmed with thoughts. ive been having ocd symptoms for the past 5 years or so and the thoughts drive me crazy. its gotten better since i learned what ocd is, before that i thought i was just insane. i promise im a normal person. i have friends at school, i look like a normal girl, i function as a regular person, etc but at home i feel crazy a lot of the time.

the attacks come on suddenly after the ocd-like thoughts get too extreme. its like my brain shuts everything down because it cant handle the thoughts. i suddenly cant feel anything and it causes me to panic and hyperventilate, i dont do this anymore since i learned what ocd was (learning i might not be crazy) but i used to SH to make it stop. of course it didnt work but i didnt know what to do. 

the past 3 months I have been doing good and trying to stop ruminating, but the past week or two has been bad. i just had one of the attacks because my hair looked slightly different and it caused me to not feel like myself. it sounds crazy but i promise if you were my family or friends you would never know that im like this and have these problems. i havent told anyone. anyway i was freaking out cuz i felt empty and i felt like i looked like someone else so i started pulling my hair trying to make it stop but it wouldnt work. i put on my favorite siriusxm station and im feeling better now but i just want answers. why does this happen? i will see a psychiatrist when im 18 in a few months but i wont until then. im not telling anyone. please dont try to convince me otherwise, i dont want my family to think im crazy.

"I'm really bad at texting people back because I forget or get really anxious. I'm actually interested in this person but I kept forgetting to text them back so i kept being like ""heyy sorry lol"" then we would flirt &amp; it would make me anxious so i would put off replying, forget, repeat.

anyway I caught covid at the beginning of January &amp; that knocked me out so we havent talked much. now i havent replied since jan 27th :')

when this has happened in the past i'll just get so anxious thinking about it that I'll put it off until they lose interest &amp; unadd me

this is frustrating because i would like to try harder but i dont know how to get over my texting anxiety",Anxiety
"In 2020 when I was 17, I was being transferred via ambulance to a psychiatric care facility. As a young girl, I was horrified to be left alone in the ambulance with two adult men Iâ€™ve never met before. I was equally as horrified to be going to the psychiatric hospital for the first time in my life. The emt sat beside me often asked me if I was doing okay. As we reached the hospital, he mentioned he saw my doc martens in my bag of belongings. He brought up how he used to have a pair of doc martens back in the 90s. He asked me what kind of music I listen to. Turns out we listen to the same music. He told me he had a 3 year old daughter he plays guitar for. We talked about my bright orange hayley williams-esaue hair. I suddenly felt very safe and comforted. Before I got wheeled out, he got very serious and said he doesnâ€™t usually talk to patients like this and likes to keep it professional but I was different because I reminded him of a younger version of himself and proceeded to tell me it was completely okay to be getting the help I needed, that it was nothing to be embarrassed about and that it shows strength. Nothing has ever helped me more than that conversation has. I think about it all the time. The fact that he took the time to say those things to me on just another day of work for him meant so much. It really is the little things sometimes.",Anxiety
"Hi, I wanna try something for my anxiety but im really terrified of the side effects &amp; the initial â€œit gets worse before it gets betterâ€ phase.. ive tried sertraline in the past &amp; although it took away the cloudiness &amp; depression it did nothing for my anxiety. Is there something that works &amp; that doesnâ€™t have a scary phase where you have to settle into it? Nor bad side effects when coming off? Thanks

Hello! This maybe a bit of an odd question but I've been creating meditation/relaxing sound videos and was wondering if these would be helpful for anxiety? I would love to post some of these if they would be helpful as I know many people who suffer from anxiety and just feel helpless. If these videos can help at all I would love to share them. Also if there are any recommendation for certain types of videos I would be more then happy to create those as well knowing they would help those struggling. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!,Anxiety

Is it because I sometimes tell myself Iâ€™m unworthy of love due to anxiety? I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t do that too much to myself either. Itâ€™s so isolating. Itâ€™s the weirdest and worst feeling have ever dealt with. I feel so far from my parents. I donâ€™t know what I can do to help myself.

"I don't know if this is a side effect of my ADHD or Anxieties. I feel like my intake and consumption of porn and my attitudes towards my sex life are starting to get out of hand. I feel like I am overly horny almost everyday. Which leads me to consume porn and masturbate multiple times per day. I have also gotten into kinkier and kinkier types of porn and fantasies.

"For years now I've always been almost envious of my drunk self, because I get so talkative, I care less of how others judge me, and in general it lowers my anxiety. Idk, I just feel like I become a more enjoyable and fun person to be around, but I don't want to only be this way when drunk. 

I talked to my therapist abt a specific issue concerning drunk vs. sober, and while it wasn't something in general, I felt I might apply it to different situations. Esentially it was about bringing some of the things I felt I enjoyed/was outspoken about while drunk nto my sober life. But Idk how to do that. 

So any advice on that? Only liking yourself when drunk is a slippery slope I don't want to go down, so I'd love to get some of the confidence I have then into my daily life.",Anxiety
"I'm not a very sexually experienced person, and haven't ever been in a serious relationship. Recently I started to hookup with a guy, but I'm planning to cut it off when I go back to school to date a girl that I'm interested in (think i'm bi). What's been bothering me about both partners though is that I get extremely nauseous whenever I get affectionate with either person. Even just kissing is enough to sometimes make me dry heave or actually vomit. 

I think it might be some form of relationship anxiety, rather than any physical illness, since if I drink a bit, I feel completely fine. I'm attracted to both people, but feeling like crap when I see them sober and trying to remedy with Pepto-Bismols all the time isn't very fun :( The nausea typically lasts a little while (sometimes until the next day), but goes away when I feel more relaxed (like when spending time with close friends/family).

If anyone has a similar experience or symptom I'd be interested in hearing how you manage it. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just not sure how serious this is, and whether its worth it to try and talk to a doctor about it. I don't experience anxiety or nausea generally from anything else, and so I appreciate any advice since this feeling is new to me.",Anxiety

"Hey all,

Iâ€™ve been struggling with my feelings recently and I felt it would be good (in some way) to try and describe them by writing them down somewhere. Even though I wouldnâ€™t wish anyone had these feelings, it would be good to know if anyone can relate. I apologies in advance for the long post.

The short of it is, I am chronic overthinker! I overthink every important future event or situation to the point that It consumes my life and I canâ€™t focus on anything else until that event/situation is over with. I catastrophize every situation so I can never really look forward to anything even if itâ€™s something that should be fun.

Making any sort of decision that has even the slightest bit of importance to it is difficult for me. Iâ€™m constantly questioning my logic and Iâ€™m always seeking re-assurance. Even once Iâ€™ve made a decision, I will continually overthink it and keep changing my mind. I feel like other people involved must think Iâ€™m absolutely nuts. Sometimes I will delay or even completely avoid making a decision, this holds me back and sometimes means I miss out on opportunities.

Whenever something doesnâ€™t go right, I panic and canâ€™t think straight. I feel upset and even feel like crying. In that moment the fact there could be a solution to the problem is inconceivable to meâ€¦ I canâ€™t think straight, canâ€™t speak properly and canâ€™t focus on anything because my mind is fully consumed by the fact that something didnâ€™t go right or that I f\*\*ked up!

Iâ€™m generally not the religious type (although I do believe in some sort of higher power) but I have even began praying every night that situations/decisions go ok. 

My anxiety is draining and I really believe that itâ€™s holding me back and not allowing me to live my life even to half of what is possible. This is the saddest thing for me because everyone around me seems to be able to cope with normal life relatively well, however with me I feel like it takes so much more mental energy to get the same result, I feel like Iâ€™m so mentally weak. This is how I perceive it anyway.

Iâ€™m not wishing for an easier life; I just wish that I could somehow change the way my mind processes things and that I could be a more efficient problem solver or something instead of becoming an anxious mess when there is some sort of pressure on me. That way I can fulfil my true potential and enjoy all the good things that life has to offer instead of destroying everything in my head before it even happensâ€¦

"My boyfriend and I planned to go to the gym today, and he was really excited for me to join him. As he was signing up I felt the worst wave of anxiety. Then my boyfriend agreed to take a tour of the gym. Instantly I was sick.

We walked through the gym and I just felt everyoneâ€™s eyes glued onto me. Tears were welled up in my eyes the entire time and the moment we were alone I told him I couldnâ€™t be in there any longer. The gym was huge and packed full of machines I didnâ€™t know how to use. My boyfriend told me it was okay and that we could leave but I felt so bad leaving early so I told him Iâ€™d wait for him in the car. Now Iâ€™m sitting in the parking lot feeling stupid and anxious.

Iâ€™ve been wanting to work out and Im not really insecure about my body, I think the anxiety just stemmed from how huge the building was and how small I felt.

I havenâ€™t felt that kind of anxiety since I was in high school and donâ€™t really know how to overcome it. Any advice for overcoming gym anxiety?",Anxiety
"One time when I was work I started to feel like I was going to faint. I made it to the bathroom and started feeling worse and worse. I used my work Walkie talkie to ask someone to please bring me a water bottle from. Nobody was answering me. I knew they could hear meâ€¦. So again. I asked if someone could please help me. The manager finally responded and said â€œweâ€™re busyâ€ I said â€œplease I need helpâ€ and again she said everyone was busy and then proceeded to ignore me. 

I remember then I started to panic. I started sweating profusely to the point where I was almost soaking wet (not sure why) and I ended up taking my shirt off and laying on the bathroom floor in the handicap stall. A public bathroom floor. Gross. I was just laying there thinking I was going to die there. 

After like 20 minutes some girl finally came to the bathroom. I remember hearing her tell me to unlock the stall. At that point my vision was starting to go and ears were ringing. Loudly. 

Next thing I know I stood up, unlocked the door, opened it and BAM. Fainted. I fell forwards so I ended up falling into her. She caught me and was trying to hold me up and walk me back up against the wall.  I wasnâ€™t out for long so the next thing I remember is her trying to sit me down and not drop me and me crying (I think because I was momentarily confused and scared) 

I canâ€™t even imagine what this girl was thinking finding me laying on the bathroom floor, shirtless in a pool of my own sweat. 

It was such a horrible experience and I will never forget how scary that was to call out for help and have nobody take my seriously or come.

"Iâ€™m struggling with anxiety and I thought itâ€™s getting better but I donâ€™t know. I started Zoloft a week ago (so I know thatâ€™s not enough time to kick in) but Iâ€™m so over this. Iâ€™ve been in therapy for 6+ months and itâ€™s gotten a little better but then I spiral.

I get SO fixated on medical issues and spiral. I really thought I was normal and that everyone freaks tf out when they have a worrisome symptom, but apparently worrying about medical issues 20 years into the future isnâ€™t normal. I get convinced my parents are terrible people who have abused me, sexually abused me, are cheating on either, are abusive to each other (all without evidence btw; they werenâ€™t the best parents but good people from what I know. They were trying their bet). Then I worry obsessively about my friends and familyâ€”if theyâ€™re healthy, happy, have had horrible things happen to them. 

Itâ€™s too much. And i think itâ€™s gotten so much worse in the last two years. I recently got off social media 95% (I check occasionally maybe like 1x every 2 weeks or so) Thereâ€™s no point to this post; I just need to talk out loud.

"I would like to start with what the title says. I've had anxiety for a few years, but stress has led the way before anxiety step in. The haircuts come in from when I was in my teens and having taken great care of my hair, I used to grow it out long, didn't like shorter hair. I was adopted by my grandmother and we were living in my uncle's house around 2013-2014. He had bought a house to let us stay in, he was in the armed forces at that time. When he moved there around the end of 2014, he used to tell me my hair was nappy and to put a hat on when I'm around him. And our biological mother was sending us money to me and my sister and we would buy what kids usually buy which is junk food. He would also ask me what do I buy with the money my mother sends me and my grandmother would tell him I bought junk food. And he would me to cut all  my hair off or he was going to have to take me to the barbers and tell them to give me a bald skinned fade. And would try to embarrass me which I really felt bad about.

Now 2018, I was moved from that house in Texas, all the way to Georgia where we lived before we moved to Texas. I'm living with my great aunt and my biological mother and my biological mother would come up to me and ask me about going to the barbers and getting a haircut to make myself look and feel better. I said no, not right now because I'm now older than 18 and she would be mad at me for a long time and would not say anything to me and this has happened multiple times over the next few years. because I would cut all my hair off even when I didn't want to and regrow it and I should also put that I haven't washed or put effort in taking care of my hair since I moved back here to Georgia. Because that situation really bothered me and stressed me out. And I get very anxious going near or by a barbershop. Then since being here, when i want to go somewhere my mother would tell me, ""you need let that go""! ""And you never know who you'll run into"". I told them about what I had went through while there in Texas. I'm not working, I'm pursing a GED at the moment and so I don't like to be asked or forced to get a haircut. And one day this week my great aunt came up to me with $20 and said ""you need to go get that wool cut off your head, I'll go get a axe and cut it off myself"". And I got real upset I hate stuff like that and that's what I told them, we had a full on argument about what's on my head. And my mother gets mad and doesn't talk to me which really makes me feel bad and she's had seizures and things happen to her but she's better now cuz she takes medicine. But she'll say nothing to me at all even if I ask her something she won't look at me or she'll ignore me as if I wasn't there and all I could do is walk off. I don't take medicine for anything and I might add I also have IBS and stress and anxiety gets to my stomach like crazy, it hurts so bad sometimes. But she'll be like ""forgive us for trying to make you look and feel better"", because I would get upset for them asking me and she also said you looking like a ape with that on your head. And my great aunt the other week called me a bear because of the way my hair looked. I have some anger issues which really stem from Texas. I really been trying to ask someone else, because I don't want to make anyone feel bad or me feel bad. I do go back and apologize everytime because I'm very apologetic when I feel bad for something I did or think I did.

Sometimes this overthinking results in a panic attack and it is generally just very exhausting to deal with for both myself and the people around me.

"i donâ€™t want to think that Iâ€™m dependent on this one friend on mine (letâ€™s call them Jess), but I talk to them more than any of my other friends and honestly sometimes I donâ€™t want to be friends with my other friends because of the relationship I have with Jess.  To be fair, my other friends donâ€™t talk to me often either way and have very different beliefs than me, beliefs that make my blood boil since Iâ€™ve been personally harmed by the beliefs.  I talk to Jess a lot throughout the day on text and sometimes FaceTime, but sometimes their energy completely drops and they barely text for a few days at a time.

Itâ€™ll be dry, lifeless convos that make me feel like they donâ€™t want to be my friend at all and it doesnâ€™t effect me badly at first but when it lasts for a while or one text comes out and somehow offends or bugs me, it starts bothering me more.

This happens often since itâ€™s Jessâ€™s way of coping, like not texting as much which I get having depression and mental health issues myself.  But I hate that it still bothers me. It definitely worries me, because I donâ€™t want to lose Jess as a friend, but it also causes lots of angry overthinking and defensiveness on my part.  I start thinking itâ€™s because of this or that even though I donâ€™t actually know why theyâ€™re being dry and pulling away, then my brain starts to get defensive saying â€œIâ€™m struggling too but I try not to ignore my friendsâ€ etc.  I notice those thoughts right away and try to push them away because I donâ€™t want to overreact to something even if it IS bothering me, since the last time I did that (with Jess btw) I triggered my own morality OCD and ended up in a day hospital for mental health because of how bad my â€œam I a horrible personâ€ ocd was.

So I guess Iâ€™m worried about being (too) attached to my friend, being dependent, being a BAD friend, and a bunch of other things.

I donâ€™t want Jess being dry and pulling away to bother me as much as it does but Iâ€™ve done everything I can, from trying to keep up convos and texting them first but I only get one or 2 texts a day from them and I can tell somethingâ€™s up.  Iâ€™m sure this will pass and I hope they feel better really soon, but I want to focus on what to do with myself. Iâ€™ve tried distracting myself and thinking about my other friends or school, etc, but it feels like am obsessive thought just coming back and hitting me harder and harder and I wish it wasnâ€™t happening because itâ€™s convincing me thereâ€™s something wrong with me for being as upset and bothered as I am.

This happened recently with another close friend of mine, (weâ€™ll call her Susan) after a breakup between Susan and a friend of mine (we were a trio and close friends but unfortunately they had a fallout), Susan stopped talking to me like she used to.  I see her post often when she hasnâ€™t read my dm in weeks and I tried not to be offended by it and make excuses for a while.  The last thing I wanted to do was make Susan the villain and gossip about her.  I did that with Jess 2 years ago and I did everything in my power to make sure Iâ€™d never make that mistake again, since it caused real event OCD and overwhelming guilt.  I wanted to be a better friend and never let that happen again, to the point of not allowing myself to make a single choice they did they upset because then â€œI was the hypocriteâ€. 

Anyway after that long rant, my whole point is just that I need some support right now. I donâ€™t want to put any blame on Jess, even if their ways of dealing with struggles upset me. Itâ€™s not my job to blame them and say they should change when I know I can always find ways to improve MYSELF instead. 

Iâ€™ve done everything I can think of and I KNOW for a fact that talking about this with them will not change a single thing for either of us.  I just donâ€™t want to be a toxic friend. I donâ€™t want to be angry because of this, but I am. I canâ€™t stop the feelings but I do stop actions and o will continue to.  I donâ€™t ever want to gossip and make the same mistakes I made with Jess ever again and Iâ€™m doing everything in my power to not react to this in a bad way. But itâ€™s getting kind of difficult. Whenever I have a strong dynamic with my friends and that suddenly changes, it hits me hard and I canâ€™t help but internally blame and feel angry towards the friend. 

Is anyone else like me? I guess Iâ€™m seeking support and reassurance, but I also just need someone to talk to me right now because I feel like a horrible person and friend, like Iâ€™m insane.",Anxiety
"I've been wanted to change field of work and been seeing a career counselor last spring. I was at the stage where I needed to do some research on my own (look at jobs descriptions, companies, etc. and do online free courses to see if I like anything (been thinking about programing, UX design, project management, salesforce, etc.)). But I haven't been able to start anything. I feel so drained when I finish work that I don't want to work on the computer for the rest of the evening. On the weekends I always have excuses, or other better things on my todo list that I prefer doing (like reading books about anxiety... I'm single, no kids, on lockdown (so no excuse) and still can't do anything productive. It seems like a never ending project and it overwhelms me so much that I cannot even start. I hate my job and want to change my life for the better. But I lack so much discipline. Why can't I be like all my friends and be able to just enjoy life on evenings and weekends?! I wanted to take a 3hour-week class or volunteer 5 hour-week last year but couldn't because I was crumbling with anxiety about not having enough time (I only work 35h a week at my job). how do people do it??

"Has anyone taken lamictal for anxiety? I know it is typically used for bipolar or seizures, but a new doctor tried to prescribe it for my anxiety today and I had never heard of it. 
She said itâ€™s usually for mood disorders. I asked if she thought I had a mood disorder and she said no. She thought it could help my anxiety and sleep issues but Iâ€™ve been looking into it and it seems a bit much for what Iâ€™m experiencing. I just have some pretty general anxiety/OCD and therapy has helped me a lot in the past. I donâ€™t experience any type of mania, Iâ€™m very happy, and Iâ€™m typically in a good mood most of the time. I donâ€™t have massive peaks of highs and lows. Iâ€™ve had panic attacks and worst anxiety in the past but itâ€™s been years since any of that has occurred. 

Just wondering if anyone has had experience with this med specifically for anxiety, and if it helped or not.

"Some people just never understand what it is like for me in the rain and the dark. Well, it causes me anxiety. They might not ever understand. Right now, itâ€™s raining where I am. I work with my friend and I had to drive her home today while it was raining, and the sun already went down. I had to drive very slow to be able to get her home safe. I told her that I needed to call my mom because my anxiety was acting up and I started to see tunnel vision because of all of it. I had to call my mom to tell her that I was having an anxiety attack because of the rain and that it was causing me to have tunnel vision, so I canâ€™t see and she has to come pick me up. So now I had to make her and my stepdad leave the house to come get me so one of them can drive my car back home. I donâ€™t know where the anxiety all started. I was never afraid when I was sitting in the passenger seat because I was not the one driving. As I got older and I started to drive, the rain started to cause me to have really bad panic attacks. There was one day I was coming home from one of my other jobs in the dark at about 8:00 PM EST and I was driving on a road that had no lights, and it was down pouring and I couldnâ€™t see. Right there abs then, I started to have an anxiety attack while I was driving so I had to pull over. Itâ€™s gotten so bad to the point where I literally canâ€™t breathe and I start crying. I even lost it once in front of my boyfriendâ€˜s best friend and his friend girlfriend at the time. Both my boyfriend and I have anxiety, so I had to ask his best friend to drive my car to get us back to my boyfriends house safe. What is this anxiety going to be like when I have my own family that I have to drive to sporting events, or to friends houses, or pick them up from places before they could drive themselves?

"I was deeply depressed and anxious for years .After 3 months on antidepressants I have the courage to wake up and get out of my bed without feeling like shit.I don't overthink and my mind is finally healthy after many many years.I was really hesitant about the meds ,because I was overthinking it too much,but now I finally see a difference.I am not totally fixed I still have some problems but know I think that I have more power to solve them and I am not that anxious about everything around me .
When I was depressed I used to write about my feelings on some papers  and yesterday I found those papers and read them and I realized how much help I needed that time and I am glad that I took the step to ask for help from a mental health professional.

"I'm in my 30s and still don't have a career. I've never made much money at all, have a shoddy work history, and I'm really scared. I'm starting a job training program next week that helps you earn i.t. certifications and offers job placement assistance when you graduate. I think it's a good opportunity for me to finally get a good job, but this anxiety disorder makes everything impossible for me. 

I wish I could just focus on my goal, finish the program, get a nice job and live my life. Instead, my mind attacks me with endless thoughts about how I'm choosing the wrong job, I'm destroying my life, I am worthless unless I do some other job, I am choosing a meaningless job so I am worthless, on and on. I get these intrusive thoughts imagining myself in another job role and how I'm going to be missing out on all those life experiences if I do this instead, and therefore ruining my life. I can't get past this and it's just...crushing.

 I am tired of living like this, facing this constant dread and anxiety every day. I can't take it anymore. I think of suicide to escape it. It's so dumb, because I get the anxiety about making the wrong choice or missing out on the ""correct"" life path, and then in the end I up doing nothing, paralyzed by anxiety, no money, and no experiences at all. It's so stupid and illogical, but that's what this disorder does to me.

Subconsciously to me I liked the idea of staying home. Afterwards, she then asked ""Are you fully vaccinated? Have you gotten vaccinated recently?"" and I hesitated but stated I got vaccinated last year in April. The part where I lied(?), is that I never mentioned I got my booster in November. I think that booster was the only factor in me either staying home or coming into work. Of course with the information given, she stated it's been too long so I was told to stay home. I accepted, and immediately began overthinking after realizing one of my co-workers was aware of my recent vx booster. My anxiety has been through the roof as I've been anticipating them catching onto me and accusing me of lying in order to stay home.

"So I've had anxiety issues for a while. I just recently got into an amazing relationship 3ish months ago and my anxiety got worse. I realized I need to work on this anxiety otherwise I'm going to scare off my GF.

So, I really started to work on it and this week I was doing so good. I was doing so good in fact, the yesterday I was able to brush off all my anxious thoughts just like that and they didn't bother me... 

Well today I had a thought pop in my brain, it was over something really dumb... I couldn't remember if I said I love you back to my GF after I dropped her off at work. That thought was stuck with me, I figured I know some people worry about if it's said back or not, plus my GF has corrected me a few times when I for got the I in ""I love you"" (more jokingly but still). So I texted her asking if I forgot...... then my brain went super anxious mode and now all I can think is ""well she thinks I'm annoying, clingy, over bearing, etc etc and she's going to want to leave me."" 

I was doing so good (my anxiety about my relationship is more along the lines of I'm afraid she's going to leave me because I have recently found out I have abandonment issues). I wasn't worried if I said something dumb, if she took a long time to reply, if I felt like I was coming on so strong, and other things.

"I'm almost 30. A few years ago I used to work taking care of disabled people. I did it for years and while I liked most of it, I wanted to get out of healthcare and go into retail and retail management. I decided to go to work at a Walgreens and work to become a team lead. 

I'm a beefy guy but I'm soft spoken generally and pretty quiet. Throughout school and college that personality type did with my teachers because I'm not interrupting or anything. I just put my head down and get my work done. 

But in work situations, that has really hurt me. Because I'm a big muscley guy when I'm quiet people assume I'm mad or upset. When really I am really just shy and guarded. I'm very observant of people. Those that don't assume I'm mad or upset assume they can talk to me any disrespectful way and like a doormat. Then when I react to that, then it gets turned on me and they go back to thinking I'm an A hole when I'm not. 

I was super great with the customers at that store and built great relationships with them. I came in early and worked harder than pretty much everyone of my coworkers. Whenever someone called off, I volunteered to come in. Holiday season I picked up all of the holidays. I got passed up for the promotion I wanted 2 times because the assistant manager had been friends with these 2 other people who wanted it. 

The store manager told me I was definitely a better choice but because they had worked there longer they got it first. 

The store manager got promoted, and a new one came in. She saw how great I worked and wanted to promote me but there were no spots available.  I could've gotten one an hour away but with the gas I would've spent, it would've meant my raise would go to gas leaving me in the same spot financially. 

After 2 years, I left that store and went back to healthcare because I was so tired of killing myself and getting overlooked. 

Now I live in a different state and am looking for a new job. I really don't want a healthcare job again. 

I am super great with customers and very helpful with them and really care about their needs, same as I was with the patients. I am just not good in social situations with coworkers when it comes to talking about personal lives or gossip or anything. I try to be friendly but keep to myself. I don't know how to handle when people talk bad about each other or even when I can hear them saying things about me. 

I'm the type of person I don't care that much about people outside of work. I try to be professional and do what I need but I don't care about their stuff outside of work like when they talk about their kids or their husband or whatever. I keep to myself generally. 

I'm realizing now that I'm reaching 30 that my degree and good grades isn't what is going to get me in the door. It's not even so much of how good and hard I work. Being social is the main ticket to being successful. And it's difficult because I've always been told to work hard and you'll be rewarded. 

I don't have 400 Facebook friends. I have about 4. But those 4 are the ones I could count on bailing me out of jail, or helping me if my car broke down or visit me in the hospital. 

long story short is I am a guy who may not look like a shy introverted person, but I am. I'll help anyone but don't take advantage of me. I'm loyal and honest and don't know how to be ""fake"". while I can be friendly enough at work to people, I don't know how to be a social butterfly as a lot of people are. I get worried I may say the wrong thing accidentally and so instead I tend to say less and be more quiet. Due to my appearance people take it as I am mad or rude when really I'm just self conscious about everything I do.

 I've noticed this pattern in my life that my personality has held me back from my work goals even if I work harder and am more qualified. In school this personality has always been great for me because I never caused issues for my teachers. I was always the good student who paid attention and got my work done. But most jobs want the total opposite. I've noticed only with older people I am able to be more comfortable because they appreciate my style more since I'm more straightforward. But I don't know where or how to seek help whether it's medication or therapy or something.",Anxiety
"TW seizures:

So I was in this antique shop today and as I was checking out there was this LOUD crash. When I looked over there was a women on the ground seizing. She had fallen on top of a bunch of stuff and was breathing, but seizing and making this snoring sound. The shop owner ran over to her and yelled for someone to call 911. So I did, I called 911 and the dispatcher told me to get closer to the lady so she could hear her breathing. I was in such shock so I handed the phone to the store owner and the dispatcher said to start CPR (even though she was breathing?). Within a minute the ambulance was there and I took them to where the lady was still unconscious, but no longer seizing. I got my phone back from the shop owner and left. I just couldnâ€™t be in there any longer because my anxiety got so bad. I got in my car and just cried. The ambulance was parked behind me so I just waited there until they got her in. When they wheeled her out she was awake and talking with them so that made me feel better. Idk, I just canâ€™t get the whole thing out of my head and my anxiety is so bad. I feel bad too because I couldnâ€™t go over and give her CPR. I just couldnâ€™t do it and I feel guilty.

Fast forward to today, I have a fear of my mother getting a bad illness. Whenever the thought occurs in my mind, it almost gives me a butterflies-like feeling which scares me because I usually get that when I think of something good. And this is not a happy feeling.

I think the solution would be to just ask my mother to get checked for this illness. But I don't want to scare her by bringing it up, because she doesn't show any symptoms that I know of

"**Needing advice PLEASE.** My husband is waking up and around 8am every morning having stomach cramps, nausea, coughing/gagging like clockwork only in the morning, and only on the days he has to work (not weekends) the combination of past and current events has led to an anxiety diagnosis. I think he is having some IBS stuff.

Although work was/is a triggering event for his newly diagnosed anxiety, he doesn't feel that is what is keeping it going. In the past few years his dad got diagnosed with cancer, we had a child, he lost his job due to covid (out of control) to go to a temp. job for a year because of covid, now to having a good job again but now he is having anxiety which has prevented him from going to work some days lately.

Having anxiety myself i know things are easier said then done. Im wanting him to push foward instead of using PTO/sick time because i feel he has used A LOT of it already and its only FEB. Im starting to get really worried for him... and his job.

They havent said anything to him but i can imagine if this keeps going on something will be said. Hes explained things to his manager and his manager also has some anxiety issues so says he understands but also if this continues theres only so much the manager can help. 

He is on 10mg of lexapro since this started in JAN. and has made an apt for therapy through his works EAP but we are still waiting to get contacted by someone. He said his mind no longer races and heart no loner beats fast like it use to in the AM when he would wake up but still having the stomach stuff.

I says he doesnt feel depressed and from the outside looking in he doesn't seemed to be depressed. Seems like mostly anxiety triggered by all these past stressful events. Hes seen his doc and blood work has come back normal.

Its starting to cause me some major anxiety and im starting to feel uncertain of the future again.

Im not sure how to help him.",Anxiety

"
Iâ€™m curious to see if anyone here has similar physical symptoms when experiencing anxiety as I do. When Iâ€™m in public and walking with no-one around Iâ€™m absolutely fine. But as soon as someone is approaching me walking the other the way my eyes get very watery (sometimes to the point of tears) and my lips get very dry (regardless of using moisturiser and Vaseline). I definitely attribute it to anxiety as when Iâ€™m by myself this doesnâ€™t happen/if Iâ€™m under the influence of alcohol it doesnâ€™t happen when being around lots of people as my anxiety is significantly reduced.

Obviously being drunk 24/7 isnâ€™t a long term solution. It can really make approaching people or even just being around strangers really difficult because understandably the blubbering mess licking his lips coming towards you isnâ€™t most peoples go to option for an interaction.

Iâ€™ve gotten better at managing it by managing my anxiety with exercise/meditation/journaling consistently but itâ€™s still really prominent. Firstly does anyone else experience this? Secondly, if so Iâ€™d be really grateful to hear about it and if you used any particular techniques to reduce it or even get rid of it entirely.

Thanks!",Anxiety

"Hoping this resonates with other people who feel conflicted between two modes of thinking, one contained in the mind/imagination, and the other contained in the heart? The worry seems contained in my imagination, and my heart or body seems to constantly try to make sense of it-- validate it? Believe it? I'm learning to lean more into not believing the conjured worries, the imagined tensions/conflicts with friends and family. The imagined problems and responsibilities I've told myself I've needed to be attached to, like needing attention, validation, reassurance, help, care, and someone to worry over me.

"Hi!!! So my bf is struggling with panic attacks and he is constantly anxious. Lately going out ends up with him throwing up and sometimes crying while struggling to breath. I had panic attacks as a child until I was 16 and my case was very different, public places werenâ€™t a trigger; I know how to be there, but have no idea about the public thing. He used to be okay with going out, but suddenly the panick attacks came in.

Please, I need some ideas for Valentineâ€™s day. I promised him I would plan it, it was dinner at this cool restaurant but I donâ€™t want him to go through that, ik heâ€™s not ready for public things at the time. We already had dinner at home and picnic dates. It can be that, but how do I make it special? Or is there any option for going out that canâ€™t trigger him?

I love him and I am willing to change anything for us to enjoy our time together. He wants to do something and I feel lost. I donâ€™t wanna mess up.

I appreciate any advice and ideas you all have. Thank you.",Anxiety
"Hey everyone, still very new to all this so bear with me. 

Iâ€™ve had an anxious couple of weeks and I notice tingling in my feet, tip of some fingers and sometimes right side of my face. All only when not busy.

Havenâ€™t been able to sleep well either this week with how anxious Iâ€™ve been.

"I feel like in the evening all of my anxieties and insecurities increase; I get this 2-3 minute moment where I feel really sad, really scared and like I'm in danger.

It manifests as anxiety through not being good enough, or panicking about how I might end up homeless, not get a job, live a horrible life (and others like it). Just like I have no real control, no one can save me and I'll be on my own, fending for myself soon (am 19, applying for uni).

I feel very lonely, and nostalgic in a way. Like I wish someone would just tell me things will be ok - like in a way that a parent would to a kid: no real answers, no logic, just a hug and knowing they're there.

Am I just super lonely? I never feel like this (or to this extent) any other time in the day, most days. Just the evenings - and even then, it's not a super common occurrence.",Anxiety
"Hi guys,

So for almost the past month, my anxiety has randomly increased about tenfold. Since 2018, Iâ€™ve struggled with panic attacks (not frequent) and intrusive thoughts. Nonetheless, I was still a very social person and could go about my daily life perfectly fine. 

Now, since January 15th, I canâ€™t leave the house without having panic attacks or derealization episodes. This has turned me into a depressed, anxious mess. I havenâ€™t felt calm or in control since.

I tried to start therapy, but the place I went to had a waiting list of 4-5 months and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m capable of living like this for that long- so I saw my primary care doctor, and she prescribed me Zoloft 25mg and Xanax 0.25mg. 

My mom takes Zoloft for GAD and loves it (she has been on it for a very long time), but I know that medication is trial and error for everyone and I am worried about a few things. One, Iâ€™m worried that the meds will make my anxiety worse and Iâ€™m not sure if I can mentally handle that right now. Two, Iâ€™m worried I wonâ€™t feel like myself. And three, Iâ€™m worried that my anxiety is actually *that* bad and Iâ€™m just convincing myself that it is and I donâ€™t actually need to take medication. 

Iâ€™m supposed to take my first dose (12.5mg of Zoloft for a few days, then increase to 25mg) today and Iâ€™m very anxious.

Just looking for some success stories or some motivation. Thanks guys, and I hope everyoneâ€™s doing well.",Anxiety
"I always wake up several times a night and get up at 8 in the morning feeling well rested. Throughout the day i always start to feel more and more dizzy untill the room is spinning and i sometimes can jo longer stand. Sometimes I get a rapid heart rate and feel a flair of panic but it often dies down very quickly.

When I take Serax the heart rate and anxiety completely go away, but the dizziness keeps persisting and only lessens a little bit in intensity. Since i am dizzy for hours before I start to worry about it i think that it may be the Serax causing it (withdrawal) or I may have another condition that that causes me to be dizzy like an inner ear infection.

In my eyes it is the dizziness and ballance problems that make me anxious and not the anxiety that makes me dizzy and off ballance, especially since the Serax doesn't cure my dizziness but does cure the anxiety i have about it. I could be wrong of course, I am open to a different view.

"When I was 5 or 6 I went to the only dentist in this small town with my mom to get a cleaning, xrays, and that stupid fluoride thing that foams in your mouth.

The only memory I have of this appointment is when I got uncomfortable with the foaming fluoride and tried to spit it out, and the male dentist then put his hand over my mouth and held me down. (he's now retired from dentistry) 

I've spend 23 years getting over that trauma, I had 5 fillings, braces, and 2 crowns, all went fine with a couple minor panic attacks that blew over quickly.

Today I went in to get a small filling, everything was going fine but the dental student, I explain my anxiety and phobia at every appointment and she was amazing. The lidocaine wasn't working so they opted for a different anesthetic that was in this huge gun like syringe and the male dentist who is the instructor decided to show the student how this anesthetic works, except he explained nothing to me and it was only a minute and a half but it felt like an eternity, I panicked once I tasted and felt fluid going to the back of my throat. My eyes were wide and I made noise and gestures to stop, he did not, I moved my arms and this man held me down and the panic attack went into full force, crying, thrashing, fight or flight kicks in. He started yelling at me as I'm crying in the middle of a panic attack. Instead of removing the needle and just doing it one more time after I had used the suction, he held me down for 15 seconds yelling at me.

The student apologized repeated once the dentist left saying he was ""old school"".

I struggle with sleeping and when I do sleep I wake up in the middle of the night from nightmares about my life falling apart.

It feels like something pierces my heart and then it sinks down to my fingers while suffocating me. Due to COVID, my country has banned all flights from the UK so I cannot go back and I have no family here. I feel like a failure and that I'm falling behind my friends because they are all in  well-paid jobs in business and finance while my job in public healthcare is badly paid in comparison.

I'm so scared of having to make such big decisions now and I'm so worried that I'll regret one of these decisions.

"Hello, I don't know if this is the proper place to ask for help but I'm running out of hope that I will one day get over this.

"I've never been formally diagnosed with anxiety - but I'd say I feel anxious 95% of the time. Unfortunately, fear takes the drivers seat 9/10x. Certain situations amp it up more, usually in a social setting. I started a new job, I've been there for less than six months. My bosses daughter recently got engaged and he invited me - I politely let him know I will not be attending. I know he probably sent the invitation because ""he had to"" type of thing, but so many people advised me to let him know I'm not attending so I did. However, the anxiety and guilt I sent while crafting my ""will not be attending"" text was overwhelming. After I sent the message, I had to not look at my phone for the next hour or so in fear that I would receive a disappointed text back (even though in my head, I knew/know he could care less if I came or not). I know I'm not important to him and I probably never cross his mind unless it's work related, but I still have this insane fear of disappointing him. We're not close, I barely know him, he barely knows me. My job is not dependent on being there for him/his family or not, yet somehow I still have such anxious thoughts around disappointing him by not showing up/being available.

I had to get checked out by doctors at my apartment because I was certain I was going to die and pass out. I didnâ€™t go into the ER because I am terrified of COVID.

"Hey everyone,

I have been struggling with anxity almost as long as I remember, I can only think about some memories when I was like 5-7 and was happy, but not many.

I have anxity and ocd which realy isnt a good mix.

For like 2 years ago I started getting affraid of everything, it started one day when I felt i couldnt breath but It was just my anxity tricking me. Today I still have this feeling sometimes if I think to much of it. But as the years have gone by, ive started to be affraid of other things. Chocking on food, killing somone else, me dying or someone I know and other things.
Its different things and like i month ago I was affraid I was going to hurt other people, but I know Im not that person and I also know i would never do something like that. I just get so sad and a wierd bad feeling everytime I think about it also cuz I know it isnt me.
This month its another thing. Now Im affraid of acting or being gay. I know im not gay and ive never been interested in guys or getting feeling from then before so that isnt me. 
I feel like its just my anxity that playing with me and making me think all of this. What do you guys think and do you have any ideas on what to do?

Thanks everyone.",Anxiety

"I (24F) had panic attacks since I was 13, the first six years were really hard, my heart was beating super fast, my body used to shake so much that my boyfriend had to get on top of me and hold me so I wouldn't get hurt. I also get a stomachache so bad it made me vomit all the time (which led to bulimia) and I always wanted to go to the bathroom for number 2.

Many people say that when they have panic attacks they fear dying. What I feel is my heart beating incredibly fast which makes me feel like there are very heavy currents/chains pulling my heart down which makes me gasp for air. The feeling is so strong that I often asked to die, just to stop feeling it. It's in those moments (which in my case can last about 2 hours) that i fell like i lost control of my own body.

Today I am much better, I know almost everything that triggers me and what to do when it happens. Sometimes I still have them, but I can't even compare them to the ones in the beginning. ( the feeling of being pulled down stayed as well as the urge to go to the bathroom. In the other hand I managed to stop vomiting after 8 years).
I started therapy and medication when I was 13 and continue to this day.

I know panic attacks manifest in different ways, I'm just curious about what other people feel when they experience them.

"I need to tell a little background story before I digg into the core of my problem. I hope you stay patient with me, and read it all.
I never thought I had to ask for advice in a forum as an adult woman in my 30's, but here I am. 

I used to be ""the ugly duckling"" growing up, and I was bullied alot. When I passed 25 things changed drastically. I lost a lot of weight and by the time I turned 30, I was better looking then I had ever been in my whole life. I had a lot of male friends for many years. It was easier, cause they spoked their minds and I always knew where I stood and what to expect from them. It was just easy and uncomplicated. 
When my looks changed, this became a huge problem. I couldn't have male friends anymore, cause no matter what i did, they ended up falling for me, and they got hurt. I hate hurting people.

I moved to the same street my mum lives in about 6 months ago. Prior to this I visited her now and then, and It came to my attention that the guys working at the pharmasy where she lives is very good looking. They run a family business, so most of the people working there, is family. When I came there before I moved, they were all nice and even on the edge to flirty sometimes. 

I have to go to the pharmacy 3 times a week due to a medical condition after several surgeries gone bad.(acute surgeries in my guts which has made my guts pretty toasted.) This pharmasy is the only pharmasy close to us. It's a long way to the next one. 

BACKGROUND TOLD, LET'S DIGG IN:

When I started to use the pharmasy as my regular go-to pharmasy, everything worked fine. They all acted nicely, but after they knew I moved, it was a little strange atmosphere when I was there. Two of them particularly  was acting very flirty. (I think they're brothers, but I'm not 100% sure.) I've started to be quite good to recognize flirting over the years. It was almost like a competition between these two for my attention when I came in. It's very hard to explain.
I'm flirty by nature, but I never put any ""game"" to it, if that makes sense. One of the guys started to stand out more and more, and I found him very attractive.  
I always thought it was very nice to go to the pharmasy, cause it always made me feel good walking out of there. It was a nice way to start my day. I miss those days.
One time, when I was at the counter with the one I found most attractive, -let's call him Moss, a good looking male family member my age came in and stood by me and talked to me.(they had never seen him before) Moss froze and started acting very weird and even had to leave the counter and give my order to someone else. He looked really shooken up. He walked to the back of the store where Noone could see him.
Moss always used my name several times every time he took my order. (My mum has used the pharmasy for years and knows the place very well. Better then me, but not once have I heard him say her name.)
The last month before the bad shit that happened, Moss was pretty much the only one taking my orders.

SO TO WHERE THINGS WHENT STRAIGHT TO H**L:

One night at home, I was having some anxiety, and I hadn't slept for days. I have this now and then, and usually just take a pill and go to sleep,and everything's better in the morning.
But I was out of my meds, so I asked my mum to borrow from her.(she also has anxiety now and then.)
She didn't have the one I used, but she had something similar. I was sleeping at my mums house that day.
I took the pill, and whent to sleep -or so I thought....
Next day when I ""woke up"" my mum told me that the pill had made me react very badly. Instead of getting tired and go to sleep, I got very energic and didn't sleep at all! She told me I had these weird ideas and I was just not myself at all. I found out that i had a 16 hour blackout window!!
I got really worried and checked my phone. Oh.my.God.. 
I had written so many texts that I would never in a million years write!!  I saw replies to things I would never ever talk about,say, or even think!
I started checking my apps and... yeah you guessed it.
I texted Moss.ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸
I freaked out completely and only saw the first sentence of the message and that he had read it before I deleted it. I was in panic mode!!
The ony sentence I saw before deleting was: hey Moss! I hope you don't find this unapproapiate....
And that's it.
I wrote an apology to him saying I never ment to text him, and that I would try to avoid the pharmacy in the future. That I would never text him again.  I also told him I had a blackout due to reaction from an anxiety pill my mum gave me, and that I had no idea what I had written to him, and that I preferred to never know. I finished saying I hoped he some day could laugh of it and find it flatteting that I thought if him duing a blackout, but that I didn't mean to do this, and that I hoped we could just put it behind us.
He never responded to either texts, but he read them both.

I sendt my mum to the pharmasy the first week.
Then I got mad because he at least could have told me that it was nothing to worry about, and just stay professional, so I desided to go back, cause I knew I eventually had to. At the time I texted him I didn't know that the next pharmacy was that far away, but once I realised, I knew I just had to ""woman up"" and go back.

The first days I whent back was a fucking nightmare. I felt like All but 1 of them was avoiding me and not looking me in the eyes. I wasn't really looking much at them either tbh. I was just trying to cope with myself. I saw Moss the first couple days I was there but he was keeping a distance.
After this I didn't see him. Took me a while to realize that he was actually hiding!! Yes.. he was f*****g hiding. The way I realised this was that he was out on the floor in the pharmacy one time I came, but when he saw me he froze and ran to hide I'm the back of the pharmacy. 
This kept going for 2 weeks. I saw him run away several times.
I wish he'd just act like nothing happened but stayed professional.  It would have made things alot easier on me.
I'll admit that I was extremely uncomfortable going in, and it was probably written all over my face from day 1.
After 2 weeks I started to feal comfortable again cause I didn't really have to deal with him, and the others was acting nice again. Things whent back to normal Ã·Moss.
But just as I started getting comfortable, the snake crawled out from hiding. He started circling around me, looking at me and glancing at me when I wasn't looking, but I could see it in the corner of my eyes. 
Then he started looking at Me when I looked at him, but only a few seconds before I looked away.
Them he started smiling at me, and I smiled back. After this, he said hi and smiled, and I did the same. 
So far so good. Right?
No.
I was freaking out a little every single time.
I wasn't ready to confront him or going to his counter.
After he ""came out from hiding, I had avoided it 3 times already. He was clearly trying to get me to his counter.(they were always 2 in the counters. If Moss had a customer but the other didn't, I whent straight to the one who didn't have a coustomer. When Moss didn't have a customer I walked around looking in the store before taking a ticket when i saw another customer go to Moss, and was called to the other counter etc. I was avoiding him cause I still felt so ashamed about the message.
I honestly thought about avoiding him for the rest of my life ðŸ™ˆ
3 days of avoidance and I was forced into a corner.
And that made me make a total idiot of myself. Again.
I didn't have a choise. 
I whent to the pharmacy to pick up my order, but Moss was the only one sitting in a counter. The other one stood a little behind him just observing the situation, but he had no intentions of helping me. 
They knew exactly the time I came, so it was easy to predict. (I always pick up my order at 9 am)
As I walked in I froze.  Just a little. I looked around, observing the situation, but Moss called out for me. He told me to come to his counter.
I didn't really have much of I choise without looking like an idiot.
I could feal my heart rising. I was fucking terrified!! But I desided that I needed to do this and just get it overwith. 
I walked up to him and started telling him what I was there to pick up, but my voice sounded so damn dry. My mouth was a desert and I could hear that he heard it. I was having a hard time to speak. He was smiling, but acting a little flirty but weird, while i was building up to a f****ng panick attack! In his counter!ðŸ¤¯
He was acting strange. I saw he was struggling aswell, just repeating exactly what I said over and over, not able to look at me for long at the time.  If that was because I was struggling or if he had his own issues I'm not sure.
My heart raised so fast. My mouth was dry. I started having big problems breathing. I got dizzy.. thoughts rasing through my head. I had to leave... I had to just tell him I couldn't do this and walk away. That - or faint on the floor of his store...ðŸ˜³
I swear he could hear this panic breathing. I turned away, just facing sideways with my face towards the exit, trying to get control of my betraying body.
It took about 2 minutes, and then I managed to remember to breath deeply and I managed to get control. I was able to act completely normally after this and smiled when I walked away, but I felt like a disaster. 
After ignoring him for weeks I got an anxiety attack infront of him!!? 
I've worked at moving on from making a fool out of myself only to make a fool out of myselfðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸

This is as far as this story goes. 

What I need help with is figuring out how to deal with this situation, with my anxiety, but also get some thoughts about what's going on in his head.
Cause I don't get it.
Why was he hiding??
Why is HE acting weird? 
Why was he unable to act professional?
And why us he struggling now? Is my bodylanguage enough to throw him off?
What's going on here??
It's damn comfusing and I just need this to be ok again so that I don't have to feal this bad every time I go there and for hours after. 

I appreciate any advice on how to handle myself and ideas you might have to why he's acting this way, cause it makes no sense to me.

Thank you for reading to the end!

"Iâ€™ve always had anxiety but it was a bit more school centric and social centric then anything else. Lately I feel like other areas in my life are started to be impacted, especially since covid. 

At 17/18 I was still excited about trying new things, I was fairly able to overcome my anxiousness and just go for it, I wanted to do new things, a summer abroad seemed fun. Now I just donâ€™t feel that anymore. 

Iâ€™m tired and sleepy and dont wanna go anywhere. I mean I do sometimes but then Iâ€™m like I donâ€™t have the energy. I donâ€™t wanna go out anymore at all bc of covid (double vaxxed so far) but itâ€™s like I also just donâ€™t wanna exist? I kind of just wanna lay around and be alone but I donâ€™t even like being that alone.

Family fights a lot prolly bc always around each other now and I know itâ€™s not unhealthy to like at least look forward to the next steps in life? I canâ€™t do that anymore, itâ€™s like I donâ€™t want to move forward anymore. I donâ€™t want anything to really change, and itâ€™s like I just want to stay around my parents because thatâ€™s my way of thinking nothing bad will happen. Hell I donâ€™t even defend myself anymore, I love my parents but theyâ€™re not the nicest sometimes but I just think I should suck it up and be nice bc what if I hurt their feelings or something happens and I regret it? Every night i come up with the worst scenarios and lowkey cry myself to sleep, very bothersome.

I get irritated over stupid shit but then lose the energy to acc act on it half way through. lWhy am I even so tired? 

Iâ€™ve always not really took well to change but itâ€™s really amplified now .if I leave the house sometimes Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll die (this one is very uncommon though). school stresses me out but I procrastinate and end up stressing out even more. 

I mentioned like a little bit of this to a friend and they said it sucks but I have to try harder to change, essentially that itâ€™s up to me. I know theyâ€™re right but itâ€™s really difficult? I felt shitty bc I guess it is in my control to some extent but doesnâ€™t really feel that way.

"I've made this similar post elsewhere but never thought about asking it here so here I go.

I have social anxiety disorder/generalized anxiety disorder and severe depression. I have had these things for years but noticable signs of my mental illnesses started in elementary school. I didn't really talk and I honestly don't think I even felt anything, maybe loneliness but other than that I remember being my myself most of the time just feeling blank. I believe now that was my way of coping with what I didn't understand was anxiety. No one talked to me so I never said anything and in away I feared socializing.
 As I grew older these feelings became more prevalent, literally spiralling into depression and me being so anxious I avoided school as much as possible. I battled with these feeling of normalcy and didn't understand why I couldn't control these things about myself..
I can honestly say it wasn't until my young adulthood where I felt like I actually CARED about my well-being. I started thinking of more healthy ways to deal with my anxiety and telling myself I deserve to get better. Also, I started focusing on positive things I knew would bring me joy.

I've made alot of approvements and can honestly say Ive come a long way... One of the things I've been doing to improve my mental health is getting a job. I have decided Amazon is the place Ill like to work. The pay is nice and and I actually feel less anxious working there out of all my jobs Ive had. I had a plan set for myself to work as a packer as Amazon because I felt like that specific job position was comfortable for me and it gave me a sense of accomplishment. I could just stay in my little station and to on my packages with minimal human interaction. 
Also, I've been working on getting disability accommodations for work because I heard people with similar illnesses as me say they been able to get it. 

Unfortunately, I don't have a primary doctor and my appointments are scheduled so far back it takes time. All my medical history is outdated, so I have to start at square one get a referral to see a physciarist then I have to go back to a doctor to approve of my accommodations. It's kinda discouraging to know you suffer with something but have to jump thru hoops to prove it but I guess I understand why...does anyone else have a similar situation as me and have any advice for therapy?

"TW: Please don't read if you are in a bad place. Su*cide, murd*r, violence TW.  21F. So about 7 months ago i was depressed. At my all time low. Maybe even suicidal. It was a second wave of COVID that time so we were all on lockdown. However one day my friends and i met up. I was actually kind of happy that day. After meeting them. Had fun. Now while going home i begged one of my friend to let me drive his car just for a while. Mind you I am a terrible driver and i had never driven in the dark. It was Twilight. He gave me his car key. I was surprised. While going to the car or before i asked him to drive, (i can't remember) i kept getting these bad and sad thoughts about how once i go home i will get bad thoughts again and i kept getting suicidal thoughts. However i ignored them and well my friends and i went in the car and i tried to drive them. It was a fail. I couldn't drive at all. I drove v slow and i kept screaming and turned on the wrong side of the road that i gave the car back lmao. I went home and laughed at this incident. It became a joke. I told my friend about how i had never driven in the dark and that's why it was so bad. However half a month later i got this idea that maybe i begged to drive because i was suicidal. I mean sure i had intentionally taking more risks because i didn't care if i died or not. But that shouldn't count as a suicide and murder attempt right? Idk what to do.
Edit: i just found a text where i told my friends the day before this incident that i have started indulging in risky behaviour. Driving his car was one of it. I feel horrible for endangering my friends. I couldn't drive and hadn't driven for months but i told my friend i could. I don't know if this is a connection i am simply making or what. Please help me. It became a joke and i was laughed at. But does it count as attempted murder?",Anxiety
"The entire industry Iâ€™m in transitioned to work from home due to corona, right before I got my job. Itâ€™s sort of the norm in the industry now. This made my social anxiety, which was bad but not terrible, skyrocket. I can easily go 2 weeks without leaving my apartment complex with grocery delivery. The isolation slowly made my anxiety increase more and more, and as a result I started visiting with friends and family less.

So now when I see my family, they know that I havenâ€™t been around as much lately, which they probably think is odd. But I just say Iâ€™m busy with work, as I had transitioned from college to school since this started happening.

The issue is that as I hang out with them, itâ€™s like my social anxiety slowly grows larger and larger. To the point where after 2 hours of socialization, I am visibly extremely anxious. I am fidgeting quite a lot, I am tapping my feet, zoning out in my head, probably have wide eyes and an uncomfortable look on my face, etc. I can sense that my family members are looking at me with confused/concerned looks, which obviously makes it much much worse. 

My mom asked me why Iâ€™ve been acting so strange, and I told her I have severe social anxiety that is getting worse, but she just kind of looks at me like she doesnâ€™t know if Iâ€™m being genuine.

"I've recently been wondering if Sensory Overload can be very selective, and be a symptom of Anxiety? I generally don't really struggle with Sensory Overload, but then there are some things that seem like Sensory Overload to me which cause quite bad reactions.

For instance, when I'm in a room with somebody on, let's say, TikTok, and they're playing a different video every 5-10 seconds; even worse if there's already music or a video going in the background, it makes me feel like I'm going feral. I've had to remove myself from a situation like that before to cry in the shower from how overwhelmed I felt. I really hate rapidly changing sound like that, but generally don't mind any other noises more than anyone. But those specific instances really drive me insane, I sweat, I feel trapped, I get super agitated... I genuinely cannot handle it.

Similarly I've been wondering if I get physical sensory overload, e.g. I have a hard time staying really still, I'm usually just gently moving a foot or something while I sit or lay. I've mostly noticed it because my partner (who can sit very still) pointed out how I'm never still, and when we cuddle in bed I can feel really uncomfortable if I don't move a tiny bit sometimes and I become hyperaware of it as I don't want to annoy him. It makes me feel like the inside of my body is itchy if I don't move every now and then though and I eventually can't focus on anything else.

Anybody know if this does count as sensory overload considering I'm mostly aware of these two things? Just the severity of my reactions makes me wonder what's up with that, and if it's related to my General Anxiety.",Anxiety
"Hey everyone

Currently i'm struggling a lot.I am unable to do mistakes because i have such a fear of getting negative reactions. So i either avoid any situation where i COULD make a mistake or when a situation happens i'm like ""I will never do x again then because i can't see myself improve on tasks"".
I feel like a idiot. I'm  always thinking about the past, these memories always come back. I can't accept that i can't be 100% perfect and never forgive myself for doing things not the way i intend to. Everytime i fuck up i feel the need to be punished, sometimes physically (i got hit as a child by my father).
I'm looking back so much that i'm not living in the present and i can't see any future for myself. I do have some dreams but they feel like as if kids talk about what they want to be when they grow up.

It's been a huge change in my lifestyle, from hiding at home avoiding conflict to having the balls to go alone to that gym. After the first two days my anxiety was ""controlled"". I wasn't in fear of the ""what if..."" anymore.

Everything went downhill only a few days before, when I started thinking about my new routine. It's always when I'm about to sleep. I notice my heart rate and the beats are too fast. It feels like it's hitting my chest. I shake a little and feel really cold. Then I feel that I can't breathe but I do try to remind myself to take a deep breath and calm down. I listen to ASMR to relax but I can't go on with this happening every night. Right now it's 8am and I couldn't sleep yet... during the day I constantly cry out of nowhere. They say exercise is good for this and I do feel great after the gym but at night, that's other story. 

I'm also terrified of taking any medication. No one knows about my anxiety and I feel that people won't take me seriously anymore if they know I'm medicated. Even doctors won't take me seriously anymore if they know. Sadly it is like this in my country for anything related to mental health.",Anxiety

Hey!

Iâ€™m active with soccer practice and have an important soccer practice tomorrow thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m worried.

I have a hard time with a runny nose due to allergies. Tried a nasal spray called Otrivin yesterday, the strongest one. I took it 2 times in each and and 30 minuter later my throat started to burn. Can this be due to the Nasal spray? I was sick with covid 2 weeks ago but I dont think it has anything to do with this. I've always had a runny nose due to allergies and decided to try nasal spray out. 

I doubt itâ€™s a virus as Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ve felt the same thing before with another nasal spray. Itâ€™s been a day now but itâ€™s better than it was yesterday. Again, I was also sick 2 weeks ago so I doubt Iâ€™m sick again.",Anxiety

"Ok, so I'm in between jobs at the moment because my last job wasn't the right fit for me. Two weeks ago I had a job interview which went great. I was very nervous before hand, but during the interview I was ok. It was only 50 minutes so I new I would be over before I knew it. I have the tendency to sweat a lot and I stink most of the time afterwards because of my axienty, so this time was not any different. Anyway, I got the job and I have a great feeling about it. We set the day to start on the 15th of February. I thought this would be a regular workday, but a couple of days later they emailed me that it was a great way to get to know everyone because it's a teamday. I always hated days like this.. I always get so, so nervous. My belly aches and I have to go to the toilet countless times. I sweat and I stink if I don't wear the right clothes. 

This morning I rechieved the program of the day which starts at 9 and ends at 5. SO LONG. We have to wear comfy clothes, because we are going to move ugh, whatever that means. They are presenting something which I hate because it makes me extra nervous because I have the feeling that it is not socially desirable to stand up and leave. People expect you to stay and listen. So it triggers my axienty. Most of the time I get bellyaches, I start shaking and I have to go to the restroom. People don't notice my pannicy moments. 

But the worst part of the program is that we have an activity described as 'something completly different' and I don't know what it is. It is repetitive so we have to do this like three times.. I really don't like to be suprised. 

I have bellyaches already.. What would you do? Just go and suffer? Tell them how you feel and go? Or tell them about my axienty and say you prefer an other moment the start the job? I don't know. Help. FWI, I'm in therapy and I will talk about it Monday with my group. But that is like in three days and I had to vent.

"I (24y/o) am writing this to share my experiences with SSRIs and benzodiazepines as an adolescence. I also want to mention beforehand that I am in no way attempting to disparage antidepressants or those who rely on them to help cope with a mental health disorder. 

When I was 9 years old I was prescribed Vyvanse for ADHD. I have always been a very energetic person. Even in my mid 20s I find it hard to stay still for long, and often experience an ""overactive"" mind.  I was formally diagnosed with a panic disorder when I was 12 years old, however I remember having my first panic attack when I was 7. Around 8th grade is when they became less sporadic and my parents who at this time had been seperated for a decade, decided to put me on antidepressants. I was prescribed a low dose of Xanax for panic attack at school, and Zoloft on a daily basis. I only took Xanax for about a month before I saw an episode of ""Intervention"" in which a woman was addicted to the medication, leading me to refuse taking it. I was promptly put on Klonipin, though my anxiety and panic attacks persisted. By the middle of 8th grade I could hardly complete a full day of school without having a panic attack and breaking down. Growing up I was bullied in school, but it never affected me to such a degree. It was more of a nuisance than anything else. I wonder if my panic disorder stems from my parents' custody battle and abuse at home and my lack of feeling in control. At this point it was hard to even go places I loved going to. Bowling alleys, skating rinks, parks, malls, anywhere I went I risked having a panic attack and feeling like I was going to die. 

Going into highschool I was put on Paxil. The panic attacks didn't go away. I only spent a total of two months in a public highschool setting before enrolling in virtual schooling. My mother had my psychiatrist try Effexor, Wellbutrin, Vistaril, then back to the Zoloft/Klonipin regimine. Throughout all of this I felt little emotion. I believe the clinical term is emotional blunting or apathy. I hardly laughed, never cried, didn't want friends. I didn't have a ""highschool experience"". No prom or homecoming. No cute first date with a crush. No football games or any of that junk. The strange thing about all of this is when I finally took myself off the pills when I turned 19, I hardly had any memories between the ages of 13-18. When I think back to my childhood all I can remember are things that happened from 2-12. I can decribe a tree in the front yard of my house in 2005, but couldn't begin to tell you what my first time driving a car was like. Looking back on those 5 years is like looking through a dense fog. 

I wish my parents would have worked harder at getting along. I wish they would have given my CBT more of a chance. I feel like I lost so much in those few years that I'm never going to get back. Those pills made me a weird, lifeless person. Now that I am free of them I finally feel what it was like to live all those years ago, before the fog took me. 

Again, this post isn't intended to vilify antidepressants or shame anyone who takes them. This is my own experience and everyone's brain is different. There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to medication for mental health.",Anxiety

"Hello,

A few months ago I was on snapchat. On my reccomended froends (not sure the correct term as I didn't use snapchat much) there was an account with a profile picture of woman in her early 20s. However when I clicked on their snapchat story they were openly showing and selling CP.

I immediately reported to snapchat and the relevant authorities that deal with this sort of thing in my country. I hope to fuck they caught that sick bastard or hopefully they've since died a horrid death.

The thing is the image has traumatised me so much. My entire life I've dealt with anxiety and intrusive thoughts but these months have been hell. For weeks afterwards I would burst into tears everytime it came into my head (I'm a grown man). Its affected me so badly that I'm doing really stupid things. 

For example, a few months afterwards  I called the police and reported an ad online cos I thought it was a child being trafficked. I called the cops back to check for an update and they said there was no criminality established.  Just in my paranoia, all stemming from the snapchat story, I thought it was something way worse than what it was.

I'm practically an alcoholic and drug addict cos of it. My anxiety and OCD has been the worst in years.

 I know I did the right thing and reported it (I also donate to an organisation that removes this stuff from the internet) but I can't help but feel I didnt do enough. I sit and beat myself up about it all the time. I feel as though it's my own fault for stumbling across it even though i had no intention of viewing something so evil.

All I want is for that poor kid to be safe. I can't stop seeing their face in my mind

Feel like I can't cope anymore. The embarrassment of calling the cops over nothing and the the horror of what I saw is all too much. I feel as though it'll be a black cloud following me forever. I feel so stupid.

If someone could just talk to me, that'd be great.",Anxiety

"I am a 20F and I have always has this really terrible fear of death. Since I was small, the times that I saw death have impacted me so much that I have full blown anxiety attacks. The thought of death being so... abrupt. My mind cannot wrap around the fact that no one knows what happens after. I go on to have sleepless nights crying and hoping that I will remember my life and that somehow a part of me will still live on whether it's a soul/ghost. Recently, I opened up to my boyfriend about my fear and told me he has had that feeling but that he embraced it to the point where he finds the end calming. Even writing this right now is making me cry out of desperation and confusion. 


I know death is something I cannot control. I know that it will happen eventually. I know that I am way too young to be thinking about this. However, no matter how much I try to come to terms with it i just can't. I don't understand it. Every time I have an experience that is either life changing or just so positive and memorable, it reminds me of how there is a high possibility that it will all be gone and I will disappear. I don't care if people remember me. I care about my life, my experiences, my memories. I want to always remember the feeling of touching my s/o's skin and the way it felt to be hugged.

"TW: health conditions, covid vaccine, side effects

Let me start this by saying Iâ€™m not an antivaxxer by any means. I hate all the conspiracy theories and conservative mumbo jumbo, I think itâ€™s idiotic and dangerous. Iâ€™m also a leftist and have tons of compassion for people (if not too much). Iâ€™ve worn a mask since the start of the pandemic, I social distance whenever possible, I test myself, etc. 

But hereâ€™s the thing: I have really bad anxiety and also a complicated medical history. I have 3 autoimmune conditions that I know of (2 are officially diagnosed and could have fairly serious consequences if they progress or if I have too much inflammation in my body), meaning Iâ€™m also highly susceptible to developing more for seemingly any reason. And Iâ€™ve heard of people getting autoimmune conditions from the vaccine. I also have sensitivities to gluten/wheat, sugar, and dairy and Iâ€™m prone to flare ups, sometimes for the dumbest reasons (extremely sore wrists and painful joints from texting too much or accidentally eating a small amount of gluten, for example). Iâ€™ve also had a swollen lymph node in my neck since last September so an ENT recommended I get an MRI at some point soon. I have pretty severe health anxiety, depression, and other issues on top of all that including tinnitus (which Iâ€™ve heard the vaccine often causes to worsen). 

So I have a lot going for me lol. And seeing as there arenâ€™t any long term studies on people with my issues receiving the covid vaccine, Iâ€™m hesitant to get it. I know the CDC says itâ€™s safe for now and I believe them, but they simply donâ€™t know the long term effects. None of us do. And I canâ€™t afford to have a bad reaction to the vaccine when I just started working again or possibly develop another autoimmune condition (like lupus) that could kill me or cause severe lifelong problems. I know covid carries risks that are far greater but Iâ€™m pretty sure I got infected with the worst strain in early 2020 (didnâ€™t think it was possible at the time bc there were no known cases in my state yet) and yet I recovered alone in 5-7 days total with no severe side effects that I know of. 

Plus knowing that omicron is spreading fast even amongst vaccinated people makes me even more hesitant. 

But the current attitude seems to be that all unvaxxed people are selfish and disgusting, but I wouldnâ€™t be unvaxxed if I didnâ€™t have legitimate reasons. I wouldâ€™ve gotten it right away if I didnâ€™t have any health conditions or health anxiety :/ I do think the people who refuse to get it bc theyâ€™re conservative Christians or simply bc they donâ€™t care about protecting others are absolutely selfish. Thereâ€™s no doubt about that. 
But I just genuinely donâ€™t know how my body will react to it, especially since itâ€™s likely weâ€™ll have to get boosters every few months for it to be effective so that means immune reactions (and potential bad reactions) every few months for god knows how long. 

But I still feel like a shit person for being scared of getting the vaccine. Iâ€™ve made 3 appointments in the last year and cancelled them all at the last minute. I also feel like shit for debating whether or not to tell new people, especially before first dates. They might think Iâ€™m a terrible selfish person and not even give me the chance to explain, but donâ€™t they have a right to know? They may have loved ones who are immunocompromised so itâ€™s within their right to have a boundary about vaccines even if someone tests negative.

"So, I did AWOL and LOA last year and this semester should be my last (since max residency and all that).

I honestly can't handle applications and asking people for help. It's not really about me being stumped, I know what needs to be done. It's more of freezing up and being incapable of handling paperwork and shaking and I really should breathe now.

My brother's gf messaged me last night about how she hasn't seen my enrollment yet (she works at the university I study) and that message honestly made me go into one of my worst panic attacks. I locked my door and just laid down on the floor and cried while hugging a stuff toy. It wasn't the bawl-your-eyes-out cry. It's more of the silent tears where you already know you're useless and nothing is gonna make your situation better. That type of intense emotion due to resignation towards life. 

Just now, my brother called me (this is out of character; he's so busy and he mostly messages and never calls). He didn't reprimand me why I haven't done the re-enrollment. He just said that he'll message me the required paperwork, even made me a numbered list of tasks to do. He emphasized how I just need to ask for help if I need it. I didn't expect that. 

And..! Guess what, everyone? I actually messaged my university in how I should handle my reapplication!

I was at the front desk to sign in the class, at first I was nervous then I began to hyperventilate. A lot of fears came to mind, so I walked outside. I was softly crying about the situation and was afraid my anxiety would cause me to drop out of class.

Suddenly I asked myself â€œIs giving up on my life goal worth avoiding a few seconds of conflict from a stranger I'll see once in a lifetime?â€ I can't give up then continue to imagine being strong. I will be strong even if it scares me. 

I went back to the fitness center, signed in, and asked for help on the equipment. The trainer is a nice guy, I was extremely awkward but he looked past it and I did 30 minutes of exercise. I feel better and hopefully, work out longer tomorrow.",Anxiety
"I've had a long standing fear of the dentist. A few bad experiences combined with guilt about not looking after my teeth has made my dental health a nightmare.

I have a great dentist who is so gentle and kind that I no longer need valium or even anaesthetic when I see her. She's extraordinary.

Unfortunately, six months ago I found out I need a wisdom tooth taken out. This is a pretty basic procedure that COULD be done in the chair but when I saw the surgeon he said that my anxiety and my tic disorder meant I should really get a general anaesthetic.

Months went by I couldn't get an appointment. He was booked up, I was too anxious or too busy, and my city went in and out of lockdown.

Last week, my tooth finally started to hurt. It was so painful that I couldn't lie down and spent two nights sitting up in an armchair, unable to move my head. 

I got some antibiotics but the tooth needed to come out.

I rang the surgeon only to find he had left the country! However, his colleague agreed to see me. Because elective surgery under a general anaesthetic isn't possible due to COVID regulations, he suggested ""twilight surgery"" where I'd be technically awake but so doped up, I wouldn't care. 

I spent three days in isolation to prepare, taking multiple COVID tests. The night before, I couldn't sleep and the following morning I didn't take my ADHD medication or eat or drink my usually coffee. 

When I arrived at the clinic, I started to get more and more nervous. I spoke to the anaesthetist who explained that I'd be awake but he'd be able to tell when I was ready for surgery. 

How? I asked.

He couldn't really explain except to say that he could tell by speaking to me. (This is entirely reasonable by the way.)

The problem is, I have a tic disorder and often struggle to communicate when nervous.

He took me in to talk to the surgeon and as soon as I sat down, I start to hyperventilate, something I never do. Tears were streaming down my cheeks as I shook in total terror. 

The surgeon for the first time realised what he was dealing with and immediately cancelled the surgery and sent me home.

I'll have to go back in three weeks for surgery under a general. After seeing me in the chair, it is no longer considered ""elective"". 

Hopefully the antibiotics and painkillers will keep me sane.

Here's what I learnt:

1) In 2022, a 41 year old man can sob in the middle of a crowded hospital and be treated with nothing my warmth and kindness by people of all ages. I never felt judged or 

2) It is extraordinarily hard to describe chronic anxiety to people used to dealing with nervous and scared people all day. No matter how much I explained what I was dealing with, it wasn't until they saw with their own eyes that they understood.",Anxiety

"If this topic isn't okay for this sub, please tell me. Don't just delete, I'm having a huge panic attack right now and I need to talk, even if it's just Reddit. 



Guys. 

I just did something stupid. Like extremely stupid. 

I met this guy on a dating site. He said he was looking for a relationship, had similar interests with me, etc. I was feeling really lonely tonight, so when he said he wanted to come over to cuddle, I said yes. 

He came over, we talked a bit and seemed to get along, and then he wanted to get physical. 

He was being a dominant person, and said he wanted a video of me touching myself. 

We didn't have sex, he didn't even take any of his clothes off. But I allowed him to take the video. Literally right after, he left. 

I asked if it was for his eyes only, and he said yes...but now that he's gone, I'm freaking out. I'm so stupid. I was so starved for attention, that now it's possible he might upload a private video to a porn site. 

Or worse, try and blackmail me. 

I texted him, and he hasn't replied. He could still be driving, or maybe not. I called him. It went to voicemail. A Google voicemail. So it's not even his real number? Or do people use Google for actual numbers now? 

I could be freaking out over nothing. But I am. I hate myself right now. I just wanted to find a nice boyfriend that likes to have sex as much as I do, that I let myself be in this position. Why am I so stupid? 

Someone please tell me it's going to be okay.

We hadnâ€™t talked all day or seen each other. He gets home and I come out to say hi. Before even acknowledging me he just says 

â€œI learned a fun fact about you todayâ€ 

And I was likeâ€¦.huh? 

And then I got really anxious and nervous. And I kept asking him like 

â€œWhat did you hearâ€¦who told youâ€¦and etcâ€

And he was like â€œI canâ€™t tell youâ€ 

And I was like â€œokâ€¦well now you have to tell meâ€ 

And he was like â€œno I donâ€™tâ€

And I was like â€œplease just tell meâ€

And he was like â€œIâ€™m just jokingâ€

But it really didnâ€™t seem like he wasnâ€™t and I just KNOW if I pulled this â€œjokeâ€ on him heâ€™d be all over meâ€¦.so Iâ€™m kind of annoyed 

He kept saying he was joking but was also being likeâ€¦but maybe Iâ€™m not ðŸ˜

And I was like â€œplease just tell meâ€ 

And I was getting annoyedâ€¦because he knows Iâ€™m a really gullible person and that I have anxiety. 

Anyways we stopped talking about it and then a minute later he just nonchalantly says â€œso how was your dayâ€ 

And I was like â€œâ€¦.fineâ€ 

And then he said â€œwell you seem annoyed so Iâ€™m not gonna talk to youâ€

And then I said â€œwell you did make it awkward, I mean I did too butâ€¦.â€

"Tonight has been utterly horrible.  My mom and I attend Krav Maga downtown and were in the middle of lessons when a homeless man approached the door.  He just stood there being a complete creep.  My mom loves the homeless because her brother was, but I canâ€™t stand them.  My father, who is a police officer, was on a call where a homeless man stabbed an older lady in broad daylight for not giving him money.  

From then on, Iâ€™ve been extremely scared of them and because many of them are mentally unstable, they are unpredictable.  Back to tonight, an old homeless lady approached the building and started speaking loudly in German.  Fortunately, the instructors scared her away.  The homeless man from earlier began approaching again and would not leave.

At this point, my mind began racing a million miles per hour going down the rabbit hole of dangerous outcomes that could result.  At that moment, I started sobbing loudly and professing my hate for the homeless.  The instructors were supportive, but my mother was embarrassed and thinks of me as a disgrace because of my behavior.  She says that if I canâ€™t control my emotions, we are dropping the class.  She calls me an emotionless bitch most of the time too.

My mother then wanted to stay to record the instructors practicing the moves.  Even though, I try to add it her during class because sheâ€™s always goofing off.

The homeless man began approaching again and i just lost it.  I wanted the instructor to walk us out to our car.  My mom said thatâ€™s not necessary and Iâ€™m a foul child.  In the end, the I structor walked us to our car and my mom screamed at me for the rest of the drive home.",Anxiety
"Has anyone experienced persistent rebound anxiety after a stressful event, which occurred after a single, recreational dose of alprazolam the night prior?

Background:

I experienced a panic attack w/ SI the next day, then the following day I called out of work. My anxiety has been elevated for four and a half days.

Also, I'm struggling to discern if this was a consequence of the drug or acute/chronic stress. While not a social worker/therapist, I work with a population with a high rate of serious mental illness. Though I help folks, this type of work can be hard on me. Couple this, too, with increasing isolation since the pandemic started.

More so, I was diagnosed with GAD, 10 years ago, and I have acute panic attacks a couple times a year.

Regarding alprazolam, this was a single dose of 1mg, pharmaceutical grade. My last dose of a similar drug, etizolam, was more or less last summer. I use these substances for acute episodes and recreation, and, to avoid discontinuation symptoms and tolerance, I use them sparingly, meaning that I will wait 14 days between doses if I must and only have a few available whenever I happen to have them.

If benzodiazepines weren't taboo as they are in medicine, I would work this out with a doctor and a therapist. I'd be happy with occasional, non-refillable scrips or at least have the space to make such a request! Maybe someone out there had that in their life?

With that said, again, I'm looking for others to chime in on whether they're familiar with my experience. This has been a horrible week.",Anxiety
"I donâ€™t know how many people experience this, but I went through a period of severe anxiety and panic attacks because every time I laid down to sleep, I could feel my heart beating and it freaked me out and I couldnâ€™t sleep. I barely got any sleep for two months and I felt like my life was in shambles. But I eventually realized that if I kept movement when laying down, I wouldnâ€™t be able to feel my heart beating. And usually that movement is gently rocking when falling asleep, or kind of flexing my abdomen to move back and forth. I thought it was impossible to sleep while moving, but I guess I was wrong! This trick totally gave me back my life and I just wanted to share it in case anyone else has a similar problem./r/",Anxiety

Â â€¢Â I get really hot, my face feels like its on fire

Â â€¢Â I feel like my heart is in my throat and stutter
Â â€¢Â My muscles tense up to the point where at night they hurt alot from tension
Â â€¢Â I can't focus on anything, my mind keeps jumping from thing to thing

I just wanna be able to live a normal life without hating every minute of it. I wanna be able to get a job, not shaking while being interviewed. I wanna know what it feels like to be normal.

I'm fully aware that one of my problems is the thought that I need medication to get better. I just have been through so much therapy and I've talked about my problems, I get told I am very self aware which I agree with. Just tired of trying my ass off to use techniques I've learned in the 4-5 psych ward visits I've had and they do not help me.

"Hi! Iâ€™m not sure if this is anxious attachment or OCD, but basically I become all-consumed when someone rejects me or treats me badly. I ruminate on the rejection, talk through it, relive it. They consume so, so much of my thoughts. I obsess about what this person thinks of me, have intrusive thoughts of their life without me, visualize them having sex with others, etc. They take up so much space in my life, even if it happened 8-9 months ago. The feelings donâ€™t match the situation. The only way it stops is if I become obsessed with a NEW person. Then, Iâ€™m completely wiped of the previous obsession.

Iâ€™ve had a lot of difficulties with therapists. I tried two of them years ago while I was still a teen and they were awful. One pushed religion and the other one was inappropriate.

Finally, i got a fish tank, got a panic attack while setting it up (i wanted an aquarium to help soothe me) and now i want it gone. Water and electricity (for the heater and filter) just make me nervous. told my mom i wanted it gone, she didnâ€™t seem to care that i was anxious as hell, told my sister and she laughed at me. she apologized later but it still hurt.

"Hi! I just wanted to share my recent journey with anxiety. Iâ€™ve probably had it since I can remember. Finally, about 2 years ago I decided to see my doctor and a therapist regarding my struggles. At that point I was seriously struggling with my university classes, struggling to sleep properly, struggling to eat, and having trouble maintaining my relationship and friendships. I cried myself to sleep almost every night, worrying about dying or a loved one dying. I couldnâ€™t let my mum leave the house because I was so scared she would die in a car accident. I felt terrible. I was diagnosed by my doctor with generalized anxiety, but I decided to not medicate myself. I probably only went to therapy for a few months because I ran out of insurance coverage, but I never stopped using some of the cbt techniques I learned in that short time. Slowly itâ€™s like, I can sleep, I can eat, Iâ€™m not irrationally afraid constantly. I also struggled with anxiety in regards to talking with people I donâ€™t know well. What I did to combat that fear, I got a job at a car dealership. Iâ€™ve never looked back. Talking to people is easy now, Iâ€™m described as â€œoutgoingâ€ which was never how I pictured myself. Truly, cbt and pushing myself outside my comfort zone actually changed my life. 
Genuinely I feel like for the most part I have left my anxiety at bay. 
One thing I still struggle with is the physical symptoms of anxiety that are still there and I donâ€™t think will ever go away. Randomly, at any little sliver at stress, my entire body gets covered in red blotchy patches. Its physically noticeable. This is the last thing I hope to change.

Guess i should also mention that all my pets are with my parents so i always at least miss them after visits, but this time it feels way more than that.

This is the most intense heartbreak i have felt in my life. Just putting this out here to know if someone has been in a similar situation and knows how to feel better?,Anxiety
"He guys. New person here. Im in school at the moment and have a small part time job after school thats only 8 hours and pretty easy. I get really nervous before starting and find myself getting worked up over small things. I also tend to go to the bathroom and sit on my phone instead of going to the nice staffroom simply because i donâ€™t want to talk to anyone because Iâ€™m scared they will judge me or something idk. I just get the butterflies every time i go to work and mainly before work. Once i start however, i calm down a bit and feel fine. Any tips or anything would be helpful. Thanks ðŸ˜„",Anxiety
"Hi sorry I got really high and laid in bed and had a trippy experience with a guy who wasnâ€™t necessarily bad but kinda gave me heebie jeebiesâ€¦. Had a bit of
Paranoia but I laid down in bed and I forgot my backpack was behind me and there wasnâ€™t anything especially hard except my grinder and like I worried about hitting my head on my backpack on the grinder and hurting myself?

"   Dad was talking about living in the present moment the other day. He explained how we canâ€™t change the present moment whatsoever so we have no choice but to enjoy it and make the most of it. I talked about how the anxiety brings me out of the present moment, thinking about what others are thinking about me and obsessing over the uncomfort. I told him how I imagine that I am the only conscious being in the world. This way no one is conscious to have any negative thoughts or feelings toward me. If I imagine everyone is AI, I donâ€™t have to be so insecure because i know that nothing around me is really real in any way. My dad assured me this is extremely LONELY.",Anxiety
"Around 6 weeks ago I (23F) was placed on medical leave by my doctor for severe anxiety. (I am a first grade teacher)

It was really difficult being off at first. I kept thinking about the students and parents and how my room looked and who was taking care of them but after the first week I stopped checking emails completely and let whatever happened justâ€¦happen.

Going back was very nerve wracking for me. I was worried about what would be different, what would the kids say, would I be judged. But most of everyone I spoke to today was incredibly supportive and kind when they saw I was getting overwhelmed at the beginning of the day. I didnâ€™t delve into why I was on medical leave and no one really asked.

Really glad I got to see my students again and I hope everything stays nice and calm the rest of the year. Just wanted to share.",Anxiety
"It's not that I feel worried but rather that I just can't seem to relax. I can't remember the last time I was able to sit down and enjoy a TV show or movie without feeling guilty. My thoughts just seem Neverending at times. They aren't necessarily bad thoughts or self-deprecating, but my brain simply won't stop. I've cut down on caffeine significantly as well.

Other times, I feel anxious about simply heading home and to my bedroom because I know that I'll be left alone with my thoughts. It's like I'm constantly running away. Perhaps I do need to meditate. Other times, I simply accept and invite the anxiety in, take a deep breath, stare at my ceiling and let the thoughts in. It's a temporary fix but the anxiety does return.

Can anyone relate? I speak with my doctor on the 27th and I'm honestly hoping that medication will help. 

It's no way to live life.",Anxiety
"I feel like the world is moving sometimes, other times I feel vertigo, and others I feel nauseous or just dizzy, I donâ€™t know if this is normal when having anxiety, thatâ€™s why I ask, how do you feel when dizzy?",Anxiety
"So I would love some advice, support, or just to know if anyone else feels this way. So I've been in college for 7 years now. I've struggled in school for as long as I can remember and to no surprise, that has followed me into college. I know the reason why and I'm currently working on it so my problem is this time of year: graduation. 2 times I've been close to graduating and this semester, I applied and was suppose to graduate but once again, I failed and had to push it back another year. This year the last bit of my friends are graduating but I'm still here behind watching everyone move on with their lives. I'm struggling so badly with this. I know no one is leaving me but I still feel like I'm being abandoned. My anxiety attacks were calming down but recently they've started up again. I am getting help from my therapist for these things, but it still hasn't made this feeling go away. I try to be happy for everyone but it's so hard. I have no one in my life who could understand this so I guess I'm here to see if any of ya'll have experienced this or something similar to this. Just want to not feel so alone.",Anxiety
"Hi everyone, I suffer from anxiety for a couple of years now, I never really paid attention to it and I think that might have been a big mistake, now I suffer from pretty bad anxiety attacks but I still haven't figured out what causes them, my therapist told me it was key to figure out what causes my anxiety. I know that anxiety can be caused by many things. But
How did you find out what caused your anxiety?
Note: I used a translator so if there is a mistake I am sorry. :)
Have a nice day",Anxiety
"I started wanting to better my mental health this year to seek a psychiatrist to help with my crippling anxiety and insomnia. All of the medications prescribed has not helped or has made things worse and during my last appt my psychiatrist from Cerebral commented, â€œI wish I can help you.â€ 

So now Iâ€™ve decided to look for a new one. Curious to hear how many psychiatristâ€™s everyone has gone through to find someone whoâ€™s fit them? Feels like finding a good psychiatrist is like dating lol.

Just want a little bit of hope that Iâ€™m not the only person who is going/has gone through this. 

Thanks.",Anxiety

"Living in anxiety definitely sucks, i dont get to enjoy things i used to anymore, however something is concerning me because whenever i try to enjoy things such as watching comedy show, i dont feel totally immerse in it and when i laugh it doesnt feel genuine, its like im enjoying but at the same time im not totally enjoying it. Also it feels weird that my mind is calm, its like my mind is not used to it because it has been constantly anxious.",Anxiety
"I am sick and took an antigen/lat flow test that was a faint positive. Took a few more the same but when I tried a different brand it came up negative. I've had a false positive on the lat flow tests before. I did a pcr and am waiting on results but my anxiety is in overdrive. I feel like if the pcr comes back negative I've lied to my workplace and they will be mad at me as I have missed lots of work in the past due to being sick.

Any reassurance and strategies to calm down a bit would be helpful. Thanks",Anxiety
"So 6 months ago i met this girl. All my friends had left for college so i told her i only wanted to be friends. I also figured she was too attractive for me and didn't see us dating. 

A month into us being friends she got a boyfriend. it was around this same time we grew really close. We were hanging out almost daily, grocery shopping together, buying eachother gifts, always complimenting eachother, sleeping in the same bed, hugging and saying we loved eachother constantly, etc.

We've never done anything sexual, even tho there's been tension. like intense eye contact, talking really gentle/highpitched to eachother, cooking meals for eachother, sharing a chair and getting snuggled up. we've also confided with eachother about young trauma we haven't told anyone and we have cried together a lot.

we respect her relationship. her bf knows a lot about our friendship and doesn't seem to care.

my friend had always said if he had a problem with our friendship she would dump him, and that she'd choose me over him.

Idk if that's still the case now. we hangout maybe once every two weeks and she says she's in love and wants to marry him even tho it's only been like 4 months and they have had some issues. he's also got a kid and is 26 with a dui and she's only 18. but i'm not gonna touch on that really.

It just sucks. she constantly texts me she misses me, loves me, and hopes we can hang this week, and she misses how things were, but she never asks me to hang anymore, and when she does it's usually for a couple hours. and when she does see me she's always rubbing my back, hugging me, hitting my thigh and being all affectionate.

i just don't get it. yeah she's busy with her bf but how do we go from hanging almost daily to her never making time for me anymore. did she never really care about me? what makes it harder is my obvious feelings for her, and the fact she's my only friend. 

i certainly put all my eggs in one basket and am definitely too nice to her but idk what else to do.

i just feel like she doesn't like me anymore.",Anxiety
"I'm not sure if this is the right sub to share this experience, but I just really wanted to share this experience somewhere.

My entire life I have been dealing with anxiety and depression, and constantly have negative thoughts in my head. I never get a good night sleep and always wake up with back pain.

Then recently I was talking to someone and they noticed that my voice sounds flat and my nose seems stuffy. So they recommended me to go get my sinus checked.

I first went to an allergy doc but was then sent to a sinus specialist and was diagnosed with deviated septum and minor sinus problem.

Fast forward a few weeks, I got an endoscopic surgery to fix my problem and the positive effects is almost immediate. I don't feel the constant pressure in my head anymore. My sleeping improved dramatically. And all the negative thoughts and feelings started to subside. I still get minor anxiety here and there but the physical effects (elevated heart rate, constant rumination and etc) are almost gone (or at least very manageable now).

I am 28 and can't believe it took me this long to realized this. Breathing is very important to your mental state. I think this is the main reason why meditation has such a positive effects on your mental state, it's literally just breathing.

To anyone dealing with anxiety, I know how tough it is...just breath through it. Good luck to everyone.",Anxiety

"Hi! I have anxiety for a long time but over the last week I noticed that my chest is really tight, over my heart. It feels like someone is squeezing it or someone is sitting on my chest. I also have been feeling very lightheaded and out of it as well as having a very upset stomach. 

I am doing a lot of job interviews right now, Iâ€™m in my last week of grad school, working through family trauma, hiding depressive episode stuff from my family, losing friends, and Iâ€™m a teacher which comes with almost daily anxiety. I didnâ€™t put the 2 and 2 together until today. Can anxiety really cause chest pain that feels like you are on the brink of a heart attack?! Iâ€™m 25 F so low chance of that happening btw. Have any of you had any of the physical symptoms listed above? Did meds help at all for those of you that take them?",Anxiety

"So recently I have been experiencing really bad anxiety to the point I am shakey and feel sick to my stomach. I have always had bad anxiety but it has recently gotten a lot worse, I don't wish to go into detail as to why this has happened but it has been troubling, but what happened really triggered my anxiety. Now, whenever I try and sleep I feel sick with anxiety because whenever I go to sleep it's just me and my mind nothing else to distract me from my anxiety. If anyone has any ideas to help me get over this then I would be grateful, I'm tired of feeling like this.",Anxiety
"Of course it would make sense, getting dressed and ready to go anywhere has different stressors that are related to it. 

I have recently realized I am crippled with anxiety every time I go to change my clothes to go anywhere. It doesn't matter if I am excited to go to this place or not. 

I know it isn't fashion anxiety. I long stopped caring what I look like in public. Lol. It's crew necks and leggings only in this house. 

I just can't figure out why this happens. I take Celexa and have a GAD. Am I dredding going out? Do I have transition anxiety? What the hell is my deal?",Anxiety
"About two months ago I had an incident with a low battery alarm on my carbon monoxide detector. I was listening to the beeps because it wasn't constant, I would check the alarm and it wouldn't give any indication of anything. While I was staring at the device it beeped again and gave the ""LB"" indication. At that moment I went into a state of dread and fear that I have never felt before. Instantly started to panic, checked on my kids to make sure they were breathing and spent the rest of the night in utter fear of death and loosing control. The next day I noticed that my depression was completely gone but it was replaced by high anxiety. I have had clinical depression my entire life starting when I was very young like around 5 years old, I am 32 now. Once the incident happened, I felt completely disassociated from my body and the world around me with constant panic attacks, the longest panic attack lasting a little over four hours.

On top of all of that I have become ultra sensitive to medication, especially anti-anxiety medication. The only medication that seems to be helping throughout the day is vyvanse. I did one of those gene test to identify which medications I should try and which meds I should stay away from. I only had one med that was on the green tab, pristiq. I tried it, but on the second day I ended  up getting a panic attack that morphed into a couple of symptoms that I never experienced, I got a metallic taste in my mouth and my body instantly went cold starting from my feet and traveling up. I ended up in the ER with either some strange side effects or serotonin syndrome, they wouldn't tell me for sure.

Its been about two months and my depression is still gone, but my anxiety is still sky high. Every medication I try makes things worse. I am desperately trying to figure out why I switched so suddenly, it doesn't make any sense. I have an MRI tomorrow to make sure I don't have anything serious wrong like a tumor. 

I can not find anything through my internet research that closely resembles my sudden switch from depression to anxiety. I am reaching out to see if anyone else has had this happen to them and what the outcome was. I feel so alone; it has even stumped my doctors.",Anxiety
"my anxiety sky rockets. Itâ€™s impossible to feel relief without medication that knocks me out. The intrusive thoughts that everyone I know and love will die overnight or that Iâ€™ll lose my house and be homeless, I canâ€™t take it.

"I broke up with my boyfriend for the final time yesterday (we were in an on-and-off relationship for some time), and I can't seem to deal with it. My anxiety makes me freeze in place.

I've got to get to my Uni in 20 minutes and the moment opened the curtains to look outside, I realised I physically cannot make myself step out. The anxiety is too much. I don't know how to deal with this. How do I make myself function?",Anxiety
"Hello! Many years ago, my doc prescribed Celexa (I believe it was 20mg). After a few months I noticed no difference in my anxiety.

Has anyone had positive experiences with any type of prescribed anxiety medication? I donâ€™t need names, just experiences.

"Iâ€™ve struggled with anxiety for many many years especially when it comes to leaving the house. But I manage fairly well to keep it under control, especially when Iâ€™m with someone. 

6 months ago me and my partner booked/planned our first holiday for October this year. Itâ€™s in a very private area (centre parcs) . We wonâ€™t need to go abroad and you can just stay in your accommodation. so I thought it would be best for my anxiety at least until I get used to staying in unfamiliar places with him. Iâ€™ve only stayed in unfamiliar places with my family where they have been before. 

But for some reason recently the thought of it is making me so anxious Iâ€™m struggling to function. Iâ€™m struggling with a lot of anxiety at the moment anyways but this is just making it worse. 

I think my biggest fear it being away from our home for a week in a place neither of us have been. I also have anxiety about the relationship which is making second guess the holiday and how it will turn out once we get there (if we get there)

We also have a lot of problems (not between us but with our house and my family) that require a lot of money and attention which could also stop us from going. 

I donâ€™t want my anxiety to stop us doing stuff as for the first 9 months of our relationship it hinder a lot of what we could do. But I worked on it and manage to keep it relatively under control. 

But since we planned this holiday my partners been more open to planning more things. Which whilst Iâ€™m excited to try new things thinking about it makes my anxiety go through the roof. But itâ€™s hard to not think about it because we have to organise it. Itâ€™s affecting my sleep (aswell as other things) and Iâ€™ve lost a lot of weight (it could be unrelated but when Iâ€™m anxious I lose weight anyway)

This was partially a rant so I could put it into words but also asking if anyone experiences the same? What ways do you have that helps you cope? Should I put my anxiety first and put boundaries in place? I donâ€™t want to hurt my partner because it isnâ€™t his fault. Is it unfair to him that I feel this way?

When we finished she talked about setting me up with some longer more intensive sessions specifically for social anxiety and logically I know I need something for my social anxiety but I just couldn't stand the thought of actually going through with that so I turned them down.

Taxes are due, both cars need oil changes, inspections and registration renewals, I need to schedule pest control, both of my dogs need vet visits, Iâ€™m well overdue a Dr visit and to top it all off, tonight I noticed a smell coming from an AC vent in the house so Iâ€™m pretty sure someone is going to have to come and check that out. Every time I check one thing off the long list of to dos, something else pops up. Most of my anxiety comes from interacting with people, both on the phone and in person. So none of this is easy for me. 

This is really just a vent to people who might understand. Iâ€™m incredibly stressed and I have no one. Not a single person.",Anxiety

"Hello all!

My Dr. decided to start me on 10mg Lexapro (daily) and 0.5mg of Lorazepam (to take at night so I can start sleeping again and then for use as an emergency pill after that). I have bad health anxiety which has always been my biggest concern with taking medication.

Iâ€™m convinced I have bowel cancer or some sort of internal bleeding thatâ€™s making me tiredâ€¦.please any advice",Anxiety

Havenâ€™t been to the hospital in years but this one was rough. Disassociation, panic, flushed, dizziness, shaky legs, fear of death, the whole nine yards. Went to the hospital, and of course, they ran all my vitals, did some blood tests, and everything came back negative. My question is, Iâ€™m still feeling pretty dizzy and feel like my breathing is really tight. Anyone else have an anxiety episode that starts with a panic attack and lasts for days?

"So I (20 m) just failed my driving test. Most of my friends got their licenses when they were 17/18 and while I tried to learn to drive then, I had a really bad experience and developed a fear of driving and didnâ€™t start trying again till i was 19, just before I turned 20 (Im about to turn 21).    

I really put a lot of effort in to overcome my fear and anxiety and even managed to overcome being crashed into again in January. I booked my driving test and about 20 days before my test, I was having panic attacks, nightmares and just anxiety every night. 

And now Iâ€™ve failed, people donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m so upset, telling me to chill out and that so many people fail first time. But they donâ€™t seem to understand Iâ€™m not upset about failing, Iâ€™m upset that Iâ€™m now going to have go through all of that anxiety again leading up to my next test.

"Lately I have been struggling with anxiety more and I don't really know why.
Recently I went to do a first aid course and I noticed that my ospofigus felt a bit tight and It was hard to breathe I could still breathe but I had to breathe a little harder and I had to think about it.
Then I started stressing more because if I end up having a panic attack or I stop breathing it's going to be very awkward in the room and they were talking about breathing that wasn't helping really I think one of them noticed something strange about me getting ready for something to happen.

Also last Sunday I went to a small car meet my friend had put together who does some awesome charity work with mind a charity that specialises in mental health. We all had a awesome chat and I was completely fine but for some reason driving home I started to find it hard to swallow and my osophogus felt right and it was harder to breathe again. I diddnt have my GPS on but I knew the way home but only by the sign I was a sign I was looking out for as I usally have a GPS on but my phone battery was dead however it was charging on a battery pack and I don't know what was panicking me i made it there without GPS and I'm usally fine with driving i love driving my little car around listening to music. Though for some reason music makes anxiety worse I kept fiddling with the volume down and up down and up however a song came on what I liked so I turned it up and sung it and I know that sounds weird but it helped a little for some reason. Then I eventually found the sign I was looking for turned off then I was alright. I don't understand the stress though as the only thing I was worrying about was my breathing if I was to get lost I had my phone charging I could find some were to pull over I also had a backup gps in the back of my car aswell for just incase I run out of battery however it's laggy.

I wasn't the only one stressing my phone was off and my parents track me on a app and it said I was out of battery so they diddnt know we're exactly I was they knew I was at a car meet but they worry about something happening.",Anxiety

"Struggling with food - sorry if this is wrong sub Reddit but

Iâ€™ve been struggling with eating and itâ€™s making me very sad. Iâ€™m a fifteen year old girl, around 5,4 and the last time I weighed myself I was a bit underweight but I probably gained some more pounds. Iâ€™m very anxious about food. 
I always felt insecure about my body. I always had thoughts of starving myself as a punishment. Iâ€™m an overachiever and need to get perfect grades or I hate myself. My brain would say â€œyou got an 80? You donâ€™t deserve dinner!â€ But Iâ€™d be hungry and eat and feel guilty. I canâ€™t shake the feeling I donâ€™t deserve foodâ€¦ like I didnâ€™t work out for it or work hard enough for it. 
Itâ€™s getting worse now. I started eating healthy - all I used to eat was pasta and bread. I started eating lots of veggies and fruits, banned foods like pizza and pasta for whole grains. Sounds great and I loved it. But then I had a thought.. â€œhealthy people count their calories, so I should too.â€ So I did and realized I was having way over. I started then dropped to the limits online said for sedentary Iâ€™m sedentary so I did that. And all I do is binge. Once a week, twice. I binged just now on dark chocolate -  extra calories. I binged really bad on Friday. And it started when Iâ€™ve tracked my calories. 
I hate eating bc it leads to a binge. I count cals in my meals because Iâ€™m scared to get fat. My family calls me skinny and gorgeous. Whenever I wear tight clothes, they say â€œskin and bones,â€ but still call me tall and beautiful. Iâ€™m scared to hang out with my friends bc thatâ€™s when my binges happen. I feel so out of control but when I stay in my cal limit I feel in control. I have to go to a dance aaand Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll binge there too. Binge, binge. I hate it.
My mom has a binge problem - sheâ€™s seeing a therapist. Iâ€™ve seen therapists before and one said I had an anxiety disorder. I donâ€™t want them saying I have some sort of ED bc I do eat, Iâ€™m not dying Iâ€™m not loosing hair. I just donâ€™t want to get up tmr bc Iâ€™m afraid of food.
I need to fit into my dress and Iâ€™m binging like crazy. I hate it and I feel so guilty. Iâ€™m not even enjoying the food. I go over my limit a bit and my brain has this â€œyou might as well binge now you failureâ€ and the floodgates open. Help, please. I donâ€™t want to live like this anymore. Iâ€™m afraid to eat I donâ€™t want to gain weight. I want to stop the cravings. I want to stop the binges. I want to stop worrying about my grades but thatâ€™s all my thoughts are.

"Hi! New poster so I apologize for any mistakes! 

Iâ€™ve been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks since I was in middle school, and I know that they are caused by abandonment issues, as well as some insecurities. I know exactly what my triggers are, why they happen and what specific fear is causing themâ€¦.so for the most part I have been able to manage it without medication or therapy. Unfortunately, things began to peak two years ago during the beginning of covid and my stress and anxiety ended up actually causing shingles. After this, and getting covid, a few other random symptoms began to occur during major anxiety episodes. These still happen to this day, when it gets bad enough, but doctors have assured me these symptoms are my â€œpost covid norm nowâ€. A lot happened in that time to cause it, so it wasnâ€™t one specific trigger like it used to be. Ever since, I have had a much more difficult time controlling the spiraling that occurs once the thoughts creep in. It is now affecting my personal relationships as well. 

My question is, how are you able to manage the physical and emotional symptoms of anxiety when a major episode does occur? Is medication and therapy really the best and only solution?",Anxiety

Iâ€™m at my wits end. I donâ€™t know what to do. Therapy did very little for me. Anxiety meds donâ€™t help unless Iâ€™m having a full blown attack and they help me calm down, but if I just take them on a â€œnormalâ€ day, all they do is make me sleepy.

Hello all I hope this is the right place to ask. Before I say anything yes I am seeing a cardiologist and talking with my doctor but thought I would also ask on here to see if anyone has seen or had a similar experience. Since about two years ago I have had pretty bad health anxiety it all started one day when I got dizzy for no cause and spiralled into worrying every day that I was going to die from something new. When I would stop worrying about something something new would come up. Anyway Iâ€™ve delt with almost all this anxiety and am way better now except for this.my heart rate is extremely low when resting 40s-50s and this is normal and runs in my family. It all started 7-8 months ago where every time I stand up it is rising to 110-130 aswell as I am getting extremely out of breath. I rarely get lightheadedness and I have never passed out from it though it is extremely uncomfortable. This has now progressed into every time I eat food my heart going up to 100-110 and with just light movement while sitting or lying down it will sky rocket and pound in my chest. Usually once I start walking around it will get better but if I try to exercise it will immediately get bad again. I get really bad heart palpitations every time I exercise where my heart thuds and feels like itâ€™s beating out of place though I read some people can get this with exercise. The issue is Iâ€™m a mechanic and my work requires me to be moving around so I am constantly feeling this and it is getting to the point where I wonder if itâ€™ll kill me I canâ€™t play sports anymore or do a lot of things I used too. My questions are could this be all anxiety related and everyone experiences this and just doesnâ€™t notice like I do since Iâ€™m so observant of my body or could it be something serous? I thought it may be pots can stress cause that? I have seen a cardiologist already in the last year and had a clean ekg a heart untrasound come back clear blood work and my blood pressure is good. I used to smoke but stopped as it makes this worse and I smoke pot occasionaly but this also makes my symptoms almost unbearable so I try to avoid it too. Thanks In advance everyone. I really think this could all be cause by anxiety as due to it Iâ€™m always worried but wanted to see if anyone else has had any similar experiences",Anxiety

Iâ€™ve been having a rough time recently so I decided to go out for the day and try to really enjoy myself. I donâ€™t go out very often, especially since Covid hit, so this was like kindâ€™ve a big day for me lol. I went to the zoo up in a big city thatâ€™s an hour from my rural town and driving in cities can really stress me out. I went to get ramen and bubble tea after and then I ended my day with an amazing therapy appointment. I was anxious for pretty much allll of the excursion. I was still having a good time though, getting to look at all the animals was super enjoyable. The bubble tea and ramen were amazing too. Anyway, I dress in an alternative metal-goth type of style and Iâ€™ve been really stepping up my game with it recently. Today I wore these y2k emo style flare jeans, fishnets under my black shirt, a beanie, and my platform docs. I loved my outfit and these jeans are like my favorite but I was still anxious over it, which is probably because I got stared at so much today. I have literally never had this many people stare at me before!! In the bubble tea place, this girl was actually whispering to her friend about me. Despite all this, I felt like I had a really good day but I still couldnâ€™t calm my anxiety down. I was visibly shaking while waiting for my food and during my therapy appointment it was even worse. I didnâ€™t feel as nervous in my mind like I normally do though. Idk, I like wasnâ€™t freaking out all that much in my head but my body would just not stopâ€¦ 
and it still hasnâ€™t stopped 5 hours later. Just an hour ago my mother said I was visibly shaking and I didnâ€™t even notice until she pointed it out. Right now Iâ€™m in my room listening to the rain and feeling mostly okay, maybe a tiny bit anxious, but I am still fidgeting and shaking.

"Hello Internet friends! Iâ€™ve been someone who has struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember, I honestly canâ€™t remember life without it. It really peaked back a few years ago when my life did a 360 out of no where and I had a pretty bad medical crisis and almost died after being perfectly healthy my whole life.

Does anyone relate and/ or have advise? I tried different gas X and it worked with a higher dose, but I ended up getting constipated or diarrhea and nausea which wasnâ€™t worth it after dealing with that for so long.

"TLDR- student teacher havenâ€™t done work before next semester due to anxiety related work avoidance/ generally being paralysed by fear. should I go in and admit to having done terrible minimal work or take a break from studies and still leave them picking up the slack? At this point I just want to disappear but Iâ€™m ruling out that option. 

I am a student-teacher and start back on work placement tomorrow. I have been paralysed by anxiety all break and havenâ€™t done the prep work I was supposed to, frankly I am terrified of even starting work tomorrow and donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to get through the day. 

My perfectionism/ fear of standing in front of a class and being constantly judged by the regular class teacher has sent me to a dark place and has meant that Iâ€™m now trying to catch up on 2 weeks of work tonight (I am making progress but itâ€™s slow between the crying, rocking and general feelings of terror) so now I know I will be going in with no sleep which will mean my performance will be even worse. 

I want to run away, just get on a bus and disappear. that or just lay in bed paralysed and shutting out the world. I am terrified of going in tomorrow and admitting to all I havenâ€™t done because I have always wanted to be seen as the successful one and donâ€™t want them to get angry that I donâ€™t have stuff ready. 

Part of me wants to take a brake from studies but I donâ€™t know if that will burn bridges- it will certainly set me back a year in my career as I will have to make up the time if I take time out. Plus my brain tends to over exaggerate consequences and see running away as the best option. 

My parents are somewhat aware of the situation but not to the extent where my brain is making me want to hide under the covers and never leave the house again. They want me to just power through so telling them Iâ€™m feeling this way will probably upset them. 

Should I apply to take time out? Teaching isnâ€™t exactly something you can muddle through you are performing literally every day. Just go in and bear with the consequences (I think if they got mad at me even if it was justified I would genuinely lost it)? Is there a better path forward? My head feels so fuzzy and Iâ€™m just trying to make a plan of attack so I donâ€™t end up just turning my phone off and hiding in my apartment pretending the world outside doesnâ€™t exist or that I donâ€™t exist like my brain wants to. 

If anyone has any strategies for bringing up mental health related not doing work with bosses/ college staff that would be great too.

"Holy CRAP.

I've always had anxiety, and I get like low level panic attacks in certain situations, but this shit is next level. 

Me and my fiance decided to move to a new state, big expensive city. Why? At this point I have no idea.

 ""Better Opportunities"" 

""More things to do""

""Bored  of our home town""

""It'll be fun"" 

NO. Just No. Omfg. 

3 weeks here and our car broke down, needs a new engine. Car we owe a shit ton of money on still. 

Wtf do we do? Well I cried to my dad and he's gonna help us figure it out. But I just feel like a bit of a failure and my anxiety is through the ROOF. 

I feel like I have dementia, everytime I look around I'm like ""Whoa. This is my life. This is my apartment. This is my new job, in a new city in a new state, wtf"" 

I look forward to bed time and the evening everyday. I just want to go home, play sims and forget I uprooted my entire life on a whim.

I recently started a master's degree. I have been suffering with anxiety the past year or so but starting this degree has increased it. I feel like I am spending so much time thinking and worrying too much about the future. I find it hard not to think too far ahead into the future.

"I think insecurity and anxiety can go hand-in-hand or possibly be mistaken for one another in some instances, and I'm examining/reflecting on how my insecurities may be exacerbated by my anxiety and vice versa.

I have huge fear-of-missing-out issues. If I find out friends did something without me I obsess over why I wasn't invited and why I wasn't good enough to be included. It drives me to always be 'around' and 'available' and 'reachable' so that there's no excuse not to reach out to me and invite me along on activities.

Hello Everyone!  I am 21 years old, in 1 year of my MS degree in Physics. I have been suffering with depression and anxiety because of various things and it's effecting my studies badly. I was looking for a support group of peers, people who are facing similar issues: difficulties in coping up with studies due to mental health problems.

I felt like there might be more like me who might need this. Hence, the post

Features of this support group:

1. The group and all it's activity will be based on discord, so that no one feels uncomfortable sharing their personal details
2. A place where we could cheer each other up, study subjects together, teach/explain/present a certain topic we studied to get a clear understanding of it and to gain confidence.
3. Students would be in the age group of 18-25 (College students only)
4. This group will not serve in any form as a replacement to therapy/counselling and should not be used with that mindset.
5. Not exceeding 10 members (I am not sure about this, but I feel the smaller the group, the better it will be for all of us. This might change in future)
6. We could conduct a group study session and study together in a group call on discord
7. People belonging to the same subjects or even different, can have little informal discussions about interesting topic in their fields, to boost their confidence in studies.
8. All the members have to treat each other respectfully and with empathy and no judgments, any form of rudeness or apathy could effect the members badly and hence won't be tolerated.
9. I wish to make it specific to Physics or Science in general, but I am open to making it in general for all students (in the age group mentioned)

This is the brief plan I have for the group, I haven't thought about the details. I want to know if anyone will be interested in being a part of this group or whether they know a support group like this which already exists.

Please let me know in the comments or dms whether you are interested or have any kind of suggestions.",Anxiety
"Ive been away from my house for about a week now and ive been in basically a constant state of panic ever since. 

My girlfriend is home with them when shes not working but for the past 2 years ive been battling serious depression and anxiety and this is the first time ive been away from them.

We have 3 cats and two bunnies. One of our bunnies is truly my best friend. I have not experienced a bond with an animal like him since my childhood cat passed away 

I know i have terrible anxiety but i don't know what causes this to get so bad.

It could be because i moved out about a year before my cat passed away and i regret not spending that time with him. But about a year or so ago my rabbit woke me up one morning shaking and spazzing out uncontrollably to what we found out was just a bad ear infection. It was so hard to wake up to that.

* When do I know if the pain or struggle is so much that I should give up and say I can't (or shouldn't) go ahead with this?
* Am I not punishing myself by continually putting myself in situations like these?
* If I visibly fuck up at work, will I be able to deal with the negative feelings -- embarrassment, shame, guilt, depression, etc.?
* How do I know if burnout is temporaryÂ or permanent?
* Is it safe to tell my supervisors I am burned out?
* What the fuck would I do if not this job?
* If I can't make *this*Â job work, could I make *any* work?
* Is there a way to rebalance my life so I don't burn out?
* What will give me energy outside of work?

* Can I handle responsibility?

"Angst, I, Tea

Do you know?
How to wake yourself up in the morning?
As the tempest festers your whole body,
How not to choke on your own breathing?

Do you know?
How to get up and just stop staring the ceiling?
How to walk those three steps leading to the basin?
The washing..ah! The washing might come later,
That might be someone's ten minute routine,
But can take up my whole whole day...
Thinking whether or not should I get up at all today,
Such is the angst...
And it is not in the head, like some would say,

You don't know, do you?
The sweaty hands fumbling to make that morning tea,
The sea sickness without the sea,
Words gagging you before you could even think,
Oh thinking! It's over, when 'it' is over,

Do you know?
Living with the urge of wanting to know all that can go wrong,
Like a geek's browser with those countless tabs,
All just left open, all at the same time,
And yet you expect from me to not even crash?

Tell me! do you know?
How do I even close them? 
I wish there existed a button...
Unfortunately there is none,

Do you know?
Just like the real numbers, 
I too have a plus and a minus, 
I too have a rational and an irrational,
The minus and the irrational are good friends,
Too strong for my rational and plus,

""Do you know?
They constantly whisper and keep you down and you let them"" said my rational.
I knew, but the tabs are always too many to process,
And the minus looks over all, for now.

Do you know?
At nights the whispering gets loudest,
Like a noisy concert inside your own ear,
You would want to deafen yourself purposely if you slept with me,
The bed won't let you fall asleep...
...and then it won't let you get up, 
Funny, right? No!
Such is the anxiety!

However, if one day you know,
Or perhaps you just want to know, like I do,
I'll have you over for a cup of the fumbling tea,

I have had anxiety since I was a little kid. I have always noticed that it seems like I will be pretty good anxiety wise for years and then bam out of nowhere it comes out very strong.

"Ever since my mom lost her primary source of income things have gotten downhill. Relationship between the 4 of us (Grandma, Uncle, Sister, &amp; I) and her have been nothing but a war zone. Of course the peacekeeper was my grandma until she was gone from this world. This in turn causes my uncle to leave because he couldn't handle my mother craziness. 

Fast forward 2 years. My mother and I are responsible for the house, however she is very irresponsible, So my sister and I took the responsibility. If there wasn't enough responsibility she also brought in cats because its lonely in the house, and guess who responsible for it, us. Every day when she come home, she will always complain every little thing and put the blame on us, instead of taking responsibility herself. To top it off of all of these, our finance aren't great either since my sister and I graduated high school at the same time and decided to enter the workforce afterward so we started at the rock bottom, low pay. Not to mention my mother prioritize on the cat over us, I say this because she always nice to them but always mean to us. Doesn't seem fair to me. 

Just recently she verbally stated that she has a gun and will shoot anyone who gets in the family way because her thoughts of a cat meow means that someone is trying to rob our house. This is the last straw and my option is pretty much non existence, only leads to a death trap. I tried getting help for her, but she keeps refusing to listen. I can't move because well this is my house and rent is too expensive elsewhere compare to living here. Living in a college dorm would put us in more extra debt. Live and deal with her will only cause us to go insane.

Is death the only option? I see no logical way out of this at all. Only the death of this family.

I know how to act pretty normally around my friends or other people even though on the inside Iâ€™m having a panic attack, but when Iâ€™m alone thereâ€™s nothing keeping me from keeping everything inside so I just have a breakdown and it makes me feel worse.

"Hi I need some advice, 3 weeks ago I went to the hospital and got a blood test, right after the blood test I fainted and hit my head, but I was fine. Now last week I went to play soccer on Saturday and Sunday (I play on two teams). Saturday I got elbowed to the jaw, and then an hour later lightly kicked in the same spot. My jaw hurt that day but the pain went away after around 15 hours. The next day I played soccer, during this time I felt really really dizzy, and I couldnâ€™t focus or play. I tried driving back home and I couldnâ€™t, it felt like I was driving drunk. 

Now a week later Iâ€™m still dizzy for most of the day everyday. Today I went to see my doctor to tell him about how I think itâ€™s a concussion. 
My symptoms include
- Dizziness all day
- Loud noises make it worse (I tried going to church and couldnâ€™t last 5 mins without leaving)
- Too much movement makes it worse (soccer, looking left to right or up to down)
- pain on left/ right side of skull
- Being in a car makes it bad (constant and severe dizziness in cars)

I told him all this and he just told me because of my history with anxiety/ocd itâ€™s most likely anxiety and that I should start taking (ssris/ snris). When I told him anxiety has never given me dizziness before and iâ€™m not even anxious he said it doesnâ€™t matter anxiety doesnâ€™t make sense. He said itâ€™s possible itâ€™s a concussion but thinks itâ€™s anxiety.

Iâ€™d like your opinion, do you think this can be anxiety even tho I never ever felt dizzy from anxiety before and have no reason to be anxious all week?",Anxiety

"I have been having dissociating anxiety today and I feel so out of it. I have an interview tomorrow on Zoom and I think that is a big factor for me. Iâ€™ve been thinking about it since last Friday.

"for the past few years  my (15M) anxiety has been something that's been building up due to the amount of times i've been stressed out or pressured by my family and at first it started off as being mild where i could easily handle it however nowadays any problem, small or not can trigger my anxiety.

wether it's being ignored, doing something slightly wrong, making mistakes, or being yelled at, etc i can't never seem to get out of it what so ever.. and it's led me to become a very clingy person who needs constant reassurance from those who i really trust so i can calm down and and remember all the positive things in my life and sometimes i have no choice but to go to my family for reassurance (even if they don't reassure me i end up going to them when i have no choice only to get hurt even more)

but i don't know if it's my anxiety or not but i'm starting to sense how i may be bothering people whenever i act clingy and i don't want to feel this way at all since i know that it can be annoying to deal with someone like that but i don't know what to do. My anxiety is at a worser state than it's ever been to the point where i'm starting to doubt someone that i really trust on wether or not they are getting tired of me (or starting to) because i rely and cling onto them too much since they are the only one i talk to nowadays and i trust their word more than anyone else.

i just want to know what i could do to stop this, i've been thinking on going to edibles so that way i can cope with my anxiety and feel calm but i just dont know what to do my anxiety is affecting me in many ways that i constantly doubt people all the time (even if i trust them) thinking that they'll be fed up with me at some point and then abandon me, i just want to stop being like this, i can't take it anymore.. i just want to be able to stop doubting people and believe in their good intentions without geting anxious because of me feeling like they might get annoyed at me.",Anxiety
"Iâ€™ve had bad medical anxiety all my life, especially having to do with needles. When I was pregnant with my son 11 years ago I had gestational diabetes, so I had to prick my finger 4x/day, in addition to all the needles and medical stuff surrounding pregnancy and childbirth. 

About 4 years ago I was diagnosed with Crohnâ€™s after a bunch of invasive medical procedures, and get I treatment through an IV every 6 weeks. I used to take Xanax and have my husband drive me and stay with me while they started the IV, but when Covid started no visitors were allowed so I stopped taking the Xanax and started driving myself. Honestly, Iâ€™ve been proud of myself for how Iâ€™ve handled all of it, as I never thought Iâ€™d be able to. 

A few weeks ago I had genetic testing done and found out I carry a gene that increases my risk for breast and other cancers. I will need increased monitoring and Iâ€™ve been told to get an MRI with contrast (which means an IV) in the next few weeks. Iâ€™ve also had two doctors request that I get routine lab work done. 

I donâ€™t know why all of this feels different, but Iâ€™m having a mental block about scheduling these things. I know itâ€™s the responsible thing to do, but it feels like too much at the moment. Iâ€™m catastrophizing about the breast MRI because Iâ€™m really worried theyâ€™ll find something.

"Hi everyone!

I hope this finds you well. Iâ€™m really in a mood to talk to my therapist about a couple things, but sheâ€™s out of town on vacation so I wonâ€™t see her for some time, so I figured Iâ€™d swing by here. 

Anyway, a problem I always run into is like, this, â€œthereâ€™s always a bigger fish idea.â€ Usually Iâ€™ll overcome some source of anxiety â€” maybe Iâ€™ve got an interview coming up, but now I feel good about it â€” only to invent some silly, irrational alternative or â€œnext stepâ€ to worry about. Like, oh, Iâ€™m feeling comfortable about my interview, but what if I get the job and everyone despises me? That sort of stuff. 

Any advice on how to stop those sorts of cycles?

Also, Iâ€™d love tips on how you guys distract yourself. When Iâ€™m alone and Iâ€™m anxious, Iâ€™m really bad about just perpetuating things that make me more anxious. Getting up and stretching and moving around helps, but Iâ€™d love if you guys have any other suggestions.",Anxiety

"Hi everyone,

So I was hoping to look for some advice and some assistance regarding a recurring problem Iâ€™m running into. Iâ€™m having a pretty anxious afternoon, so if this post is a little scatterbrained, I apologize. 

First things first:

Iâ€™m pretty anxious around alcohol. I generally donâ€™t like when people around me drink. I prefer to not be around it when I can help it; and I myself am sober. 

Okay, on to the details.

Iâ€™m in a serious long term relationship. Alcohol has been a frequent trigger for my anxiety. My girlfriend is not a problem drinker at all; she doesnâ€™t drink very often. But when she does, it makes me very anxious. 

Weâ€™ve had a couple of arguments about this, and a lot of conversations. She just turned 21, and, generally, Iâ€™ve been getting much better about this. She got two drinks on her birthday while I was with her, and I handled it without much anxiety being triggered. 

She went to a bar (without me. Sheâ€™s very good about not making me come along to things she know would trigger me, and I should say that she is VERY considerate of my feelings and anxiety, and that sheâ€™s an amassing girlfriend) after her birthday dinner. I made it through â€” a little bit anxious, but I was mostly able to just play games and stay relaxed. 

My big fear, my big stressor, is a trip sheâ€™s taking this weekend. Sheâ€™s going out of town with her mom, her sister, and some of their friends. I know theyâ€™re going to do a lot of drinking. 

This is obviously a trigger. I was doing okay about it, but, last night, my brain decided to come up with some new things to trigger me, so Iâ€™m feeling like Iâ€™ve lost all my progress getting comfortable with her drinking. 

Now, I should say that I was getting better; Iâ€™ve got a lot more comfortable with it; Iâ€™m trying my hardest. I honestly think Iâ€™d be fine, except I wanted to meet with my therapist this week to talk about it, but sheâ€™s on vacation and isnâ€™t back until the day my girlfriend gets back. 

So, hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m asking for:

- Do you have any advice for coping with irrational fears? When it comes to my girlfriend drinking, the fears that trigger me are not things I consider rational, but I cycle through them in my head. How can I stop that?
- Do you have any advice for keeping myself busy while sheâ€™s out? I work 1-930 on Saturday, so Iâ€™m not too worried then, but the Friday sheâ€™ll be gone I have nothing planned, so Iâ€™m worried about keeping my mind distracted. 
- I often struggle with hearing stories involving alcohol. Do you have advice for ways I can say â€œIâ€™m not mad at you, Iâ€™m happy you had fun, but I canâ€™t hear this story right now?â€
- When I begin to get comfortable with the trigger, I tend to event something that makes me more anxious. For example, Iâ€™m feeling better about her weekend trip, so then my brain decides to make myself worry about, â€œwell what if now she wants to go to the bar every weekend?â€ Setting aside that thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that â€” any advice on preventing yourself from freaking out about problems and worries that havenâ€™t even happened yet?

Thank you for taking the time to read this, if you did. I am generally not looking for relationship advice â€” mostly coping advice. My girlfriend is wonderful and my relationship is genuinely amazing. Sheâ€™s very supportive and understanding, and itâ€™s the least I can try to do to try to get more comfortable with it.",Anxiety
"Donâ€™t make the same mistakes I did. Iâ€™m fine with how it turned out, but thatâ€™s mostly because I broke my self. I have no connection to my life. (If you want a description of that, read this through: You probably know how people say â€žDonâ€™t live in the past or the future, live the nowâ€œ. Well people arenâ€™t wrong about this being good to calm you down but if you do it wrong you end up like I do. Iâ€™m basically living in the now with only a few things I remember from the past and a few things I expect to happen. Itâ€™s simply making me rest, but also losing touch to reality. My life is a circle.) Get help no matter how. Staying through this will f*ck with you mentally as well as physically. If you canâ€™t get help donâ€™t try to push through this forcing you to do whatever needs to be done. As said Iâ€™m not unhappy with how it is now but I also know that thereâ€™s no way for me to turn it around now. Iâ€™ve brought myself to traumatize myself in order to keep me from ending it. Seems ironic but it is what it is. Iâ€™m losing touch with reality more and more. Itâ€™s like dying but more like your consciousness dies instead of you. Whatsoever, donâ€™t end up like I did. You might think this would cure anything but it also takes a risk Iâ€™m aware of. The further you go the harder it will hit you once your anxiety stops or whatever cures you.

"I wanted to share what Iâ€™ve been going through. Im 23 M whoâ€™s never really had anxiety before. Dealt with depression for a couple of years but it was manageable and I beat it after I moved out. About 3 months ago I came back from a camping trip in which I contracted the flu and strep throat. My doctor gave me a Medrol steroid pack for my throat. About 4 days in I had a panic attack that I though was a heart attack. Ever since then, Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder, Mild Recurring Panic Disorder, and Major Depressive disorder, as well as feeling depersonalization. Ive been on Zoloft for about a month and this Wednesday will be 3 weeks on Lexapro since I switched. However, I donâ€™t feel like its working.

"I get serious anxiety and always think I have done something wrong.  Some things are silly, some things are ridiculous, and some I may have legit concern over.  Thing is, I seek reassurance from friends/friend in particular.  I am too open and say things.

Anyways, when I say something to a friend, I ask them for their advice, I would then say 'is that bad?', and ask for reassurance.  Some friends say I am being silly, some tolerate it, some tell me straight I am being too much, like my best friend, but i have one good friend who now just ghosts me, and it kills me.

I think, Have i done something wrong, is he going to say things, will he just tell people I am weird, would he say anything to anyone, I confronted him around a month ago and said listen have I done something i don't want to force a friendship, he then said no it's fine, and continued to ghost me.

I don't get it, I feel bad, and wonder if he thinks I have done something wrong and if he would tell people about the thigns i tell him, and i use to trust him a lot, we use to be close, it eats me up, some days I wake up and I feel really down.  I reach out to him as a friend, and he will go days without replying or messaging and just ignore me.  

If anyone has anxiety, you know that it makes things worse, and you feel like someone knows your struggles and can share them, and it makes things ten times worse...

" I (22m) suck at confronting people. Even when I'm 100% in the right,  I'll still shake and my brain goes blank whenever I have to confront  somebody about something.

"Hey, all. I would like to share about my experience with anxiety. 

I have been feeling anxious since about two years now, since the lockdown began - overthinking stuff from the past.
I have been having anxiety attacks since three months now(i had them previously as well in the course of these two years, but none of the intensity i have been facing as of late). It first started when i was staring at my study book, and i felt like the book was staring right back at me - all the evil things imaginably possible - friends' facial expressions, like everything is closing down on me and making me feel very stressful.

It was horrible, i felt like puking, there was difficulty breathing.

It was followed by a similiar incident a month later.
I heard the news of a college student committing suicide because of their college's decision to hold offline exams.
(I'm a college student as well, and i was fearing writing the offline paper - i was fearing less marks and was very scared)
An hour or two later, when I had reached home, and started to think about that - my mind went crazy. The word 'suicide' kept ringing in my mind, and I kept puking.
It was a horrible experience, and it took a long time for me to calm down.
It was like everybody and everything was evil.
I did tell my mother about it, and i felt a temporary instant calm as if i needed that support , but then moments later i just got back to my negative thinking again.

The following week, i had my exams.
Every day I would have an exam, i would have an anxiety attack in the morning - a flood of irrational negative thoughts controlling my mind - anything imaginably possible from the ""evil faces of people"", that something could go wrong during the train journey. Ugh. 
It seemed like my mind was controlling me, and i wasn't able to be "" Normal"" or calm down.
It got to the point where it would affect me writing some of the papers - 2 of them to be specific.

The last paper i wrote, it was a horrifyingly stressful experience. The thought of people sitting behind me, ugh - it made me feel so anxious. I was trying to calm down during the entire paper. Luckily, i focused on something of silver colour and told myself its all good repeatedly until it sank into the subconscious and made me feel better.
Not that it lasted ^ , the anxious feeling just came back again later.
I feel it everyday. Well, luckily i don't have anxiety attacks everyday like during exam season,but more often than not, i get triggered with the same thoughts when i am in a social setting - people talking, loud music.


I don't know what to do about this. I have stuff i am stressed about - my relationship with my friends whom i don't think i really like and who made me feel ""bullied"" in the past, at certain instances - well, one of them, at least.
I'm stressed about my role in a youth-for-youth NGO where I opened up about my experience, and the constant ""push yourself out of your comfort zone"", the long zoom meetings - the feeling that i am being judged.

I'm stressed about whether people I meet are potentially ""Evil"" and""bully-like"" or not - how do i not overthink and just be friends with them?

 The friend request I just got on a chatting platform from an Internet friend whom i used to speak to 2-3 years ago. Maybe he's not my friend, what does he want from me? He probably knows my real name(i had shared, once, i think), and social media. What am i going to do? I'm so stressed.

I get stressed about random things.

I really need some love, support, and advice. 
I want to get past this, be in charge of myself, and be happy.

I appreciate you guys,
Thank you!

Cheers!",Anxiety

"More finding friends than dating, because if I ignore my looks, I really have nothing to offer. I am unemployed, I am from a poor family and the only luxury I can afford is the internet. But I do want friends. Especially because I have none right now, not in this city, and online friends are a fad anyway. And I figured tinder would be a good idea to use for finding friends. This is where the problems start for me.

I am ugly. Just downright ugly as fuck. Or it's something else. All I know is that I am unattractive as all hell to people. I can't afford good clothes either, I can't afford a healthy diet because we barely have enough money to afford carbs here. My teeth are going bad despite me being careful to brush them after meals and in general. I am a very hairy person, and to put salt on my wound, I am also balding. I keep losing more and more hair above my scalp and it just looks sad. Now, I don't need pity or anything. I just want to know if I did the right by deleting my tinder profile after swiping on a couple of girls, having figured out that the ""friends"" they're looking for are probably handsome people. The men must think I'm gay so I doubt any of them will swipe back either. Mind you, I tried to do it again shortly after but I deleted the profile again, five times so far.

If you want to see my photos, dm me and if you have time I'll send them via some other platform. Discord maybe... Other than that, I really just don't know how right I am about people and if I can find friends on tinder after all, despite being butt-ugly. You don't have to be gentle about this. Am I anxious or am I right? That is all.

And I am really not looking for pity. If you think the truth will hurt me, I already expect the worst, you can only make it better or you can confirm my would-be anxiety. Thank you all.",Anxiety

"Last night was day 4 of an extreme meltdown for me. Iâ€™m having SEVERE anxiety and intrusive/obsessive thoughts about my hair everyday to the point where I had to cover all the mirrors in my house, since a hairdresser bleached it all 2 months ago when I asked to not have bleach put on it, and itâ€™s broken off and thinned severely as well as the colour being ruined. About 4 days ago my scalp started getting this burning/prickly sunburn sensation (could be an allergic reaction to new shampoo, could be anxiety) but in my mind itâ€™s only heightened my paranoia and made me even more worried about potential hair loss.

I had to call 111 at 1am last night (UK) because I could no longer cope with anything, I was shaking uncontrollably and having heart palpitations and Iâ€™d been crying non stop since 2pm and this had gone on for 4 days with less than 3 hours sleep a night. Ended up on the phone to the crisis team and have been prescribed 15mg of diazepam for 2 days until I can next see my GP. 

My anxiety and paranoia is all focused on my hair right now. I had thin hair naturally, then lost about 25% of it after having covid and another 25% at least since this hairdresser damaged it. 

Now Iâ€™m paranoid that taking this diazepam is going to affect my hair. I obviously straight away googled it after taking the first 5mg dose and apparently it remains in your hair for 90 days ?! And thereâ€™s articles about hair loss from taking it. Now Iâ€™m even more paranoid and the obsession and meltdown cycle of thoughts is beginning again. 

I donâ€™t know if anyone here can help or advise on this matter or has experience with taking diazepam short term?",Anxiety
"Okay so basically let me start with this. I'm an anxious person and I've had panic attacks before and they appear once in a while but this time it's different and it's weird. It all started in Saturday at midnight. I was lying in my bed and suddenly that feeling of a panic attack was starting to kick in out of nowhere. The symptoms were similar to any other panic attack I had except that this one lasted for 2 hours. It was going away and coming back in literal intervals of minutes and it was weird. When it finally went away I just went to sleep. The next morning when I woke up I was fine for first 5-10 minutes then after I got up out of my bed it started again, the same feeling. And it was strong I was dizzy af, my heart was pounding and I felt weak. That same day I had to go to my grandma's for lunch. I already promised I'd come so I had to force myself to go to her. I was walking and the whole time it didn't stop. I was sitting there at her place and the anxiety and the same feeling of panic attack were lasting for hours. When I got home and when I laid down on my bed a bit it slowly went away but when I would get up it would start to kick in again. I went to bed normally that night and slept normally. And then again when I woke up today everything was fine I was literally lying in my bed for 2 hours and as soon as I got up to go to the toilet I had the same feeling kick in again. And now I'm lying on my bed again and thinking what the fuck is going on? I never had a panic attack lasting this long and I never felt something similar to this. I've thought of having a heart attack and I do all the time but everytime I had a panic attack before I always ended up being wrong and I've already been to emergency care twice for the same reason and it was panic attack every time. But this is something I've never experienced before can someone help me and tell me what should I do and is there a possibility that it really is heart related?

"Does anyone else get severe panic attacks while eating? If I have to sit down to dinner with family, or friends or whoever, or if I have to go out to eat, I will have a severe panic attack the ENTIRE time. Shaking my leg, biting my nails, extreme dizziness, shortness of breath. For easter yesterday I was with my bfs family at their house and for the entire dinner/dessert I could hardly eat, I felt nauseous, I was extremely dizzy and brain fogged, I couldnt pay attention to the conversation. I felt like I was going to pass out. Then once we were done, I felt a little better. 

This happens any time Iâ€™m eating with people, even my own family who Iâ€™m very comfortable with.

Mean while if I eat alone or just with my boyfriend, I feel fine. I donâ€™t have any eating disorders at the moment, I do have a history with it - Iâ€™m not sure what the trigger to this is? Food itself doesnâ€™t give me anxiety, I donâ€™t really pay attention to what I eat or that stuff.

Just wondering if anyone else experiences this, itâ€™s honestly really embarrassing because I can never really eat in front of people anymore and they always make a comment about it. Sometimes, theyâ€™ll think I donâ€™t like the food they made or something when thatâ€™s not the case.

"Burnt some toast, boiled instead of poached my eggs. Threw the toast away. Dumped the eggs and the water in the sink.

I know I've changed, but I'm not static. I quit using plastic bags, I hang my laundry up to dry, I opted for stability. I wish I could stop wanting what I need, but I can't seem to change that. You'd think that I would have learned my lesson by now that it's never going to happen. I can't make it happen. I learned that from Stephanie and all the things she said. She liked the attention I gave her. I felt like there was some possibility there, but I was wrong. Well, kinda. I thonk she expected me to make the first move even after the initial rejection. Like I was supposed to know that she had changed her mind. My mind has never been where it's supposed to be to get what I want. She should have made the first move, or should have made it more clearly understood. I'm going to be alone forever because I'm always expected to make the first move and I simply cannot afford to be wrong.",Anxiety

So lately i be having this panic attacks where life doesnt seem real anymore, is anyone having this kind of issue as well?",Anxiety
I just turned 21 a couple of weeks ago and Iâ€™m at university. Iâ€™ve been great for the past couple months but my anxiety attacks came back out of nowhere like Iâ€™ve never experienced them before.

This sounds silly, I know it sounds silly, butâ€¦ how do you ride a bus? Like you get on, sit down, my mom said you have to say where the stop you need to get off is or they may drive past it.

"So a little background on what's going on in my life. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety. I went on medication for a while, and was able to develop coping mechanisms and ween myself off of it. I have been able to manage it pretty well for the better part of two years. 

Now to the reason I am posting. Currently going through a really difficult time. In 2020 my girlfriend of almost two years got really sick and found a large lump in her neck. After a year of finally trying to figure out what it was in January of 2021 she had massive open chest surgery to remove a large tumor. She was diagnosed with cancer, and underwent treatment. We had moved in together the year before. Needless to say her family didn't help at all, and I ended up being the primary care taker. At the end of 2021 she finished treatment and is in remission. However are relationship dynamic changed completely. We also grew very dependent on each other in an unhealthy way. A lot of this was due to the fact that her family didn't help at all and I was left doing literally everything. 

We got to the point where she wanted to end the relationship. At the end of 2021 I left my contractor job before the end of my contract to take a full time position at a company that was basically a dream job. Thinking this would help us, and help me at the very least. March of this year I lost my job unexpectedly. And my girlfriend and I talked and we are deciding to split up. 

Currently have been applying to jobs but it feels very demoralizing. Not only that, but my girlfriends family sucks, and she is going through the emotions at realizing how shitty they are as she moves back with them. There are times where I want to get back together with her and times where I don't. And then rhe jobs I hear from are ones I don't really want but I have bills to pay. 

Not only that but the anxiety has come back hard. I pushed away a lot of mental concerns I had when Zhe got sick. I was looking to get a therapist within my old jobs health insurance network to help me deal with this, however I lost the job before that could happen. I workout, clean, and try to do my hobbies but the anxiety is bad. I'm paranoid about dying, worrying about being a stay at home child with no job leaching off of my parents. And I'm scared about my most recent relationship and if I am making a mistake. Needless to say the anxiety is turning into depression, and I'm wanting not live. 

I don't want to kill myself, I never had, but I always knew when my anxiety would get bad cause these thoughts would show up. Not to mention the physical effects are hitting me hard. I just need some advice or guidance that things will be okay.",Anxiety
"Hi everyone!

I am just starting buspirone for my anxiety disorder today. I also have a panic disorder and have tried several different meds with no luck (prozac, Wellbutrin, and Lexapro)

"hi, just want some advice here: iâ€™ve been struggling with low mood a lot recently, and itâ€™s been affecting my day to day productivity and social life.

but hereâ€™s the thing, i donâ€™t know if itâ€™s truly a mental health issue or if itâ€™s all just a normal phase of life that we all experience. my low points or anxieties often happen with a trigger. im doing something, bam, my mind wanders to some random obscure thing that i have been deeply insecure about / incidents in the past and i just think and think about it. sometimes my heart starts racing and it gets harder to catch my breath, sometimes i just feel empty and i lose focus. i find it hard to pull myself out of it. eventually i do, and i often use things to distract myself for a while, and after then i kind of forget about it and go about a normal day. and the next day or a few days later, i might have a similar thing happen. im not sure if itâ€™s just momentary anxiety and if everyone goes through these things, and maybe im just overthinking it.

i have considered multiple times to try and tell or ask someone, but every time just as iâ€™m about to do it, i hesitate and decide iâ€™ll do it later. i think my hesitation comes from the fact that i might just be overthinking and iâ€™m actually fine, but then people might think iâ€™m attention seeking or trying to fake an illness. i donâ€™t want to fake anything because it is a definite real and serious problem that many people are facing, but at the same time idk what to make of myself and my emotions right now. 

my parents donâ€™t believe in mental health problems, they just think itâ€™s a phase of sadness. where i am currently i know counselling services or just any services to talk about stuff are offered, but i fear losing my current position if any of the information is not kept confidential.

what should i do? am i just imagining things? because i truly donâ€™t want to invalidate the experiences of other people and i donâ€™t want to make it seem like iâ€™m faking because i am not. any advice is appreciated, thanks.",Anxiety

Long story short. I thrived in working from home the last few years and experience very little anxiety with zoom calls for work.

In that time frame I was promoted twice and now have a very important sounding title at my company.

Challenge is, this new role will require a ton of presenting, which I have been doing remotely very succesfully. I have my first in person presentation in 2.5 years in little over a week and honestly can't stop thinking there is no way in hell I can do it.

I'm honestly looking for any advice, at this point I am almost thinking I should ask for a demotion. I can't stop spiraling on this.

this has been becoming a very big problem over the past year.

"So I had my first ever unprovoked panic attack last night. Iâ€™m currently on vacation out of the country, not stressed out. Since January iâ€™ve had a routine, where I work and goto school 7 days a week right now, so this vacation is something I really needed and iâ€™ve never had a panic attack like this even while being overwhelmed and stressed back at home.

I spent the past few nights drinking, partying and doing coke (try to refrain from judging harshly please). I woke up yesterday hungover but fine, my partner and I hung out at home all day then went out to eat around 6pm and while I was eating my food I started feeling sick. Light headed, dizzy, my hands and face were tingling, I could catch my breath, my heart rate was super high and I felt like I was quite literally about to pass out and shit myself.

I went to the hospital because I was worried and all my vitals were normal, sugar levels, oxygen levels were fine, everything was fine!

Being that iâ€™m in a third world country with poor health care, I waited for a while to be seen and I managed to calm myself down. I went home pretty much fine. At around 9pm before bed I felt it all again and started crying, it was awful. I feel like I donâ€™t have any reason to stress or have anxiety right now. I donâ€™t know if it was residual feeling from partying or if the food made me sick and triggered anxiety. But whatever it was, it was awful. 

I woke this morning okay, but I have residual anxiety and iâ€™m scared iâ€™m gonna have another panic attack during this trip. If anyone can offer advice, help, anything, iâ€™m all ears. This was absolutely terrifying for me and I only have a few days left before I have to go back home and back to my routine, I donâ€™t want my panic attacks to ruin my few days of escapism.",Anxiety

Genuinely high, in my dream. I was ridiculously baked, exactly like it feels when Iâ€™m awake. I started waking up, and tried to sit up. I heard screaming outside. As I Daryl, my whole body tensed and started shaking. It felt like I was going to throw up. The screaming got louder and more voices came in, it was coming from all around me.

Iâ€™m prone to falling over quite clumsy whatever but lately it just keeps happening and happening and the more it happens the more frustrated I get wondering when the next time I fall over will be and Iâ€™m now scared to walk anywhere because Iâ€™m worried my next step will be my last. (I do still walk around but always always having this on my mind is overwhelming and stressful) so I also suffer from social anxiety and have trouble expressing myself and telling people what it is I want need should do whatever and when Iâ€™m put in a stressful situation I shud down and do/say whatever to get me out of that situation. Today my family wanted to go for a bush walk and me not being able to speak up for myself I just went along with it.

"iâ€™ve been friends with this girl â€œRâ€ for nearly four years now and weâ€™re very close along with my other friend (all 3 of us are 15) 
a few months ago she told us that the reason she always cancels plans and never goes out is because of her social anxiety and my other friend â€œMâ€ understood straight away and comforted her but i feel so horrible for not being able to understand, everytime she says sometning about her anxiety i never know how to respond and i feel so guilty for thinking that sheâ€™s just cancelling for no reason even when i genuinely know sheâ€™s struggling 

for another friends birthday last year we planned a trip to a restaurant and she lied saying that she couldnâ€™t come because her â€œmum was annoyedâ€. us three close friends were playing a truth game (separate from the other people that were coming for tbe birthday) and R said that she had a secret that we would get annoyed at, obviously we kept asking what it was but it felt as though she was attention seeking and in the end all she said was that sheâ€™d tell us â€œnext weekâ€ (the week after the birthday plans) 
when tbe time came aroumd we begged her to tell us and she told us that sheâ€™d lied about why she wasnâ€™t able to go to the birthday and that her mum wasnâ€™t actually annoyed and it was her social anxiety,, we told her we already knew and how it was a bit obvious and my other friend was really understanding and was even about to start crying for R but i just still couldnâ€™t understand why she would make us beg for her to come instead of telling us two that it was because of her anxiety and why she would make it some â€œmysterious secretâ€ if it was something she was struggling with 
it feels so tiring constantly having to reassure her again and again or keep changing plans to fit her even when sheâ€™s gonna cancel later on 

i keep trying to read up on other peopleâ€™s stories with social anxiety and i do really care about her but it feels so draining when every plan we make is cancelled even when we try make it as comfortable as we can for her and when iâ€™m constantly having to tiptoe around her
iâ€™ve always done whatever she asks me to and gone with her everywhere but she never does the same for me and it just feels like i care sm more about her than she does for me e.g when i want to get an easier journey home from school rather than take the long journey on her bus, she gets annoyed at me and passive aggressive so i just end up getting her bus even if iâ€™m tired but she would never do the same for me 

when i tell her that iâ€™m upset about something or struggling mentally she just ignores my messages or gives a really dry response so iâ€™ve just given up on being able to talk to her when iâ€™m upset and it makes me wonder why i donâ€™t just do the same for her 

i just donâ€™t know how to respond to her because i care for her but it never feels like she does for me but i donâ€™t want to make her feel bad at all and i feel like iâ€™ve spent the last few years not being able to do anything for myself because she doesnâ€™t like to do anything but sheâ€™s my closest friend and i want to be able to understand and help her with her anxiety

"I (22f) have suffered from severe social anxiety for as long as I can remember. Meeting new people is agonizing for me and I have a never-ending list of more specific, equally stupid things I mentally and physcially can't force myself to do (speaking to strangers on the phone, ordering a sandwich at Subway, opening email responses, going on lines with cashiers instead of self checkout at the supermarket, etc.)

When I'm in a situation that triggers my anxiety, I can't force myself to do what I need to, no matter how hard I try. It's like I'm paralyzed every time. I've only had one long-term friend in my life (she pursued a friendship when I was too anxious to) and she gets mad at me all the time for self-sabotaging. I try so hard to be normal and not to act like a freak, but she tells me I'm ruining my own life. 

I'm entering my final year of college in the fall, and I still have no friends there. Every time I have to speak up in class, I get so anxious I want to throw up. I've had to go with randomly assigned roommates every semester because they all get weirded out by my reticence and move somewhere else as soon as possible. My family and I have a bad relationship because they've emotionally abused me and gaslighted me about my anxiety ever since I started showing signs of it. 

I've never spoken to a therapist because I'm still on my parents' insurance and they refuse to pay for it, but I know I need help. My mother took away my phone, my car keys, and told me I can't leave the house for the rest of the summer because I screwed up a job interview the other day. I've been in a little bit of a depressive episode since (I've also suffered from those for quite some time) and no one in my house will talk to me. 

I guess I just don't know where to go from here. My anxiety has never been worse and I feel like my existence is pretty worthless. Any advice or anxiety managing tips or anything would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.",Anxiety
"I have pretty bad anxiety bouts like once a year. When they get this bad Iâ€™m almost bed ridden for a week or two until my meds kick in. But during that period waiting for my meds to kick in, sometimes Iâ€™ll be trying to sleep and my brain is RACING through the most random thoughts and it almost feels like itâ€™s not even me thinking them. Theyâ€™re not really bad thoughts or anything. It just really kinda feels like Iâ€™m not the one thinking them. Almost like Iâ€™m dreaming while trying to fall asleep I guess? Then when I notice it Iâ€™ll get anxious about it then be awake and get end up getting shitty sleep. Itâ€™s really only during a bad bout of anxiety and dissociation or derealization. And really Only when I close my eyes to try and sleep Has anyone else ever experienced this?",Anxiety
"My mom wouldnâ€™t get me the vaccine cuz sheâ€™s against it. I didnâ€™t worry too much anyways. I have covid now and Iâ€™m just scared of dying, sore throat, cough, and runny nose is what I got say 3 or 4 and whenever I cough my chest kinda aches or my deep throat hurts.

"I have a doctors appointment today and itâ€™s like 30 minutes away and I HAVE to go. I am having so many health problems, I need testing, and I just literally have to go.

My problem is that I have been basically bedridden for the past 3 weeks because when I start to move around I get super nauseous. I have a debilitating phobia of vomiting and so I am TERRIFIED of trying to make it to the doctors. I tried to go to urgent care yesterday and I literally couldnâ€™t do it. 

I am so terrified that being in a car is going to make things worse. And that having to sit up and move around and everything at the doctors is going to make me sick. 

I am freaking out and I know that the fear makes it worse. I canâ€™t even tell if the nausea is real or just because Iâ€™m terrified. 

Help :( 

The only nausea meds I have are promethazine and Nauzene but promethazine makes me drowsy and the Nauzene I havenâ€™t tried in a long time because it started making me dizzy months ago and I have gastritis so Iâ€™m scared to put it into my stomach. Literally the only remedy I have is seabands and those barely do anything.

I am losing my mind. I am absolutely not willing to throw up to get to this appointment. If I throw up I am turning around and going home. It is literally not worth it to me. I would rather do another month of bed rest.

But I know that I need to go to this appointment. Iâ€™ve lost too much weight, Iâ€™ve been undereating for two years and it got really bad since my stomach issues started a few months ago. I need an EKG. I havenâ€™t pooped in 2 weeks. I feel like crap 100% of the time and Iâ€™m not brave enough to take my antidepressant because Iâ€™m scared itâ€™s going to make me sick. I just wish the doctor had an opening in their closer office sooner, and not the one so freaking far away.",Anxiety

"\[Male, 36 years old.\]

I had bouts of PAC's in the past (had them checked by a Holter Monitor and recorded) but they were not frequent and (at least it felt like) pretty much random. They occured at rest, most of the time. I accepted the situation, just felt bad whenever I had them.

Now since a day or 9-10 I have much more of them and they seem to happen when the stress / nervousness is high. That's bad news to me, because I have an anxiety disorder and in stressful times (like this period), I am often nervous about many things. Meetings, doctor appointments, etc. This period I had them almost daily.

I had to go to the doctor 3 times this week, and all 3 times I got 4-5 ectopics in a row the moment I sat down in his chair. Two days ago I was underway to a friend, I get out of the car and boom, there we go again.

It seems to happen at the moment that the nervousness / physical stress has reached it's peak and is about to come down.

Anyway, this is killing me mentally. Because it means that, everytime I will do something that will make me nervous (many things), I am pretty much guaranteed to also have to deal with ectopic heartbeats now.

Damn, this is the perfect recipe to develop agora-phobia and never leave the house again. The stress and panic attacks were already bad enough, but I could deal with them. Kind of. I always tried to push through. But having your heat beat irregulary everytime you are nervous, makes me even more nervous of being nervous.

Fuck me, this is really the last thing I needed on my way out of this. I had an ECG today by the way (no ectopics during recording) and will have a Echocardiogram somewhere in the upcoming weeks, to see if they have a 'serious' cause. Until then I'm kind of in the dark, although I'm pretty sure that the underlying reason is stress built up in the body.

Just wanted to vent and share my desperation. Any help is appreciated.",Anxiety
"Hi all, Iâ€™ve been working a job I absolutely love for the past 6 months now. My managers are great and I respect the hell out of them.

"I have been on Zoloft (25mg) since last summer and I have been doing good with less anxiety and depression.

"I have been struggling with anxiety for the past few months and it has recently gotten very worse. My anxiety has led to sever burnout recently. Iâ€™m not able to enjoy the things I like or work towards my goals due to this burnout, which is adding to my anxiety.

I have been going for therapy, and working on myself but anytime I make any progress I realize that Iâ€™m all alone in this fight and have no one to really talk to. None of my friends or family members truly understand me, and Iâ€™m having to deal with an anxious mind all the time. I know what I need to do exactly to fight the anxiety demon, but the thought of fighting this alone seems to be killing my motivation.

lately my anxiety has been at an all time high and iâ€™ve been crying at work every single day. i work at a grocery store as a personal shopper and whenever it starts getting crowded and too many people start asking me questions i start getting overwhelmed and start crying. i mean itâ€™s one person after the other walking up to me and asking me for stuff. itâ€™s gotten to the point where iâ€™m thinking about quitting because itâ€™s just too much to handle. my mom says iâ€™m a baby over it but damn iâ€™m just not used to that much social interaction and then the customers get upset if you donâ€™t know something. itâ€™s just frustrating and iâ€™m dreading my shift later.,Anxiety

"On June 3 I have a fashion show to do for my former high school.
Basically when I was in school we created some dresses, and on June 3 we have to walk with those,in font of a lot people.
My former fashion teacher a while ago asked me and my best friend to partecipate, my bff said yes and so did I. (Because I would NEVER be able to by myself because of my very strong anxiety)
Everything was going well until a few minutes ago..my bff calls me saying that maybe she got a job and doesn't know if she will be at the fashion show.
As soon as I heard that sentence I felt like a hole has formed in my stomach. I know it seems like nothing, but my mom wants so much for me to do this fashion show but as much as I want to make her happy I just can't do it. It would be a constant of panic attacks because I don't know anyone, plus what makes it all worse is having to walk ALONE in front of so many people who will be staring at me.
IT'S MY WORST NIGHTMARE, I swear to you, I feel like crying and my hands are already sweating.
I also had the evil thought ""let's hope she doesn't get the job so she can walk with me"", I know is horrible to say but I'm in so much panic rn.

My job will be translations from English to the Slovak language. I passed their test so I think I have everything that I need for this job, but I am a weak speaker (according to myself but maybe I just lack confidence) and very nervous.

"Lately, I've been focusing on practicing gratitude and positivity, especially in my daily journal entries. For the most part, it seems to be working, as my mood has definitely improved from where it was just a few days ago. I don't feel comfortable coming to any hard conclusions about whether or not this practice'll work in the long run, and I still want to see a therapist to deal with my mental health issues in a more professional format, but as far as ""home remedies"" go, this seems to be a step in the right direction.

However, while I definitely feel just a little happier, I still struggle to accept that fact. I have a hard time being okay with being happy because I have a hard time seeing happiness as legitimate for me.

There's a lot in the world to be upset about. Even disregarding the tragedy in Texas yesterday, there're the constant threats (imagined or not) of gun violence, police brutality, political unrest/upheaval, general hatred/bigotry, civil war, *world* war, pandemics present and future, climate change, and so much more. To be happy in the face of all of that feels disingenuous and even selfish to me, as bizarre as that may sound. This evening, me, my younger sister, my mother, and my father all had a family dinner. It was a pleasant experience, especially since I'd just come home from college a little over a week ago, but I can't shake the feeling that something was *wrong*. It felt *wrong* to have a *good* day while so many people around the world are potentially having the worst day of their lives.

I think that a lot of this also has to do with my anxiety and inability to accept uncertainty. The future is unknown for everyone, so having confidence not only in myself but in my choices feels weird. I keep waiting for something awful to happen that shakes everything familiar to me up. For example, in the United States, we're currently in midterm season. I'm incredibly anxious for November of this year because that's when we'll know what the next Congress lineup will look like, and considering how tense and frayed the current state of U.S. politics is, I'm half-expecting some sort of violent rebellion or uprising that'll tear the country apart. It's hard to be happy in the face of fears like that.

I hope that I did a good job of elaborating on my state of mind. Please share any advice that you may have. Also, please let me know if any of what I wrote violates ""Rule 8"" of the sub. I'm not here to advocate for anyone or anything. I truly don't want to cause a debate or any drama in the comments. Thanks!",Anxiety
Iâ€™ve been taking vyvanse for a few years now but i recently got prescribed 1mg of ativan to combat PMS due to experiencing severe anxiety  for a few days before and after my period. My doctor told me to only take the ativan on bad days which iâ€™m okay with because i didnâ€™t really want to take anything that would take a long time to work and also because the anxiety comes in spurts.

"I wake up feeling pretty happy, i do all my morning stretches, meditation have my breakfast and then i open the curtains get changed and the anxiety just jumps on immediately i start to feel dizzy/ off balance and depersonalised and it feels shit, it will gradually get worse &amp; worse as the day comes on and by 7:00 once ive had my i have a cold shower, meditate and do some yoga and i feel so much better, feel really happy. I think its something to do with all my viewpoints how i view the day, i kinda dread the day so i think my brain kinda feels like it can only relax during the night time.

I keep myself active by going for walks and bike rides but when im back it just kicks in.

Just that stretch during the day is so tough, the depersonalisation is the worst part it feels like im gonna collapse or just fade away it feel so scary with my health anxiety . The weather has been shit recently as well, all overcast so that aint helping matters haha.

I think a good first step would be to start having early bed times ive been sleeping like rubbish and ive been exercising tons, fatigue is only gonna make me feel worse naturally.",Anxiety
"I recently got a job in my hobby (fav sport) Before joining my girlfriend has been suffering with severe anxiety and depression which I was doing my best to be there for her and help as much as I could. Im ashamed to say this but I was finding it hard to deal with. I struggle myself with being anxious and find changes in routine incredibly difficult.  Once the job started some of my hours were changed which caused my anxious thoughts to hit the roof! I was crying before during and after work. After two weeks I was alone working and the negative thoughts were tearing me apart. I asked my boss if I could go home early to clear my head. That evening I was told to have a day off to clear my head. The following day I received a message detailing that my probation had been terminated. 

Whilst at the job I felt like I hated it and the tasks I was doing were mundane and not enjoyable but I cannot differentiate between anxious thoughts and rational ones. I don't blame them for letting me go. They probably wanted someone composed and I was a mess.

Okay so I suffer from GAD and panic attacks for many years I'm currently in therapy and medication and have been on employment and support allowence UK for a few years now and I've always had appointments over the phone even pre Covid as I have alot of trouble with social interactions and public places it's a bad trigger of mine so last week my work coach that I have as I fall into the category of future work prep well he dropped a bombshell on me that I need to come to a face to face appointment... No clue why as I tried to explain about my issues which they do know about anyway but I feel like I'm being pushed into a corner here.. and feel like they are forcing me to come to this appointment when I have no means of transport and nobody to support me on that day.. but when I've explained to them they don't seem to give a damn.. I've asked to continue the phone appointments but in his words my work coach he feels like it's unnecessary and that I should be okay to come to this appointment.. like am I wrong in feeling pissed off about this as this person who has never met me.. is basically saying I'm fine you can come the appointment even tho it will end up making me very ill.

"Does anyone get this? I'm on Lexapro so my anxiety has decreased. It has allowed me to do more things now, that used to cause my anxiety before. I still get anxiety when I do these things, but it's at a more manageable level. 

That said, I'm noticing as I do more things (while I experience those low levels of anxiety) my anxiety will increase *because* I'm doing so much successfully. My brain considers every time I do something that used to cause me high levels of anxiety successfully as a one time scenario.

"I (28f) have always been a very anxious person, since I was a little kid. I've learned to manage it through therapy, coping mechanisms, and antidepressants (although I'm no longer medicated, I wasn't a big fan). So it's managed but it's still always there, under the surface. 

A few times a year I'll go through a particularly bad phase of anxiety usually triggered by something in my personal life or more often by stuff related to my job. As of the past week I've been in one of those phases due to all these important and daunting work tasks I need to get done. I'm experiencing all of the usual symptoms: loss of appetite, nausea, sweating, difficulty sleeping, etc. But I'm also experiencing a new one this time - I am SO. FREAKING. GASSY. Oh my word it's ridiculous. And it's uncontrollable. These belches are coming out of me without any warning and they are LOUD. It's all I can do to keep my mouth shut at work so they don't escape out of me. Not only that but...the farts. I've never been a particularly flatulent lady. Even my BF who I live with has only heard me fart once or twice. I've just never really felt the need to do it much lol. He told me last night I very very loudly farted in my sleep at least a few times. He was worried there was something wrong with me lmao. I'm guessing that since I haven't been eating much due to the lack of appetite I just have a lot of air trapped inside of me.  

This isn't something I'm particularly worried about. If anything it's giving me a lot of comedic relief in this time of extreme anxiety that I'm experiencing. But does anyone else experience this ever? This is definitely a new ""symptom"" for me (if you can even call it a symptom) and it's definitely directly related to my stress and anxiety.

"Hey There, has anyone experienced an elevated heart rate when recovering from COVID? I tested negative a week ago but my heart rate has been elevated since. Resting is between 90-100 and when I walk around it gets up to 120-140.

This is really triggering my panic attacks and I dont know how to cope. My doctor ran tests on my heart and said this is normal after COVID,  but I really can't imagine this going on for weeks or months. As you can imagine,  it's exasperating my anxiety and making my heart rate worse. I've been missing work because of this.

And advice or words of support?? ðŸ’”",Anxiety
"Basically, I took 2 paracetamol tablets (400 mg), then forgetting about 2 - 3 hours earlier, I took 2 paracetamol tablets. The box says to take them 4 hours apart, which I accidentally did not. This is the first time I have ever done this. Will I be ok??",Anxiety

Iâ€™m having this problem for several years and it really bothering me now.
Iâ€™m pretty sure I have anxiety problems although they are manageable most of the times, the thing is that sometimes I have this random Deja vu feeling that leaves me disoriented, extremely anxious and confused for like 20 minutes.
Itâ€™s significant to me but I can hide it from other people.
Although one time I was having hard time speaking (still was able to).

I donâ€™t know if that anxiety, migraine or epilepsy.

It happens every 3 months or something like that.",Anxiety
"I dont have any diagnosed disorder but my anxiety is making me a miserable person anymore. I can't go to school without changing outfits 10 times because I'm scared of what people will think . I'm scared that all my friends will leave me constantly,I'm scared that they talk about me .I'm scared that I'm too loud or too quiet ,I'm afraid to tell people about my feelings about I'm scared they will think I'm dramatic or lying for attention.

"It's like my body used numbness as a defend mechanism to shut me from having another panic attack, now i don't feel anything, i still have extreme anxiety where i can't sleep or i can't eat but at least i don't get panic attacks .

I can't even taste food anyway, i can't smell anything, no I'm not sick, i just don't feel alive, i don't feel anything, I'm stucked in a constant state of anxiety, it's like I'm literally in hell burning alive, my mind is producing so much adrenaline, if i close my eyes and try to test i can't, it's like I'm running while laying on bed that's how fast my heart rate is.

I'm literally in hell ,i miss being just depressed, atleast i was able to cry or eat or sleep when i only had depression, anxiety is the worst thing I've ever witnessed",Anxiety

"TW: suicide of family member

Posted originally on r/relationships and they suggested I come here to your lovely community 

Iâ€™ve been in a relationship with a man I deeply love for almost a year now. We live together, but our schedules allow us to have plenty of alone time and I maintain an active social life outside our relationship. I have a great job. All good, right?

My relationship anxiety is ruining it for me. I was married before. Got married very young - think like just over legal drinking age - to a man I moved abroad for (US to UK). Our relationship was, to put it mildly, as shitshow. He liedâ€¦a lot. About money. About other women. Anything. Made me feel crazy and like I had a really tenuous grasp on reality. Like I was a monster. And maybe I was at some points? There are certainly things I couldâ€™ve done better. 

I didnâ€™t realise how abusive (I think thatâ€™s an appropriate use of the word) it was until my mom came to visit and she just broke down seeing how deferential and withdrawn Iâ€™d become. He left me for someone else not long after. 

We got divorced. I did therapy. Had another intense, unhealthy relationship that again made me realise I have shit to sort out. My childhood was pretty uneven - both my parents were diagnosed with mental disorders. They hit us sometimes 
, my mom definitely caused some emotional scars. But, they were also awesome and loving and I have lots of good memories, too. My little brother died when I was 19. It wasnâ€™t an accident. Basically, Iâ€™ve been through shit. I go to therapy. Iâ€™m trying to get myself right. I stayed single for over a year. 

Anyway, if you managed to make it through all the waffle Iâ€™m here now - in love and making myself miserable. Have you been there? How did you cope? Iâ€™m in therapy but maybe thereâ€™s something else that helps too? He is so understanding but this is like an enormous burden for us both. I donâ€™t want to mess this up. Itâ€™s like..the healthiest, warmest thing and Iâ€™m not keen to give it up. 

tldnr: Iâ€™ve had a pretty silly life and itâ€™s accompanying anxiety is crushing me and my relationship. In therapy. What else?",Anxiety
"I was really unhappy in my country. The only thing worth being there for is my family. I left for another country for better mental health and for a better future.
My parent has not taken it well and is emotionally blackmailing me. She says life is not worth living anymore. That I don't love them etc. 

I tried to tell her that I am happier here being able to do things I love and fulfulling. But it is now eating me up. I was fine before she started the crisis. Now I'm anxious again.",Anxiety
What works for you to get back to a normal sleeping pattern?,Anxiety
"Confidence is 75% of the battle in life. Jobs, partners, friends, etc. it's all down to being confident. You may not actually know what you're doing but being confident will convince all those around you. 

With anxiety, you will be constantly doubting yourself, thinking you can't do it. Trying to talk yourself out of daunting situations, and as such struggling to grow as a person.

It can be hard for people to understand how much of a disadvantage this puts you in. It's harder to make friends and socialise, date, work, and even things like phoning the doctor, driving, and shopping can feel like too much to handle. 

Constant anxiety is so incredibly unhealthy for your  psyche yet people without anxiety often can't understand this. Instead we appear a bit shy, maybe even lazy, but they don't know what it feels like to have this affliction",Anxiety
"Am in the final year of Highschool, and I was a good student upto my 10th Grade, but ever since learning became online, I fell out on studies, and in my final year all exams are taken in person, My parents are sending me abroad for studies and have already spent a lot of money on admissions, applications and visa, My final exams are held in two terms and my first one went terribly, Ever since then I got severe anxiety for the past 3 months
To the point that I couldnâ€™t sleep days on end

My second term of exams is currently going on and they didnâ€™t go that well either, the anxiety is eating away at me and not letting me study

I keep on thinking about the future that if my Admission gets revoked because of bad marks, my parents will be distraught and what would i ever do after that

I know this is not even nearly as big as the problems people have, but this is eating me away to the point everything is starting to seem bleak and pointless to me and I have become a lifeless body at this point.",Anxiety
"I've been taking Lexapro for six years now. The past few weeks have been stressful and weird, and I've forgotten to take my meds several times. The worst streak started yesterday, and if I miss too many days I have nightmares.

"Feeling physically sick when I frantically internet search or think of the possible causes of any single pain in my body, thus making the phenomenon worse, and leading to nausea and lightheadedness. This is the case with any problem, however small.

"Just wondering what temp everyone sleeps at here and how that comes into play with anxiety?

I myself run pretty hot and get very restless if the temp is anything over 23C (73.4F).

Most optimal for me would be in the 16-18C range (61-64F). I just feel that way I can wrap myself in a cocoon of blankets and fall asleep way easier.

I find it also helps with mitigating my anxiety since my body is more calm.",Anxiety

"Hi everyone,
Long story short, Iâ€™m having sudden, severe anxiety on vacation with my boyfriend which is basically this constant buzzing/dreading/inescapable claustrophobic feeling in my body and head that seems to just never go away. Iâ€™ve had very mild anxiety in the past (frequent worrying about death, extreme nervousness in social situations, unfounded health fears) but those have all been just worries and thoughts, nothing like this constant, sudden physical feeling that wonâ€™t go away and makes me feel so trapped and scared in my own head.

Anyway, I was thinking of trying CBD to help but worried it might make it worse. Iâ€™ve found with weed, sometimes it causes the same kind of restlessness and claustrophobia in my head that Iâ€™m feeling right now. I think I tend to hyperfocus on every little process in my body and want to feel in control, so thatâ€™s why weed sometimes messes with me. But does straight CBD do that to you too? Or does it just relax you?

Thanks!",Anxiety
"i wake up on a verge of a panic attack everyday. first thing i do when i wake up is explode the toilet bc of my anxiety messing with my stomach over the night. i cant pin point the cause , i always feel like an impending doom feeling as if im goin to have a heart attack . i take prozac but it seems to get me only more antsy and jittery, maybe thats cuz i havent got used to them ? idk. i think i just need a xanax . these feelings have been with me for since 2018. getting tired of this feeling :( i havent felt normal in years . i wish i can wake up and feel good instead of a constant worry , how does one cope if this feeling will be with me for life. i never open up so im trying to hear other stories or help so i dont feel alone",Anxiety

"i dont really have debilitating anxiety to the point that it affects my life. my anxiety is just mainly obsessive/intrusive thoughts that are usually on my mind if im not distracted with something else. so far no doctor/therapist ive spoken to has recommended me to take meds, but im just curious whether taking SSRIs would help me for example. since i dont have physical symptoms would it also work on reducing these thoughts?",Anxiety
"Hi all,
Iâ€™m on vacation with my boyfriend now in the UK. I normally have mild anxiety (just general worrying about dying or extreme nervousness in social situations) however since weâ€™ve arrived Iâ€™m suddenly experiencing severe anxiety in my whole body. I feel shaky and dizzy and like thereâ€™s something buzzing in my body and brain constantly. Itâ€™s not even a sense of fear grounded in anything in particular, which I think is what makes it most scary because I feel like I donâ€™t know how to fix it. I think I might have picked up some kind of stomach bug in the airport and I think the fear of puking/fainting (I have a history of fainting) made things worse. But now my stomach seems to be better but the anxiety is EXTREME and non-stop. I feel like I canâ€™t do anything or even think about anything besides it. I feel like Iâ€™m going crazy and this is inescapable. I hadnâ€™t been sleeping well until last night when I finally got a full nightâ€™s sleep. But this morning when I woke up, the first thing I thought was â€œIs the feeling back?â€ and Iâ€™ve been feeling it ever since, like the fear of the feeling is triggering it but I donâ€™t know how to stop that. I think the stress of the time change and wanting to make sure I make the most of the vacation and being out and outgoing after a pretty anti-social, indoors time for the last two years in the pandemic has made it worse, since Iâ€™m usually a home-body. But I wouldnâ€™t mind being tired or even stressed if I could just get rid of this constant, panicked feeling. I feel like Iâ€™m so alone in my head and so trapped even when my boyfriend helps me and Iâ€™m so scared that somethingâ€™s wrong with me and Iâ€™ll never feel normal again. I donâ€™t even feel like myself right now. And itâ€™s been constant too for the last few days. Anyone have any suggestions for how I can quiet this incredibly painful feeling and feel like a person again??? Or how I can try to stop thinking about it to have some peaceful moments anyway? Or could it be more serious because I have the stomach problems also and it came on so suddenly? If I went to a doctor, would they even be able to do anything? Itâ€™s just the worst Iâ€™ve ever felt in my whole life and I feel like thereâ€™s nothing anyone can do to help, which makes me more scared.",Anxiety
"Sorry for the long post .. but here I go. Iâ€™m 34. Iâ€™ve dealt with generalized anxiety disorder since I was in the 2nd grade. It got so bad I left public school at 13. In the past Iâ€™ve had jobs but couldnâ€™t keep any long term because I would leave due to anxiety. There was a time in my teens where I swear I went a few years living anxiety free. I lived a â€œnormal â€œ life. I was carefree. It seems like the older I get the worse itâ€™s getting. Anyways. Hereâ€™s the point to this post. 
The beginning of April I was driving home and had to pull over cause I was getting anxious. I was maybe 5 minutes from home but my body shut down. I hit the sos button on my car and within 10 minutes I had paramedics with me. I have only called once before 10 years ago so this isnâ€™t a normal thing that happens. I donâ€™t know why but in that moment I thought I was going to die. I sat with them for 15 min and I just couldnâ€™t calm down. Thankfully one of the firefighters/ emts drove me and my truck home. I calmed down the second I got in the passenger seat. Then a couple weeks later my bf of 13 years had to leave at 10pm to take a friend to the hospital cause he was thought he was having  having a heart attack. Totally fine. Shouldnâ€™t have been an issue. But the minute he left I felt horrible , crippling anxiety come over me. I called my mom ( lives 45 min away ) and sheâ€™s usually able to talk me down and Iâ€™m fine. This wasnâ€™t the case. I was in full panic mode and no matter what I did the anxiety was getting worse. I texted my bf and he was waiting at the hospital with his friend and they were about to put a stint in his heart and he wanted to be there for him. I spent 2 hours in a panic. Nothing was helping. I was convinced I was dying. At around midnight I called my grandma lives right next door) and she came over. She prayed with me and she stayed for about an hour. Finally at around 2:30 I crashed. 

Ever since those 2 horrible attacks I havenâ€™t really left my house. I have went to a nursery and to get lunch a couple times but Iâ€™m too scared to drive and really do anything. Iâ€™m in constant fear that Iâ€™m going to have another attack so I stay home and I worry Iâ€™m going to become even more home bound. 

Has anyone dealt with anxiety like this and got better ???  Sorry for the long , Iâ€™m sure confusing rant.",Anxiety
"Very often at night I find myself reliving parts of my past abusive relationship. Writing this gives me anxiety. I was cheated on multiple times, mainly emotionally. I was gaslighted even when I had strong evidence of the wrong doings. Iâ€™ve caught her in multiple lies. I have a gut feeling she even went to the lengths of cheating on me physically but she always denied it. Itâ€™s sad because with all that I know with the way she denied it Iâ€™ll never know truthfully. Now thatâ€™s a horrible feeling. You see I also donâ€™t know how to trust anymore and thatâ€™s even scarier. That gives me these panic attacks. What if I find someone I truly want to be with but I just canâ€™t trust them? Iâ€™m not sure if I can love someone that deeply again and not be taken advantage of. Itâ€™s been almost half a year since the clean break but will it always be like this? It makes me not want to ever date again. Iâ€™d rather get my do hookups than ever date again. The crazy thing is though is that Iâ€™ve always hated the idea of hooking up personally. I have no qualms with anyone who does it, itâ€™s just not for me. I feel very alone.",Anxiety
"I have been feeling quite anxious and burn out recently from work. Work messages come to me almost any time of the week. I have worked for three years already.

I also feel quite sad that my grandmas are not in good condition now. One of my grandparent she is unable to walk well now and I feel quite emo when recalling what she told me. She said she is just passing every day and waiting to die ðŸ˜….

"&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I have anxiety issues paired with codependency and yes I am seeking therapy before y'll start attacking me. I am going to talk about this in my therapy session today but until then I want to know how to deal with this.

My (26M) boyfriend had gone on a work trip to another country for 10 days. Last night he returned and I went to the airport to receive him and we drove back to his place, where I stayed over. In the morning while he was browsing instagram randomly and we were seeing random videos on his phone, he went on to his search and there was girl's username. Now the thing is the first time I am in a relationship. I do not how I feel about him talking to or adding other girls, but right now I do not feel so good about it. In the past and my childhood my mother and father both have cheated on each other, which is why I also have high insecurity and trust issues. My parents are still together in a messed way but it became our new normal and nobody speaks about it in the family. I do not want that to happen to me. Despite them cheating, I want to be able to trust someone. He is not aware of the cheating thing and neither I am going to tell anyone I know about this because I am ashamed of it. I do not want his opinion to change for my parents. Whatever they are going through they are still my parents after all.

I know this is deep rooted and I have started therapy three weeks ago, to address this. But today when I saw a girl's name on his Instagram search, I immediately shut myself off. He could sense that something was off. I went off to my house and have been ever since then trying to process how I feel. How does somebody deal with this? Do they confront their partner about it without sounding so insecure? Slip it casually to get over that thought?

TLDR: I (25F) saw on his (26M) Instagram's search of a girl (22F) he looked up.",Anxiety
