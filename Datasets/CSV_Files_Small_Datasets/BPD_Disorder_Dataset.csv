"Hello fellow friends üòÑ

I'm on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.

There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?

For me I will first become silent and blame myself, ""maybe if I"" or ""If I only"", ""maybe he's just not having it today"", ""maybe I simply don't get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding"". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don't know whether you guys get to experience this as well? 

I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:

""The maximum amount of rage. it's like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It's the point people don't recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It's disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn't even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she's completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I'm shaking as I'm writing this because I know it's still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone's life. I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I didn't, but I know I shouldn't see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he's using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn't get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don't work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.""

To put things in perspective: Normally I'm a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should ""stand up for myself more.""

So yeah, to end this long rant with the clear questions I started it with: ""There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?""",bpd_disorder
"My [F20] bf [M20] told me today (after I said ‚ÄúI just wish I could be better for you‚Äù) that he likes me for who I am, and that I don‚Äôt need to be better for him. And after crying about how I don‚Äôt think anyone has ever said that to me before, I realized that I don‚Äôt know who I am.

"Okay, I‚Äôm about to open up about many things I‚Äôve done in my past that I‚Äôm not proud of. I‚Äôm not that person anymore. In these stories I was 17 and immature as fuck. I‚Äôm now 22 with a total different take on life.

I became best friends with this girl in 2017. We were both 17 at the time. We did everything together. We smoked weed daily. Sleepovers. Longboard together. Did acid together. We did everything together. We would die for each other.

Once we robbed our mutual friends house. We stole $200 from the girls dad. I ended up telling the girl and paid her back Bc I felt bad. 

Once we robbed a building and made out with $1,500 and never got caught.

Once we robbed a house we thought was someone we knew who just robbed us. Turned out it was a fake address he gave us and we robbed a random house. We never got caught.

Once we got arrested for robbing cars off acid while drunk. We caught some fines for that. 

We did a lot of sneaky bad shit together. After the last time we got caught, we stopped doing all that shit. We were doing really well. 

Long story short this is how our friendship ended.‚¨áÔ∏è

I was dating a super toxic dude and she‚Äôd tell me to leave him all the time. Finally I left him. We went to a party and had a fucking blast. The next day I went home and sent her this whole long text about how her and her bf were toxic and that they should break up. 

She didn‚Äôt take that lightly. I don‚Äôt blame her I wasn‚Äôt nice about it and it came out of no where. We were literally fine the day before.

I ended up switching schools and she started rumors that I wanted to break them up because I wanted her boyfriend and he told everyone I tried to kiss him. Not true. He didn‚Äôt like me because she spent more time with me than him and he voiced that all the time.

Then I got with my current boyfriend HERE IT IS... I got my boyfriend to rob her house. I specifically said he could only take weed related things. No money and can‚Äôt steal from her mom. So he took two bongs and 8gs of weed. She assumed it was me right away Bc who else knew her window didn‚Äôt shut. I finally admitted to her like 5/6 months later during our graduation. When I told her, it looked like she wanted to kill me but she kept her cool on the outside.

Let‚Äôs call my best friend that I had my bf rob - Katrina
Let‚Äôs call the girl Katrina and I robbed $200 from her parents - Yazra

Yazra wasn‚Äôt mad at Katrina or Me for robbing her parents. She accepted out apology. Yazra invited me and Katrina to her graduation party. We both show up and there I gave Katrina $300 to make up for what I had robbed. She didn‚Äôt seem happy. I don‚Äôt blame her. 

It‚Äôs been 5ish years since 2017 when we were best friends. We are friends on Facebook but we don‚Äôt talk. 

Last week I shared a post that says ‚Äúif you were ever my closet friend at one point just know I think about you from time to time and hope you‚Äôre doing great things in life‚Äù and she heart reacted my post

4 days ago I saw her at the liquor store. She was right behind me in line. I was consumed in anxiety and couldn‚Äôt even bring myself to say hi or even look at her. When we first saw each other we both looked shook and then quickly looked/walked away. She also said nothing. 

I really really want to be her friend again. I cry over her all the time. I vent about her in my journals. I write letters that I think I would one day send to her but never do. 

Do you think she forgave me?

Do you think she misses me?

Do you think she could give me a chance again?

Do you think she‚Äôs even capable of trusting me again?

Don‚Äôt you think she could forgive me after everything we did to other people?

Do you think I should try to message her?

I apologized 100 times back in 2018 during graduation and at the graduation party and repaid her.

What should I say if I do message her?

I really don‚Äôt want to never message her and move on from her. She‚Äôs really special to me. I love her a lot. She was the best friend I ever had besides all the bad stuff we did. I know we are both grown up now and we wouldn‚Äôt do any more stupid reckless shit if we were friends again. 

Help. I‚Äôm a wreck.",bpd_disorder
"Without going into detail, this diagnosis explains so much. The sudden break ups, severe mood swings, destructive and controlling behaviour - all makes a lot more sense now.

We have been on and off for the past 7 months since we broke up, but recently we‚Äôve been on and it‚Äôs genuinely felt like we‚Äôre rebuilding a meaningful connection again.

She came to me straight away after her psychology appointment to talk to me about it, and what it could mean for us in the future. She shared her insecurities and concerns about it, but also what she knows she can build on within her self moving forward. She told me with confidence that she is willing to give our relationship a good shot again, and I am too.

Being aware of her diagnosis, we can work together and with help of her psychologist it looks like she‚Äôs getting back on track again - and I‚Äôm willing to support her through all of this.

She‚Äôs asked me not to tell anyone about this at least until she‚Äôs ready, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve come here to update this subreddit.

Anyone willing to share any experiences or give any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",bpd_disorder
"(Reposting here on the larger sub on recommendation of people from the smaller sub)

I am not sure how common my story is, but I think it's more common than I would think.

I was a problem child for a lot of my childhood in school, but began to improve in middle school. I was very bad with people all my life and everyone who meets me ends up disliking me (this is not an exaggeration, this is unfortunately quite literally the case). This caused me to be a very homebound child and I grew very, very attached to my family. I was academically rather successful in HS, but socially the same. College was an unmitigated disaster for me and at the urging of someone I ""saw someone"". The last time I was evaluated was for autism and ADHD in elementary school and was given a clean bill of health, so to speak.

After two days of talking to someone, the psychiatrist said she believed I had BPD. I heard of the condition before, but I was taken aback and after several sessions asked if she stood by her assessment and she said yes (she claimed to have a bit of experience working with people with personality disorders). After our sessions ended (I saw her in secret), that was kind of it.

I began reading about BPD more and more and the more I read, the less I saw myself in the condition. Yes, I have huge issues with impulse control and have pretty dire self inflicted issues with my health. I am very clingy to people because of the fact everyone I have ever known has run away from me. I have a limited sense of self, to a certain extent, and have huge problems being alone without anyone with me. 

But otherwise, it just doesnt click all that much. I am not suicidal, I am not driven to make rash sudden decisions that screw up my life, I am not the kind of person who would quit a job just because I want to curse out my boss (I am pretty good at holding my tongue when there is something in it for me). I wouldn't say I have emotional dysregulation. I know mood swings are the calling card of the condition, and I cant say I have mood swings. 

I know you have to meet 5 of 9 criteria. I would say I meet 3 of them like a glove, 4 if we are being generous, and 5 if we are playing fast and loose. And that is just to meet the lowest threshold of the condition. 

This happened a few years ago, and I havent followed up on it, but the problems in my life havent gone away. 

I figure that I have to wrestle with whether or not I was misdiagnosed to make progress on that front. Is it a thing to be misdiagnosed? Is this a condition like ADHD, where it's over applied? I am a guy, if it makes any difference.

Thanks a lot, everyone",bpd_disorder
"I grew up mostly dating men but realized when I was a teenager that I also like women. I know for sure that I am attracted to women, but I go off and on with feeling or knowing if I like men. Do I dislike my male ex‚Äôs because they did me wrong or because I forced myself to date men through compulsory heterosexuality?


A few years ago I did believe that I was a lesbian, then went back to bisexual a year later. Now I feel like I am a lesbian again but honestly I really am not sure.


I label myself as queer now because I don‚Äôt know if I truly fit into the bisexual category or lesbian category. I wish I didn‚Äôt have so many identity issues so that I wasn‚Äôt so worried about this/may be able to understand myself easier and not struggle so much with my identity.",bpd_disorder
"I posted on this sub earlier today about having trouble believing my boyfriend even loves me. We are literally moving into a house together and he always reassures me so I know he does‚Ä¶you can look at my post history to see it. 

Anyway, I spiraled and got drunk out of anxiety. I went into his facebook page and went YEARS deep and found pics and posts and comments with an ex from literally so long ago. We are both 22, and he was like 16 in these posts. But I saw his family interacting with her and saying how much they love her like they do to me now, and I have broken down. I am sobbing and hysterical and so upset. I know it‚Äôs irrational but I am a mess right now. 

I feel like I have been flying off the BPD handle lately. I am never NOT freaking out about something. I guess my question is, should I mention this? I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs my issue, and not his. He also didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, this is from YEARS ago. I just now can‚Äôt get it out of my head that his whole family is just tolerating me at best, and I am just meaningless. I hate that he has had exes because ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know why. I do, too.

"So within the past couple months ive came to the realization that I have to deal with my borderline and bipolar. 

Been out of the dating scene for two years after a string of awful relationships. Me and this girl have talked as friends everyday for 6 months  been dating for 3, and it‚Äôs great overall I love her very much. 

With the new relationship ive found myself creeping into old thought patterns and codependency. I‚Äôve never been to a psychiatrist or anything, just been obsessed with personal development since I was 14. It‚Äôs hard to deal with because logically she has done nothing to trigger these emotions.

I thought I had these aspects of myself dealt with and released but there‚Äôs still more. I find myself worrying about every little change in energy or if she will just get bored and leave me.

"Two days ago I posted something so cute about hitting 76 days clean and now I‚Äôm all fucked up. Idk what happened but my bf (LDR) said that he wanted to shorten my trip length from a week to just a weekend. This changed comes after about a week of him acting really weird, he says he‚Äôs got a concussion but he worked and drank too much making it worse. I was ok with that but I wish he told me before when he was acting weird so I knew. 

He wasn‚Äôt talking to me or texting me as much as he used to saying he needs to minimize phone time or he just doesn‚Äôt use his phone when he‚Äôs out or with fam or friends but he‚Äôs with them 24/7!! The phone is literally how we communicate and how this relationship works!! I felt abandoned like he just didn‚Äôt care bc he refused to compromise, we went from talking ~1-2 hr on the phone each day and like 500???? texts to like ~30 min on the phone and 100 texts a day. 

I really hurt. I felt alone. He has so much time with his friends and family in person and I don‚Äôt ever get to see him, and he still wants to shorten our trip that is literally still a week and a half away bc of his concussion when he literally does the same stuff we‚Äôd be doing maybe even more when I came up. He says he needs to feel independent but I‚Äôm literally 1000 miles away and am just ducking asking for 8% of ur time every day.

You know what my mind jumps to‚Ä¶ I believe him when he says he had a concussion but I really just feel like he changed into a different person. He went from being the perfect person everyone loved him promising me everything caring and understanding and now he acts like I‚Äôm fucking disgusting and he hates me. 

Tonight he promised me that I would have a chance to call and talk to him for a while, but then he called late and said he was tired and needed to go to sleep to rest up instead but then I texted him a little later and he texted back and he had just been chilling with his brother who he sees CONSTANTLY. And then called his friend instead of talking to me after promising me!! He always sees and talks to these people he lives so close to them!

"Is it overcompensating because you feel unworthy, so you need to give others an added value, because you aren't one ?
Is it you picking narcissistic people so that they feed of you, since it's familiar?
Is it out of kindness and empathy?
Is it out of guilt?
Were you trying to save yourself through them?
Why the self sacrifice?
Why doing so and not being at all happy about it, even angry at yourself?
Why those people disappear once you stuck on their side when they were in distress? Or was it you pushing them away, because you feel that now that you aren't needed you will be discarded? Or them changing their attitude? Are you the jerk at the end ? Or is it them ?
And why does it feel good, so good when you weren't the one that messed it up, after asking most of the people you know, if you did? And why can't you get over it, ever,  when you did?

I still feel them-- especially as I was taught from early ages to equate self worth with sexuality etc, but I work hard daily to be better. 

I confessed everything to my husband a year and a half ago, and my marriage has really changed for the better. Before where we had no connection, we have finally been best friends now the last while.

"not trying to play the complete victim here but i feel as though my childhood trauma and pain molded me into what and who i am today. my mother is a narcissist but unaware that she is because she‚Äôs old school. my father is deadbeat. i have both mommy and daddy issues. because of this i never really knew how to keep relationships. growing up i‚Äôd stay in toxic unhealthy relationships to the point where now i have ptsd and bad anxiety attacks. as time went on my ptsd grew more and the anxiety attacks also. being cheated on, ghosted, humiliated played a big part. BUT... now one thing i‚Äôve realized about myself is that i‚Äôm starting to pick up this behavior where i am getting into relationships &amp; whenever someone cheats on me or hurts me, i play victim whole time i cheated first or and cheating just like them except i play the victim and act like as if i‚Äôm not doing anything wrong. when the person ends up leaving and coming back to apologize, i hold the grudge over their head hoping it‚Äôll hurt them into thinking their karma is coming for them for how they treated me. when whole time i‚Äôm mirroring what they are doing to me without them knowing. 

i stay in this victim mentality and don‚Äôt break out of character. i‚Äôll cry and cry and cry, but deep down i know im not the victim but they‚Äôll never know that. you know, a lot of people have thought their karma was because of me. maybe it was, or maybe it wasn‚Äôt. is it so wrong to play victim though? i need answers.",bpd_disorder
"Hi all. I‚Äôm a 24 F with diagnosed BPD. Right now I‚Äôm on Zoloft and going through DBT.

"Hi there, I would very much like to talk to anyone who has done or is doing Transference focused practice for BPD or other issues. I have tried it but haven't found a therapist who is a good fit yet and would also very much appreciate any names of therapists (any area) since it's so difficult to find TFP specialists.

I know TFP is supposed to be a challenging and non-supportive therapy, but so far I've found it very difficult, at times I honestly have felt like I'm going crazy (perhaps from the inherent message you get that you don't know reality as well as the therapist) but I really don't want to self-sabotage and quit.

In case it's interesting to hear my experience, I've briefly seen a female therapist in Mexico who disappeared when she didn't have availability and a man currently in the U.S. who has made me uncomfortable by repeatedly asking me about my sex life (mostly at the beginning but it's hard now because I don't feel I can discuss similar topics since I've been pressured) and who at times comes off as sarcastic, he has no Google reviews but was the only person I could find and is in my neighborhood but all my TFP sessions have been online so I'm happy to talk to anyone in the world.

I'd also love to have an actual phone (or at least text) conversation with someone doing TFP so we could support each other going through it.",bpd_disorder

"I didn‚Äôt have a breakup, but I had an ending of a situationship which honestly wasn‚Äôt that serious but really took an emotion toll on me.

I continuously remind myself of how they don‚Äôt remember me probably and dont care for me at all anymore. Yet I wish they wouldn‚Äôt reach out ever and I know I‚Äôm done with them, but it‚Äôs so easy to trigger myself and get right back to where I was initially after them leaving.

My long time friend came over to visit for two weeks and we got into a big argument because I tell myself that he doesn't care about me and that I might as well fuck everything up now since I know I'm going to fuck it all up later. He left to his uncles house, which is understandable, but at the same time I wanted him back because I don't actually want to be alone and I couldn't stop crying. I got really upset and sent his girlfriend a sex video of us and told her he likes to have her on the phone while having sex with other people, which is true, and I know it's out of line for me to do that but in my head at the moment I just thought I'm not seeing him again anyway so I'm going to extra fuck everything up. Now I can't stop crying because I know I really fucked up now but at the same time I wasn't going to see him again anyway. I don't know what to do.

He's hurt me a lot in the past too but I don't want to make excuses. I didn't want to feel abandoned again and I knew it would happen so I self sabotaged and now I'm like why the fuck did I DO THAT??

I know this post is all over the place but I really can't think straight right now. Let me know if I need to clarify something or something like that.

The last time we hung out, I subtly described to him that he's my favorite person. I didn't use any bpd terms, but I just sort of told him how much I appreciate and admire him, and how I find myself relying on him and being dependent on him often.
He didn't seem weirded out, he even reciprocated a bit. He told me stuff like ""I love hanging out with you too."" ""I love being friends too.""
He told me that... so why? Why is he ignoring me?
CW: self harm ideation

 It hurts so badly, it hurts so badly I've been wanting to cut to just make the pain physical.
I don't understand why he would say such sweet and nice things to me and immediately ignore me for 2 weeks.

I've been telling myself over and over how much I hate him and how much I want to cut him out completely.
But it's not true...I really don't want to cut him out. I want to stay friends and I want to be someone he can rely on too.
I'm IN LOVE with him. I love him so much it hurts me every day because I can never have him and I'm wasting my time.

I'm kept up at night thinking about what I might have done wrong.
I might have scared him away? Maybe he didn't mean all those nice things he said, he must have only said them to quell me.

I honestly would rather he tell me he thinks I'm a freak and that he never wants to speak to me again...instead of doing whatever this is.

i don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôm doing here and i‚Äôve never posted before, but i guess maybe i just needed to brain dump. i‚Äôll prob delete this.  

but anyway, i‚Äôm 28 and was diagnosed with bpd about 6 months ago. honestly i was relieved. i felt like finally there was an explanation for why i feel and act the way i do. my fianc√© (been together for 10 yrs) was super supportive and we were gonna tackle this thing together. ever since i got my diagnosis i do feel worse though. like things that i‚Äôm working through are closer to the surface and more easily triggered in a sense. i don‚Äôt feel like myself anymore. 

my fianc√© is great. i love him more than anything. but we‚Äôre getting married at the end of the year and he‚Äôs terrified. he‚Äôs staring down the barrel of the rest of his life with someone who‚Äôs not quite the person he fell in love with. just a shell of her. and because of this, his fuse is short and his patience is thin. we‚Äôre fighting nonstop and i feel like reality is slipping away from me. as if i ever really had a grasp on reality lol. but we‚Äôll fight and i won‚Äôt remember what i said, or how something went down, or i‚Äôll make something up and FULLY believe that is the way the events unfolded, when it actually is not. and no, he‚Äôs not gaslighting me. 

honestly that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg for how disjointed i feel. i‚Äôm trying so hard and it really is not good enough. like i‚Äôm not getting encouraging results. and i‚Äôm scared it will never be good enough to give him the stable partner he deserves. because even though i folded clothes today, which is a win for me, our relationship is still in shambles and he is hurting deeply. so fuck the laundry. but i still need to celebrate my little wins you know?

"Hey. So life is pretty rough and has been getting progressively worse for the last 8 years. Lately I've been getting literally spirals from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep. Every single day. It's causing so many issues for me to even function. I try coping mechanisms, deep breathing doesn't help. It's stopping me from doing anything creative... The finished project just ends up a disaster because I can't get into any kind of flow which only makes me belittle myself more. 

Sadly I don't really have any support I can go to. I'm in therapy but sadly I can only have a session every few weeks. I don't have any friends or a family i can speak to. Meditation I try to get in when I can (I'm in a chaotic house with no privacy) it sometimes helps but usually the spiral over runs it and often the house is too loud. 

I'm also unemployed with no money so getting out to get a coffee or something isn't an option. Walks in nature help but often the spirals come back the moment I get home. I would happily do them for longer but I'm worried it'll get to the expense of my daily life. 

I'm spamming this group lately because I'm getting into these spirals and I don't know what else to do with that cursed mindset... It makes it worse anyway, but by the time I'm ready want to go to sleep my brain is going the ""just end it"" route really intensely every single day.

"I hate everything, I met this girl five months ago and we got attached to each other, we chatted every single day for hours and it meant so much to me to have her, because no one else was there for me like her. But of course with time, she started being very distant and I felt she was abandoning me and I told her and I tried everything for her not to leave me. 

I think she started hating me because I was so emotionally attached. And I don't know if I was imagining it all, but I messed everything up back then and it hurt so much. I just hated myself, because of all the harm I may have brought to her when I felt I hated her, all the jealousy and horrible feeling I had, that caused fights.

We took some time apart from each other, which hurt because I only felt happy the days we talked. I tried to distance my thoughts from her and talk to other people. A month ago I thought I was completely okay and she wasn't my favourite person anymore.

 We started to talk again and we were pretty good friends for a while until I felt I had feelings for her. I had fallen in love, and she was my everything. It felt so good and I thought I was finally okay. Yesterday she hadn't answered a text of mine for hours, and I wasn't mad. But I realized she may have been active talking to other people without answering me and I started hating her. I blocked her and I just wanted to cry.

I just don't understand. It hurts so much to feel uncertain about what I feel, I didn't feel love, she is still my FP and I was idealising her. I don't know what's wrong with me. I hate myself, why did I react like this? Why does it affect me so much? I wish I had never met her, it hurts so much. I don't want her to be my FP. I don't want any. I wish I felt things normally.

"Hi all! I've been on this sub before, but I left a while back because of the whole, y'know, denial thing that anything is actually wrong and putting blinders on. You know how it is.

I've been a total piece of crap to my husband, who has been my biggest champion for YEARS. I've allowed myself to be a total slave to my illness and basically refused to do anything to better myself. I didn't feel that I needed it, but holy shit I do. On top of that, I've discovered that while not diagnosed, I do actually fit the NPD criteria. Not fun in. The. SLIGHTEST. But it really explains a LOT and knowing about narcissistic rage answers a lot of questions, which helps.

I've lost all of my friends and family and while my husband still loves me and cares for me, he is so hurt by everything I've put him through. I am at a crossroads in my life: I either keep putting fingers in my ears and insisting that I don't need to change, and thus getting divorced and being completely alone, *or*, I can make the damn changes, make amends, and have the family, friends, and husband I love, want, and need.

It's time to make my indecisive ass choose something for once.

For those of you who have successes and have been able to make amends in damaged relationships, and have made changes in yourself; what are some ways I can be better about my illness and more aware of the effect I have without hiding from it? How can I be a better person for the people who love me dearly, but are very tired and hurt?

I‚Äôm having a really really hard time coping. She dumped me in December and I was doing alright, but saw her this week and helped her out with a few things. Now I just don‚Äôt trust people and want nothing to do with anyone. I still desperately love her even if I‚Äôve realized it was always me trying and giving it my all and she kind of didn‚Äôt, at least towards the last four months. I can‚Äôt stop crying all day, I‚Äôm up all night crying. My life sucks and is hard rn for other reasons as well. I just want to move on and don‚Äôt know how. I know I‚Äôm in an unhealthy bad spot rn but I don‚Äôt know how to change. I don‚Äôt want to date anyone anymore, which is fine by me. I just am so depressed and miss her a lot and can‚Äôt get over her leaving me like that. Please help",bpd_disorder
"I feel like I can't see clearly and I don't know if I'm in the wrong or not anymore.

Yesterday my husband and I got in an argument. I feel like I don't get any time for myself (we have an 8 month old and a dog that just had major surgery. My husband is off work with an injury for the last 4 months)
I was up with our son at 6am. Got him ready for the day, let out the chickens, come back in and made pancakes for everyone. When breakfast was ready he said didn't  feel good (injury I assume) and took his breakfast out on the deck and smoked a joint (its around 8am by now). This was a bit upsetting to me as I thought we would have breakfast together...and why is he smoking weed so early? I don't know, I was a bit sulky. He stayed out there for about an hour then came in to start his physio. For whatever reason, this took until 2pm or later. I was gradually getting more upset and feeling more and more  like my time doesn't matter and I'm just expected to be the one that takes care of the baby, makes the meals, cleans the house etc.
These have been ongoing feelings for me since our son was born. 
I am the one getting up throughout the night and in the mornings.  I put him to bed and feed him his meals and give him baths and get him dressed. I feel like I'm not asking a lot to have a couple of hours to myself once in a while. 
Around 4 kiddo had a nap so I went to get some gardening done. Finally. 
This argument isn't over though, we don't talk for the rest of the night. He watches the baby for an hour when he wakes from nap. 6:30 rolls around and I come in to get our son, feed  him dinner  and get him in bed for 8:30. I go straight to bed as well. 

This morning I woke up at 6. Husband is already up. Try to go into kitchen to get coffee going going breakfast for our kid. He shoves me and tells me to fuck off. Told him I have to get breakfast for our son and he picks up a box of baby food pouches and throws them at me..  after this I take our son and go into the bedroom and lock the door. I was in an extremely abusive relationship in my early 20s and this behaviour scares me. He starts blasting really aggressive music and said if I turn it off he will end me...
All of this seems like a completely irrational and aggressive reaction to a pretty normal argument for new parents to have.
He then told me he pulled wires under the hood of the car so I can't leave. I wasn't trying to, but this is also scary for me. We only have one vehicle currently and live rurally. 
The music is still blasting, I'm hiding in the bedroom trying to keep it together.
Music is blasting for about 2hrs while he does his physio. Then, before he leaves he bangs on the door until I open it since he would just come in through the door that goes onto the deck if I didn't. He says some incredibly hurtful things, like, that I deserved to be abused by my ex (he fractured my skull and almost killed me) and that I am exactly like my mother (who I have been estranged from since I was 12)
Then he said he 'definitely didn't piss on my toothbrush'...? Needless to say I have thrown it out...

Then he takes the car and leaves. 

I want to tell you, I have definitely caused my fair share of problems in the history of our relationship. I have CPTSD, depression, and of course, BPD. I am on medication and have gone to therapy and have come a long way in the last 6 years.
My question is... did I cause this? 
Did I bring this upon our marriage and upon my beautiful son with things I have done in the past?
Am I not understanding that I hurt him somehow the day before by being upset? 

Will I be cursed to not trusting my own feelings forever...?",bpd_disorder
"My fp has been really insensitive towards me these past days. Doing things that trigger me on purpose, ignoring me for hours, saying hurtful and mean things to me for no apparent reason. He does not not have bpd and from my understanding isnt dealing with anything stressful.

He has been texting me WAYYY too little past week whivh has fucked my mentality up a lot. I am currently trying to hheal from trauma from being forced to leave my own home from very late november to late february by the government. I have 5 different government workers harassing me everyday, i cannot catch a break, i dont wanna tell him because i feel embarrassed. Ive asked him multiple times to talk to me more because its harming my state a lot, which he has responded to with ''ill try'' ''alright'' but never doing it. 

yesterday was really bad and i relapsed and he didnt even bother reading abt it(online only fp). he does not pay attention to stuff i say and is fucking insensitive. Hes mean to me for no reason, this has never happened. he used to be the opposite of what hes doing rn. he keeps leaving me on seen and giving half assed neeutral responses. earlier i in a sarcastic way said hes mean to me becaue he left me on seen once again, when i asked a question. he said he doesnt care when i mentioned once again that i hate when he does that bc i start unhealthily overthinking ( he has never done this before). his response broke me, he genuinely word to word said ''if you are gonna get worked up from stuff like this i cant tolerate that'

i dont have friends to talk to, my only friend of 13 years left me and i didnt get a reason. its gonna be his bday in 2 days, i feel like hes gonna ignore me all day. today i had to take a day off and just whined all day abt it. he said he doesnt like talking to me anymore, ''all i do is whine'. i fucking whine becayuse u treat me like trash. i got so worked up i started sobbing out loud again but i gave up. i tried to make a normal convo, since ive been really fucking lonely i asked to do smth with him, he agreed, hes not gonna fucking do it i swear. 

i just want to feel loved once again. i dont understand why he is being so fucking rude to me for no fucking reason, i feel like im going insane. i cant take this anymore, i dont wanna leave him because i still care abt him (in a romantic relationship), (he knows abt my bpd.)",bpd_disorder
"I keep seeing post about people with mentally ill significant others being tired of caring for them and supporting them and it‚Äôs fucking with my mind. On one hand I know he loves me back and has never said anything that suggests he would leave, but on the other I‚Äôm so fucking paranoid and don‚Äôt know how to cope. I was clean from self harming until a few weeks ago when I relapse after having a breakdown in the parking lot of his apartment complex when i was 100% sure he was gonna leave (because he suggested I go home when he saw i was really unwell mentally that day. He was trying to be supportive but I was very closed up and anxious ) 

It‚Äôs like the rational part of my brain tells me I‚Äôm overreacting and i know it‚Äôs true but the irrational part of me keeps telling me that he‚Äôs fed up with me and plans on leaving ASAP. 

On one hand I want him to leave for his own good but if he ever did, I‚Äôd fucking hate myself and resent him (even though I would push him to do it)

I am in therapy and it‚Äôs helped but I‚Äôm just so scared.

How is one supposed to not be an incel when every rejection makes him more insecure, which then makes every woman more disgusted by him?

Am I just supposed to be alone trying my best till one woman is finally desperate enough to look past my insecurity?  I can only do my best, and it has not been good enough for every SINGLE WOMAN THAT HAS EVER SEEN MY FACE.

"Hi Everyone!

My name is Hannah Kitcey. I am currently getting my doctorate in psychology and doing my dissertation on BPD. I think that lack of adequate research and people who are actually diagnosed with BPD being left out of research (not getting the space to tell their stories) is what leads to a lot of misunderstandings and stereotypes. I want this research to be useful as a whole but also to each individual who chooses to participate.  Below is a little about my project.

**Who**: Individuals ages 18+, currently have or have had a BPD diagnosis

**What you will be doing**: 1 interview aimed at understanding your unique perspectives and experiences; 1 debrief meeting involving artistic elements 

**Time**: Meeting times will be determined by the comfort and schedule of the participant, not to exceed 1-2 hours  

**Location**: online available for safety and participant comfort (Zoom platform)

**Why**: To use personal narratives and artistic exploration to create open dialogue

If you are interested in being a participant in my study or have any questions, please reach out to me on here or via my email [hgkitce@pointpark.edu](mailto:hgkitce@pointpark.edu)",bpd_disorder
"I‚Äôve been very insecure about my abilities and intelligence these days but I‚Äôve always considered myself more intelligent and talented than others especially since a lot of people told me that. The insecurities that I‚Äôm in reality dumber than those expectations led me to become somewhat of a perfectionist, where I literally spend hours correcting a few paragraphs and realize that it makes so little difference and I just wasted two hours for nothing. Does anyone else feel this way?",bpd_disorder
"I have an extremely unstable sense of self. I find ""stereotypes"" and while I feel like I belong in that role while I'm playing it, I ultimately believe after I'm sick of/finished playing that role that it isn't ""me."" These roleplaying ""phases"" (for lack of a better word) can last anywhere from hours to months, and at this point my life is revolving around playing these certain roles and creating these narratives. 

Even though my traits can be static, they also change around these roles. My speaking, mannerisms, and even coping skills change with each persona I put on. I also dress up my body and change it to fit the narrative I'm creating. I even tailor things as small as my phone homescreen and my music ""taste"". I don't know how to know who I actually am or what my role is in the world. I know I'm a teenager and that's apparently a teenager thing to do but I don't notice anyone else struggling so outwardly with it, and their personality traits stay relatively the same. 

Am I ever going to know what my actual personality is or if I even have one?

if i ask people if they‚Äòre upset with me and they say no i assume they‚Äòre lying, so they can‚Äòt really do anything to make it ‚Äûright‚Äú for me.

All that's happened is that I've come to accept my life is how it is. I'm always going to feel like this. I'll never make any more friends and the close friends I used to have will probably never speak to me again, even though I'd love to keep in touch with them more than anything.

Instead of being MIA for 6 months straight with the occasional ""how are you? Good. Good"". My next goal is to text my sister at least once a week.

"I am very grateful to be on disability because I know that so many people struggle for years to be approved, but it is a very little amount of money, and I am stressed to the hilt trying to provide for myself + my daughter. Every purchase I make is stressful - counting out every dollar for each month all the way down to how many slices of bread I have to make sandwiches. I want to work at least casually because I think I could handle it if I was in a low stress sort of environment where I could sign up for hours when I'm okay and then just not take shifts when I'm not, but my shrink + doctor keep getting frustrated with me when I mention wanting to at least volunteer to test out my ability to handle some form of work. They keep reminding me of how quickly I can get overwhelmed + how easy it is to be kicked off of disability and that working shouldn't be my priority right now since I've only recently stabilized. I wish I could make them live on what I'm living on right now just for a week. Maybe then they'd realize why this is a priority for me and offer more support and encouragement. It's either be stressed about money or be stressed about work. There's no low stress option. I don't have family to rely on. There's nobody buying us gifts or dropping off groceries. It's just me + this tiny amount of cash each month that needs to cover what my daughter and I need. The amount of time I spend googling free bread donations, clothing drives, etc... has to be the same amount of time I would be spending on working a shift or two each month. Honestly.

It's so bad that I don't even try to date anymore because either I tell myself I like that person and then unknowingly treat them like dogshit because I don't actually like them, or I like someone so much that I would literally kill myself for them even if they don't like me back. How can i date/love someone without making them my FP? i feel like it's impossible, i feel like the only way i can truly prove to myself that i love them is if i go insane over it and obsess and make them my world. I also expect the same from them, which is unrealistic, but I end up spiraling out of control and attacking them when they don't reciprocate my feelings. I despise it so much.

Abortion is not an option for me. I don‚Äôt think I could go through with adoption. I desperately want to be a mom someday, but this was so unexpected. I really don‚Äôt know what to do or think.

The constant switching of my emotions and constantly asking him to leave and then saying I'll take my life if he does is so confusing.

I also take 3 medications - all of which have huge warnings against taking during pregnancy. So I just went off them cold turkey.

My stomach is so nauseous

Heightened anxiety

Can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôm a bad person

What if I really don‚Äôt care about people

And all I care about is how they make me feel or what they can do for me

That thought is traumatizing

I don‚Äôt want to be a manipulator

I don‚Äôt want to hurt people or use them for my benefit

What if I can‚Äôt ever love and feel real empathy

What if I‚Äôll always be a sad selfish person concerned with my own despair

I don‚Äôt even want to tell people how I feel anymore

I‚Äôm so sick of saying the same thing and hearing the same shit

A broken record on repeat

I know im annoying, and I don‚Äôt want to be a burden

I want to be the reason people smile, to be someones safe haven

But all I ever do is use people

Im haunted by past memories, throwing away friends for male attention

Whoever was a gateway for guys, my drug

Treating people like pawns Just to get my fix

Desperately desiring attention Because it made me feel like whole

I wasn‚Äôt a person without someone else

Reminding me of who I was

And sometimes I still feel this way
Like an addict in relapse

Remind myself I don‚Äôt need anyone else

But the emptiness makes me an emotional mess

As long as I have someone to love, to please
To care for

Or as long as someone else is showering me with the attention and validation I need

Then I‚Äôm complete

But without, its like a drought

No idea who I am

Im so sorry, please forgive me

"Abilify (Aripiprazole) has shown some clinical effectiveness in treating borderline personality disorder.

And let me just say, these magic little tic tacs have made a world of difference for me, when combined with therapy and my antidepressant. A year ago, my romantic relationship was particularly triggering, and I was prone to episodes of rage and self harm. I felt horribly inadequate, alien and at a constant risk of being abandoned.

Nowadays, my moods are steadier, without any sense of being ""zombified."" It feels like I have a chance to practice some self-soothing exercises when I'm feeling triggered, as opposed to suddenly flying into blinding, red-hot fury or a suicidal spiral of desperate sadness. My self perception is also a lot more rational- I still see my faults, but they don't seem world-ending, anymore. The people around me seem more accepting, trustworthy and empathetic. 

Even if they're not prescribed Abilify, I highly recommend that anyone who is feeling ""stuck"" in their current treatment speaks to their psychiatrist about treatment options. I had to specifically ask about them, months after my diagnosis, to start the conversation. 

It's worth it, and so are you.",bpd_disorder
"There is one guy in the group who takes up a lot of space. They talk loudly and they talk over other people but they are also put in heaps of time and energy and have great ideas.

I responded to the other person and then he got angry at me. I got angry back and pointed out that he does this all the time. Two other ppl backed me up. Another male in the group said I was out of line and that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to respond anymore and now it was his turn. I tried to point out he was being unfair. I was angry. He told me to shut up. I walked away.

Feeling super alone. I stand by everything I said but it was really not an effective way to communicate. It would be really great if this guy (who has the ideas) could give more space to others because then we could actually work together instead of him feeling like he does all the work.

"I was diagnosed with BPD last year and it has put a lot of things in my life into context. Since then, I have noticed that I swing from either a highly empathetic person, ie. crying with someone I know when they're experiencing grief, or feeling randomly angry at someone I deeply love getting upset. 

I find it ESPECIALLY difficult to empathize after I split on someone or have impulsive behaviours in my relationship. After the event has happened, I try to put myself in their shoes to try and resolve things. Yet I see myself in such a bad light anyway that feeling the pain I've caused them is enough to make me suicidal. So, it's like my brain just can't go there, like a mental block.

"i I have BPD and I've been a relationship with my boyfriend for 6 months and we've known each other for a year. We dated for 3 months before but he lied to me about relatively small stuff so we broke up for a couple of months and then I took him back. I've been having serious doubts about the relationship for about a month but I'm worried that it's my bpd that's acting up and making me push him away.

My main problem is that we constantly bicker and have been doing so for months. We seem to annoy each other all the time. I'm not sure we have that much in common and I'm not physically attracted to him. But I've previously had two separate relationships that both lasted for 2 years and he treats much better than both my exes. I know that he feels strongly for me. We also work together so it's easier to continue the relationship for that reason. I also really like his family and would miss them a lot if we broke up. My family also loves him. I've also grown attached to his cat.

Even with all the bickering this is still the healthiest relationship I've been in and I want to make sure that my bpd isn't making me ruin it.",bpd_disorder

"TW: Contains brief mentions of abuse, including sexual. No examples or details though. 

Disclaimer: I'm aware men are also diagnosed with BPD, albeit rarely. I'm also aware not all PTSD is caused by the actions of men. This is simply my experience and interpretation informed by the misogynistic roots of BPD. 


I don't have a ""fear of abandonment"" but if I did, the actions of my dad would've been the cause of that. He remained married to my mum for 20 years, 19 of which I grew up within, whilst maintaining a second secret family with two children that he prioritised more than us. My own dad lied to my face most days throughout my childhood and teenage years, gaslighted me, made me feel embarrassed and uncomfortable for asking questions as simple as ""where exactly do you live when you work away, dad?"" or ""what do you do at your job?"". When he finally divorced my mum, he did so only after being confronted by me putting the pieces of his lies together. He continued to deflect, deny and lie so naturally I blamed myself for the end of the marriage. Even though I was right all along. 


My entire upbringing was built on manipulation and emotional abuse. Meanwhile, my mum had untreated mental health issues and took out her anger on me verbally, sometimes physically, and neglected me. I never felt heard or understood. I felt like I couldn't trust anything I was seeing or hearing. Is it any wonder I started to experience dissociation, derealisation, depersonalisation, and imbalanced emotions? 


Looking back, my ""symptoms"" flared up: after the revelation of my dad's secrets, when I was bullied at school, whenever I was sexually or emotionally abused by a man, whenever someone blatantly tried to deceive me despite the evidence being glaring, whenever someone twisted my words or actions to fit their narrative. Whenever my optimistic worldview is shattered, or my perception of reality is denied, that's when I can't cope with this world we live in. That's when I feel like I wasn't meant for this world. 


I don't feel shame over my diagnosis anymore. I took responsibility for my future; I didn't blame anyone else for the mess my life has devolved into. I did DBT and many other forms of therapy, I sobered up, I threw myself into regular exercise and began building a solid routine. I removed people from my life who were causing me distress; I removed myself from any disagreements that were spiking my adrenaline. 


I barely cry anymore and, when I do, it isn't hysterical or in an inappropriate moment. I don't shout, scream, slam doors, or spam people with texts or calls. I've realised that if someone wants to exit my life, that's for a valid reason and will result in a better life for both of us. I'm content on my own. I don't mind that I don't have many friends or a really small family. I enjoy spending time with myself and my cats. I do have a boyfriend but I don't at all worry about him cheating or leaving. I don't feel insecure or jealous. I've been this way for over two years now. 


Funny how my personality isn't ""disordered"" at all. My personality is kind, lovely, bubbly, excitable, optimistic. My personality values the importance of true connection to animals, humans, nature - and to myself and my values. My personality is independent, self-reliant, motivated, introverted. My personality isn't ""emotionally unstable"". 


All I had to do was stop seeking validation, understanding, and empathy from those incapable of providing it. To radically accept that everything happens for a reason. Most importantly, to stop tolerating abuse from men. To stop re-traumatising and hurting myself. To understand that I was never the problem. No child is to blame for the method of coping they select in response to ongoing abuse. 


Disclaimer #2: I'm not at all suggesting we don't have responsibility for our behaviour as an adult, or that we don't have to work to change so that we can be happier. We, of course, must do both. For ourselves. But that doesn't mean we are to blame for the patterns that began to form before we were old enough to practice self-actualisation. We are also not to blame for these patterns continuing into adulthood whilst we're still confused, distressed, frightened, and traumatised. It's straight-up victim-blaming to blame our inherent personalities for our responses to trauma. The blame for this ""disorder"" lies solely with the perpetrators of abuse. Men are treated for their PTSD without being blamed for placing themselves in a situation that exposed them to war, abuse, etc. Women are accused of being emotionally unstable and hysterical, and called ""bad people"", ""unwilling to change"", and ""manipulative"" for struggling with the effects of traumatic situations that were in no way their own fault. It's horrifying, misogynistic, and disgusting. 


Maybe psychiatry should be addressing the impact of men's (and women's, but in my case mostly men's) abusive actions on women and children, and how this leads to detrimental rewiring of the developing or vulnerable brain.

Anyway one of the comments basically said how BPD people were doomed to hurt, couldnt get better and people and to avoid them. I replied saying this was all false basically. And that their views were quite bias and stigmatizing. 

Now being downvoted. And I just feel deflated. I know it's just strangers on the internet. It's not that that is upsetting. It's that these stigmatizing views are genuinely what the majority of people think.

Couldn‚Äôt find anything on the topic but I was wondering if anyone else has felt disconnected from their ethnic background? I know things like wanting to change your name or looks often occur with identity disturbance but I always struggled with feeling like I was born into the wrong country. Especially when I was a kid/teenager I would spend time with kids of different backgrounds and I would feel like I didn‚Äôt fit in cause I was of different ethnicity to them so I would make up things about my background to ‚Äúbe cooler‚Äù. Some countries I‚Äôve been more infatuated with than others and if I had friends from that country I would try to prove to them that I knew heaps about their traditions and could say things in their language and would feel inferior cause I couldn‚Äôt really be one of them‚Ä¶ which is so dumb cause obviously I can‚Äôt just change my ethnicity.

So yeah. Is this normal? I read ab BPD and I have like every sign and like all the traumas that cause it too. But also I‚Äôm j anxious and depressed and adhd and ptsd and then also mild paranoia and dissociation so idkkk. But when I read these posts they resonate w me like more than anything else. I went to therapy just cus people told me to and it was awful. Later learned my therapist was a duck but he pretty much told me that me being positive was me being fake and then I spiraled down into like binge eating bc I couldn‚Äôt dissociate anymore after therapy. ‚Äò‚ÄòTwas bad. He sort of was saying that me having a positive and bubbly personality was all a show tho.

"DISCUSSIONS OF SEX, SELF HARM AND SUICIDAL IDEATION S

Saturday night, I went out. Already feeling pretty down. Met a woman at the bar. We went back to her friend's house. Then to mine. Had sexual interactions. I couldn't maintain an erection. So, I was left feeling off. She gave me her instagram details and I sent her a follow request.

She left early the next morning. Then last night. I got super drunk. Gambled and lost a bunch. I tried reaching out to a bunch of people. Then, I turned up at her friend's house. Scared her friend, then I left. I had an implement to harm myself on me. I was going to, with the intention of finality, when I saw a message from a friend I'd called earlier. I called him. He talked me down and I went home. 

This morning. The girl who stayed over told me she'd had fun, but what I did was unacceptable. She wanted no further contact and was considering filing a police report. 

I completely agree. I apologised and told her I understood. Then asked if she could contact the police. I unsent that message and she has since blocked me.

TLDR at bottom with quotes from article.

‚Äî-

I can‚Äôt sleep, so I‚Äôve been laying in bed contemplating my mental health and doing cell phone research. Anyway, came across this article that was REALLY interesting to me.

I‚Äôve never been tested for autism, but I‚Äôve suspected most my life, never tested because parents didn‚Äôt see it and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, then several years later the diagnosis was corrected to bpd, and I just put it off as okay bpd has similar things that‚Äôs all it is.

However, my wife and I both have bpd and we‚Äôve been comparing thought processes and talking about mental health a lot lately. And while we‚Äôre similar, we differ in a lot of ways. There‚Äôs a huge part of my behavior she still can‚Äôt understand when it comes to understanding what‚Äôs appropriate in certain interactions or in the often completely different ways I interpret situations.  It brought me back to thinking maybe it is something more than JUST bpd, so yeah‚Ä¶  the googling.

I put the article at the top and I‚Äôll put it [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5590952/#!po=1.02041) as well.


Basically I‚Äôm not crazy‚Ä¶ 

TLDR: I‚Äôll sum it up with some quotes from the study:

‚Äú‚Ä¶some females with BPD have undiagnosed ASC, due to ASC not being easily detected in females.‚Äù

‚ÄúRecent research is focusing on the possible under-diagnosis or mis-diagnosis of ASC in females [40,41], on the assumption that females may experience greater societal pressure to conform and be part of a peer group and so are more motivated to learn how to hide their autism (so-called ‚Äúcamouflaging‚Äù) and thereby go ‚Äúunder the radar‚Äù of clinicians or school psychologists, by ‚Äúpretending to be normal‚Äù [42]. This may lead to them either receiving their ASC diagnosis far later than males, and/or being diagnosed with other conditions (anorexia, depression, anxiety, or BPD) because clinicians are not looking for how ASC may present itself differently in females.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶found that 6 out of 41 BPD patients fulfilled criteria for ASC.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur findings highlight the need for careful examination for autistic traits in patients referred for an assessment for BPD, especially in those without a history of significant childhood abuse or neglect. Some of these patients may have been misdiagnosed (their ASC was overlooked), and a proportion of them may have both conditions.‚Äù


To put it short‚Ä¶.

Def going to talk to my psych MD about if I can be tested for autism now. Holy crap this article made every thing about me make so much more sense! Now I‚Äôm wide awake too! I mean, last thing I need is ANOTHER diagnosis to add to the pile, but if it helps it helps! So much for research articles putting people to sleep.",bpd_disorder

"Hello, 

I just learned that I have BPD. I always knew something was wrong with me. I‚Äôve failed at everything. Relationships, careers, the military ‚Ä¶. I thought my discharge would be a new healthy start‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve been dating my ‚Äúgf‚Äù on and off for over a year now. At the beginning we fought because I always felt like she was hiding something &amp; it would turn into huge fights where she would be upset because I don‚Äôt trust her.

Well long story short, I ended up finding out that she didn‚Äôt disclose a STD about 6 months ago by finding a medication bottle in her apartment and I ended up ghosting her for 3 months because the feelings of betrayal were so strong‚Ä¶. If she would‚Äôve just told me I would‚Äôve  accepted her‚Ä¶ but she made me feel crazy‚Ä¶. She lied to my face &amp; she was still trying to force me to stay in the relationship. I had to go‚Ä¶

I ended up wanting to reconcile things after I took time apart but ever since she‚Äôs been holding me leaving over my head &amp; I know ghosting is wrong but I felt like she wasn‚Äôt respecting my space and pain.

For the past 4 months she‚Äôs been holding me at arms length because she‚Äôs still hurt about how i left her &amp; the ensuing rages i go into don‚Äôt help. I throw things and get verbally abusive . It‚Äôs terrible and i hate myself every time i do it. When I get angry I just want her to admit how messed up it was to gaslight me whenever i used to tell her i had trust issues and i felt like she was hiding something. That really hurt me to the core .

She did eventually  apologize and i said i  forgave her and i thought i did but it is proving so difficult. I‚Äôm so hurt still but i love her beyond her flaws . And it doesn‚Äôt help that i feel like she doesn‚Äôt treat me like she did before. I may be selfish for this but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that she gets to treat me like I‚Äôm the reason the whole relationship tanked and even though we are actively working on trying to fix things, her distance makes me feel so insecure and I‚Äôm not someone worth committing 100% to.

I had been having episodes almost daily trying to get through to her &amp; tell her how i think it‚Äôs unfair how quickly i let her back in but she can‚Äôt do the same for me. It makes me feel like crap.  I stopped drinking because the rages kept becoming worse and she said i was making the relationship toxic. 

Problem is, I‚Äôm still having episodes because I still feel angry for what she did &amp; she blames me for leaving saying i abandoned her but I still came back and am trying to love her despite everything. When i talk about my feelings, it quickly becomes an argument because she says we can‚Äôt move forward because of all the resentment i harbor. The moment she begins to raise her voice i fly into a rage and this last time i think i crossed the line and said some really terrible things i wish i could take back‚Ä¶ She say I‚Äôve been abusive since i met her and I‚Äôm finding it hard to live with that. Yeah she has done her dirt but i think i took it too far last night‚Ä¶I feel as evil as my mother 

We are going on a trip tomorrow that we had originally planned to take to bring us back together but after last night i think I‚Äôm going to tell her goodbye &amp; do things on my own while we are abroad . I feel bad for making her feel like crap and always bringing up the past but I‚Äôm so angry. She knew my past but that doesn‚Äôt excuse the way i have been treating her and now i feel like a monster who can never forgive and will hurt everyone i come across. I get so verbally abusive and reading back on the messages i feel like a very dangerous person &amp; I feel like i don‚Äôt deserve a relationship because they all end so turbeulent.  But she was the first one i actually felt like i fell deeply in love with and vice versa. My trust isn‚Äôt completely ruined after this but piece of me feel like i deserve it from a lot of shit that happened in my past

Idk what I‚Äôm asking here but I‚Äôm packing and trying to prevent myself from spiraling out of control. I guess i needed to vent? I don‚Äôt really talk to my family and don‚Äôt have many ‚Äúclose‚Äù friends who would understand and i don‚Äôt want to disclose information about her health status to them. She was my best friend but I can hear it in her voice that she‚Äôs over me. I think this was the last straw. She said if i actually love her i would be patient with her healing process but i feel like I‚Äôve never gotten that from her myself so i lash out.

I guess I‚Äôm seeking help in with coping with the fact that i think I‚Äôm meant to be alone &amp; finally letting her go. I said terrible things &amp; i can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm that type of person. ‚Ä¶

"47 y/o male. Divorced. In stable relationship now - finally.  

While visiting my parents this weekend, I opened a box which contained painful memories. One was so many letters and cute things from my courtship with my ex-wife and mother of my child. I‚Äôve been able to come to a place where I don‚Äôt fully blame myself for the end of my marriage. I get that it was both of us, only I did the acting out. Of course.

What is more painful tonight is that my mom kept every letter my college ex girlfriend wrote me. Reading back, it‚Äôs so easy to see the pure love she had that was so hard to see then. She was also the one who took the most emotional abuse, when I was at worst and had absolutely zero self-awareness. All these letters and pics showed a genuinely good person who did not deserve any of what I subjected her to, and that is difficult.

It‚Äôs been over 20 years. I since had a 14 year marriage which ended, have a ten year-old son, fell hard, and have gotten up. I have my pain, but I now manage myself better than ever.

"Recently diagnosed with BPD after a very short, very traumatic involuntary stay on a psych ward.

I tried explaining to the doctor all of my symptoms to a limited degree of success, I find it difficult to put into words how I‚Äôm feeling/ what I‚Äôm experiencing and he didn‚Äôt seem to have a lot of patience for me which made it more difficult.

I tried to tell him about what I believe were episodes of psychosis, however, he said something or other about how because I‚Äôm ‚Äòaware‚Äô of these episodes, then they can be explained away as my ‚Äòinner dialogue‚Äô. 

He seemed happy with his diagnosis of BPD, and I do tend to agree as most the listed symptoms line up with the symptoms I have been experiencing for years now. 

However, his disregard for my other experiences has left me feeling a bit isolated.

During one episode, a family member told me later that I was ‚Äòincoherent‚Äô and ‚Äòinconsolable‚Äô, having not slept for two days I was ‚Äòwide awake‚Äô and practically bouncing off the walls. I believed that my family were trying to kill me and frame it as a suicide, and I was (apparently) talking to a friend (who wasn‚Äôt there) about ‚Äòthe plan‚Äô. (???).

Recently I‚Äôve been hearing more disturbing things, like jumbled, distorted voices that feel aggressive. This is kind of distressing, but not as distressing as the hostile kicking on the windows and doors. (Which I know isn‚Äôt real, otherwise the dogs would be losing their shit).

I love her a lot but I just find it endlessly difficult to get along with her as she is very intense. We argue a lot, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, but I do hate that one silly argument can result in a week long silent treatment/ resentment in my mother. This period kills me as I love to sort things out soon (no later than a day), say our apologies and move on. After every argument she‚Äôll say something along the lines of ‚Äúit‚Äôs not like we have a good relationship‚Äù ‚ÄúI will get back to you to set up new boundaries for our new relationship..‚Äù or she‚Äôll threaten to never talk to me again and accuses me of causing her lots of pain. This is why I moved out.

Ive notices that she copies a lot of the things I do and that she is finding herself at the same time I am. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that but it makes me feel icky. She copies the shoes I wear, wants to travel when I do, wants to suddenly move to another area when I‚Äôm moving out of home (when she‚Äôs never had any of those thoughts growing up). It feels like she sees what I‚Äôm doing and compares it to herself. If I wear new pants she says ‚Äúwhere are they from? How much? Why don‚Äôt I buy myself things like you do?‚Äù. I got annoyed the other day when she wanted me to get her the same shoes I wear so I said ‚Äúmum you have your own identity I‚Äôm sure there are lots of other shoes you‚Äôd like‚Äù and it offended her. She tried to clear this with me on Easter, I apologised and she stopped talking to me and it was awkward as hell. Shes used the line ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to establish new boundaries for our relationship [implying less connection etc‚Äù. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have questioned her identity but I wish I had a mum who had her own taste and timeline. She‚Äôs 53. I hate that she holds resentment for so long. It‚Äôs awfully tiring and I can‚Äôt sleep. Me and my bf can sort issues out more efficiently and it‚Äôs so much healthy.

"So‚Ä¶ I mean I‚Äôm really only broken up over one of the instances, but the second mimicked the first and it kinda sucks.

To make a very long story short, I dated this girl for a few months in 2019. She has BPD, too. It felt like a feedback loop. Something would happen, she‚Äôd get upset and accuse me, I‚Äôd get offended and get snippy, she‚Äôd yell at me, I‚Äôd yell at her. She hit me once, was emotionally abusive, pressured me into sex multiple times, crossed my boundaries, threaten to break up with me or to kill herself, SH and make me help her clean it up. I would ignore her when she upset me to piss her off, I would SH and tell her about it, basically it was just really fucked up on all fronts.

It got to a point where she was completely dependent on me to get her through episodes, but she was never there for me when I needed help. I ended up breaking up with her, because I couldn‚Äôt even handle my own mental health, so it was making it worse to try to handle both of ours at the same time.

I felt like I was dying. I‚Äôve tried to hard to rationalize; that I left because it was unhealthy and it was only getting worse as time went on. But I was so sick of myself, I hated myself for leaving her, and it felt like I was literally dying. Like I would never be happy again.

New scenario, much less serious, just a friend, but I‚Äôve decided to walk away because it‚Äôs very one-sided and it feels like she‚Äôs using me for the things i buy her. I‚Äôm less torn up about walking away from this relationship, but it‚Äôs reminding me if my ex and is reopening that wound.

I also feel ashamed that I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs and I get mad at my sister for not getting back to me in a timely manner. This has been going on for YEARS though.

"My (24f) girlfriend and I (27m) recently having been doing some research and talking about how she shows a number of signs of BPD. Thanks to Dr Keith Gaynor's brilliant lecture on BPD we're pretty sure it was her car accident a few years ago that was the traumatic stress trigger that caused her BPD to spiral and it's been very up and down ever since. As you all probably know having this condition, the lows and highs can occur from hour to hour and day to day, and she's in a pretty good spot today and hoping it lasts through the week. 

What makes this most difficult for me is that I don't really know when she's flipped the switch to crisis mode. I can't live my life constantly on the look out for it right now, and any time i'm not fully prepared myself to deal with it, it spirals into a fight between us and that fight almost ruins a whole day for us. Stress about her current job situation means this could be a tumultuous week, and she's also in classes at night. 

We've agreed that the only true solution is finding the right clinician and getting the help she needs, DBT seems promising! But at the end of the day, we're still really new learning about this condition, community, lifestyle whatever you want to call it. As someone who suffers with severe ADHD, from my own experience I felt like it actually got worse when I started learning about it more, it's like your brain can't help but exhibit the symptom you just learned your condition has a tendency to cause. Thankfully I'm in a place where I can support her with her work or class projects if she needs me to when she can't cope, and she's been returning the favor and helping me with my own scatter brain and forgetfulness. We're an amazing couple 80% of the time, and a hot mess 20%.

She won't be able to get professional help at least for another month or so. And I'm truly worried about her and I want to do everything I can to help her navigate her life until then. This weekend was really really rough but tonight she seems to be getting to a better place, so please any tips or things to watch out for to help her not feel in the middle of a crisis every day!

"I was talking to my bf about (funnily enough) BPD traits that I‚Äôd learned the explanations of on Tiktok. I was giving an example of one (about tying yourself too much to your actions, so that when someone asks you to do something, like, ‚ÄúDo you mind putting your cup somewhere else next time?,‚Äù you get oddly angry and defensive because it feels like they attacked you personally), and I gave an example of my own. I guess it was too pointed with the tone I used, because my bf accused me of having a specific time in mind that involved him, and became on edge and told me I was getting triggered and needed to take medicine. No matter how many times I told him that I didn‚Äôt have a specific instance in mind and that I didn‚Äôt mean to sound so pointed, I don‚Äôt think he believed me. He just wanted me to hurry up and go have some space so I wouldn‚Äôt freak out. 

And it‚Äôs like WHY does it have to be that I‚Äôm attacking him when I am not?? I‚Äôve had a lot of trouble with it before, and can still struggle now, but I‚Äôm trying to be BETTER. Even when I notice I‚Äôm getting triggered, I‚Äôll sometimes try to diffuse my emotions/distract myself by showing my bf a funny video I found on tiktok. And does it matter? Of course not! All that matters was that I got triggered in the first place, and that‚Äôs a point against me. 

Why does it feel like people WANT me to be the fucking problem sometimes? I swear, I‚Äôm trying to get better, but it doesn‚Äôt matter to anyone! They‚Äôre used to me having a problematic role, and that‚Äôs just where I‚Äôm supposed to stay. 

If I get triggered, I‚Äôm a toxic lunatic. If I tell people that I was able to cope better and not freak out this time, it‚Äôs a little ‚Äúgood job,‚Äù and then forgetting it ever happened. And that happens with EVERYTHING, not just my BPD. 

I‚Äôm largely seen as lazy and irresponsible, and it‚Äôs TRUE. I‚Äôm a waste of space! But, when I finally accomplish a tiny step forward, it‚Äôs fine, but not a big deal, because I should‚Äôve been doing that already.

Why do ANYTHING, then?? Myself and the people around me have gotten too used to how awful I am. We‚Äôre all too comfortable. But, I really wanna feel/do better and FEEL SEEN.",bpd_disorder

I'm doing well; I am taking meds as prescribed; I don't drink or do drugs (not a judgement if you do); I started taking long walks recently, I have a full-time job with benefits and a decent apartment. i am going to ask my psychiatrist for a referral to see a Psy D that specializes in DBT, or Schema based therapy.

I am not yet diagnosed with borderline but I‚Äôm almost 100% I have it. And it‚Äôs killing me. It has been killing me all my life. It has affected my friends, my loved ones and myself. But you probably already know that

What‚Äôs concerning me right now, is whether or not I can feel love. Right now, my girlfriend and I are on a one week break from one another.

And before that, ever little thing I didn‚Äôt like that she did, set me off. When it shouldn‚Äôt have, and I know it shouldn‚Äôt have. But it did anyways.

so i went on a date last night and it went so great. he‚Äôs super sweet and we got a long really really well. he texted me asking to see me again today and i said okay. i just get so attached sometimes and it‚Äôs so unhealthy. im really scared that it‚Äôll happen again. i already gave him the whole mental illness talk because i like guys to kinda be prepared and let them have the chance to leave before things get further. he had no problem at all with it (: i also talked to him about not wanting like a hookup or to have sex anytime soon because i just got raped twice this past month and he was super understanding and had no problem with it. i can feel myself getting overly excited about it and i don‚Äôt want to latch on and get all bpd attached. are there any tips y‚Äôall have to prevent it? i don‚Äôt want to ruin things.,bpd_disorder
"I have BPD and I've been a relationship with my boyfriend for 6 months and we've known each other for a year. We dated for 3 months before but he lied to me about relatively small stuff so we broke up for a couple of months and then I took him back. I've been having serious doubts about the relationship for about a month but I'm worried that it's my bpd that's acting up and making me push him away.

My main problem is that we constantly bicker and have been doing so for months. We seem to annoy each other all the time. I'm not sure we have that much in common and I'm not physically attracted to him. But I've previously had two separate relationships that both lasted for 2 years and he treats much better than both my exes. I know that he feels strongly for me. We also work together so it's easier to continue the relationship for that reason. I also really like his family and would miss them a lot if we broke up. My family also loves him. I've also grown attached to his cat. 

Even with all the bickering this is still the healthiest relationship I've been in and I want to make sure that my bpd isn't making me ruin it.",bpd_disorder

"Every ‚Äúhobby‚Äù I have involves some kind of substance abuse or self destructive behavior. Anytime I engage in normal activities or hobbies, I‚Äôm so hypercritical of myself that it just leads me to give up and go with my unhealthy behaviors. Im desperate to fill this void inside of me with something healthy. Even stuff like exercise is difficult because I just hear this voice in my head bullying me the whole time. What are some things that you do when you feel like harming yourself or engaging in an unhealthy coping skill? Any hobbies that are good for perfectionists that beat themselves up over the slightest mistake? I keep telling myself ‚Äútoday is my last day engaging in this behavior‚Äù and then I crack under the slightest bit of stress and that‚Äôs all it takes. It seems impossible to stop myself from being self destructive. I want to dedicate time to practicing my DBT skills to hopefully minimize the behavior, but my BPD won‚Äôt cooperate and tells me that I deserve to suffer.

"Cross-post from /r/ADHD because a lot of these things have been associated with BPD and my bf has also suspected he has BPD. I still don't know whether this is the right place to post but looking for support/advice from those who know a bit more.

Me \[22M\] and my boyfriend \[21M\] have been together for over a year now and moved in together for a few months now.

I work a full time job and he‚Äôs a uni student studying a subject he's very interested in. This year was meant to be his first year but he kept skipping classes and so he decided he‚Äôd redo the year. The reasons he‚Äôs skipped classes were because he has insomnia and he sleeps very late, then when he gets up he‚Äôs too tired to go in to class. He also often has days where his stomach is unwell or he has a headache and says he‚Äôs not feeling well enough to go in. Which is strange because he feels well enough to sit on his phone or play video games. He‚Äôs also planned a week-long holiday in the second week of term with his dad (who he never sees).

He has ADHD and depression. He‚Äôs on anti-depressants and has ADHD medication sometimes.

I really care for him but sometimes I look at him and see that he‚Äôs not going anywhere in his life. I have a job and career whereas he plays video games all day. He‚Äôs been saying how he wants to make new friends and that he‚Äôs found moving out for uni difficult because he‚Äôs not around his friends from his home town, so it might be that he feels lonely and isolated.

I‚Äôve been encouraging him to go to therapy. He had a trial session and says he likes the therapist and said he would start once his third student loan payment came through. Once the money came through, it turns out that with bills included, it wasn‚Äôt enough for therapy. There was very little spending money. He did however have enough for other things like weed, which shows his priorities (he has not accepted that argument). He has mentioned going onto disability allowance, which would cover it, but I just think he'll use that as spending money and justify that he's not getting enough loan money. It feels like I made a mistake by just saying it's ok for him not to start therapy when he said he would, but at the same time I find it really hard to keep him accountable because he can't even do that himself. Even silly things like ""I'll do the dishes later"" and him never doing it or pushing things days or weeks down the line. I know this isn't the same thing for everything though, because with planning vacations HE'S the one who has to chase me up about it.

The other day he had an emotional talk to me and said how he finds it unfair that we pay 50/50 to the rent and bills because it means he has less spending money. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about this because I feel like he‚Äôd then become dependent on me. He says it would make him feel more comfortable because he says he feels I‚Äôm better than him with a job and direction. I feel like if I did that, he'd become too reliant on me.

I‚Äôve also been encouraging him to get a part time job, to the point of feeling panicked. My argument is that if he has a part time job, it feels like we‚Äôre both ‚Äòworking‚Äô and it‚Äôs not just me bringing in money whilst he stays at home all day. His argument is that I can‚Äôt rush him, that he is applying and to stop hounding him about it. The thing is, (perhaps because of ADHD) he says he‚Äôll only work somewhere he really enjoys or somewhere that pays really well. I‚Äôve told him just to work ANYWHERE and then move to a job he enjoys, but he hasn‚Äôt listened.

He also says he has authority defiant disorder because of his childhood, which means if he gets told to do something, he‚Äôs less likely to do it and that he‚Äôd rather think it up himself. But this really doesn‚Äôt help when he has 0 motivation and just does nothing all day. He is not close to family because he was technically adopted and has very few friends he relies on or a support network to go to.

I don‚Äôt know what to do because I care about him a lot, but I feel frustrated in our relationship, especially because he says he feels unappreciated when I get back from work and think about how I can help him all the time. There are lots of positive things about our relationship: I‚Äôve become more comfortable with my sexuality, for example. Generally, I‚Äôve become more comfortable after having moved out. I‚Äôm guessing this is a very codependent relationship, but I really don‚Äôt know what to do going forward because I‚Äôve tried so many things. If I push back too much I feel like he might snap or get feelings of abandonment or suicidal thoughts. It feels entrapping but I also really want to help him get help.",bpd_disorder

"First, I‚Äôm sorry this is so long. So, a little background, I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm completely free of my BPD, but I have my behaviors under control for the most part and continue working on it daily. I‚Äôm currently getting my Masters in Social Work and interning as a counselor. I have a supervisor I meet with once a week to get direction on how to work with my clients. Recently I got a client who has some form of PD, though and I‚Äôve been struggling with her. I can‚Äôt put too much out there but the most recent issue is that she‚Äôs been known to have paranoia (like people stalking her) but she gave me a story from her past that makes reasonable sense that her paranoia could be true. So I told my supervisor that I can‚Äôt tell if she has a disorder or is in real danger, and my supervisor acted like it was obvious she‚Äôs just paranoid. Then I said idk I just feel crazy‚Ä¶ then she told me it is a defining characteristic of bpd (for some reason she keeps saying bpd instead of personality disorder) that they make you feel crazy or like you just got done watching a horror movie. She doesn‚Äôt know I have it. Now I‚Äôm terrified I make people feel that way and don‚Äôt know how to check if I do. I‚Äôm also worried that maybe this isn‚Äôt the right field for me.

"For the past nearly 2 years my baby's father has been my FP. Its been excruciating because he left us in the beginning of my pregnancy. I tried so hard to focus away from him and even find a new FP but didn't work.

I just started seeing someone a month ago (my third new date since my ex). The first time we had sex I felt so fulfilled that I wanted to keep seeing him. His personality was also great. I wasn't the best towards him in the beginning and pushed him away but he never left &amp; still liked me the same. I became attached to him because of him sticking with me through my push &amp; pull behavior (I'm doing much better). And how fulfilled the sex made me feel and how much fun I have with him.

Anyway I'm trying to keep things healthy with this new guy and not rush things like I usually do. But I became super attached without being able to stop it and my emotions are connected to how things are with the new guy which I hate. I'm definitely not telling him how much I like him or scaring him off, I'm going to let him decide when to become official and advance the relationship in other ways.

Anyone here able to keep it going good with an FP? I hate this feeling of being attached without being able to control it but also its nice to have a new FP finally. I just don't want it to ruin anything.",bpd_disorder

"Hello, I have a question for anyone who relates or has knowledge of this: 

Does anyone else hear voices? 

They‚Äôre usually quiet for me when I feel okay/‚Äúhappy‚Äù, but literally anything from a tone change to absolutely nothing will trigger these damn voices to shame and berate me until I‚Äôm internally beaten to a pulp. They range from my past abusers‚Äô voices (using phrases they‚Äôve actually said to hurt me) and a small child and then a bunch of unknown ones. Sometimes it‚Äôs like an echo chamber of mental abuse that gets hard to ignore. I‚Äôve had them since I was a teen (height of my childhood abuse) but they haven‚Äôt ever been this intense and often. 

Everyday something triggers it. My first healthy relationship might be suffering because my sanity is teetering from these voices. They‚Äôve convinced me that my husband is falling out of love with me, *I‚Äôm* emotionally abusing him, and that *I‚Äôm* a narcissist tearing him down. I don‚Äôt want to lose my best friend to unintentional self sabotage, but I can‚Äôt afford therapy and I have no friends. It‚Äôs not fair to trauma dump on my neurotypical husband.

"Obviously finding a healthy relationship for most people is difficult, but having BPD or any mental health issues does add a new dynamic to creating relationships and making sure those close to you can validate and empathize with the internal struggles those with mental health deal with. I also generally describe myself as gay and pretty genderqueer/genderfluid and have had to work through a lot of trauma that is associated with my sexual orientation and gender identity, due to circumstances out of my control.

I was in a Dialectical Behavioral Therapy group for a year and have been doing 1-on-1 therapy for several years, particularly during high school, college and right after I dropped out. I feel that my understanding of my diagnosis with the skills DBT provided has really helped me stand on my own two feet again, I‚Äôd like to try and open myself up to the idea of dating, but I feel my mental health, sexual orientation and gender identity all play a part in finding someone that is ‚Äúright‚Äù for me. 

I‚Äôd like some advice on what other LGBTQIA+ people (and of course Allies!) with BPD do to make themselves more open to dating and setting themselves up for success when you struggle with mental health issues. Queer people already have a smaller pool of individuals to choose from, plus with the added emotional disregulation disorder, I feel quite limited in my options. 

I know someone will come into my life one day and accept me for who I am, but I want to have the tools necessary to make my next relationship not codependent and be open about my emotional state with my significant other. Do you possibly use a safe words involving your emotional state to let your partner know if you‚Äôre starting down the rabbit hole?

"CW: alcohol, sex, self harm 

I‚Äôve been binge drinking since I was 15. That‚Äôs just what you do here as a young person. Right away I think I didn‚Äôt have a good relationship with it. Back in highschool I used to drink to numb the pain. But I started noticing patterns like I probably had sex 99% of the time I binged. 

I‚Äôve been through the whole shebang with drinking. Fighting with friends and family, running away from home, unprotected sex, online shopping and dropping cash without a second thought. Trying drugs without second thought. Missing events and work. Cutting when I‚Äôve been clean for months. I once shredded my legs to pieces at my own house party because someone hurt my feelings.

When I drink, all the darkest parts of me come out. My inhibition is insane. It‚Äôs like my BPD is just sitting there waiting tor me to drink. I never pass out, I want to keep going. I become a huge fucking people pleaser. I know an issue of mine is I want everyone to like me. I want everyone to think I‚Äôm cool and awesome and the best. When I drink I will do anything to seem ‚Äúchill‚Äù. Often this involves acting out of character. I will over share to death. I‚Äôll get flirty just to try to seem desirable.

"Hey BPD,

I just wanted to see if anyone else does this.

I was recently diagnosed and have been seeing life through a completely different lens (thanks to a mood stabilizer and generally having a diagnosis to help frame things). My family is basically two families smushed together. When I was a kid, I was best friends with a kid, whose mom in turn became my mom's best friend and we've all been one ""super-family"" ever since.

I've always been the black sheep of this ""super-family"" since the age of 20 or so. I'm 32 now. I keep putting ""super-family"" in quotation marks because they're only super in size, not behavior. They're quite riddled with problematic behavior. Both sides of it adhere STRICTLY to the unspoken family rules of ""Don't rock the family boat for any reason,"" and if you do, you're the weirdo/problem/bad guy. They're the typical ""We don't talk about unpleasant things"" kind of people.  

I honestly think it took me so long to get a diagnosis because of these multiple times a year gaslighting fests. ""Am I overreacting?"", ""If dad shoots the shit with someone and ropes you into the conversations, acting like you weren't just in a screaming match a week ago, am I supposed to pretend we're okay?"", ""If my uncle starts talking about his incredibly flawed political beliefs, am I supposed to just smile and not and not interject?"" Well, if I don't just shut up, guess who gets the hushed ""talking to""? Just guess. I'll give you two tries.

I chose not to do it this year because god damn, I do not want to play ""BPD or Gaslighting"". I am in no way shape or form interested in that. I'm wondering how many of us here have this issue, and if so, how much more complicated does it make coping with BPD?

I will add though.... I'm really lonely right now, but I know that loneliness would absolutely not be sated if I went to this thing today.",bpd_disorder
"I don't have anyone who would even understand this IRL, and I've been on a waiting list for therapy for months, so I'm really begging at this point. I've been on a major mental health ~journey~ for a while but I've reached a dead end. Basically, I've never really had friends, at least none that would attend a birthday party or anything. I was taken out of high school and socially isolated by my parents after and was in I want to say deep psychosis. So, I developed a lot of long standing delusions that since I've left that situation have been slowly disproven and kicked. But not all, and that's because they keep getting validated.

A major one is that this world is my Hell or social experiment. And I'm only able to share that because if true I have nothing left to lose, ok? Whatever the punishment is. I need SOMETHING to change. So, as a result everything that goes great for everyone else goes horribly wrong for me. Other people are interesting and funny and lovable but I'm not. But I'm really at the point where I don't think that's true. I think I am those things when I am not being beaten down mentally, but for some reason, that's not enough.

If I'm in a good mood, when everything's going great, out of nowhere everyone around me is upset about something, usually to the point of melting down on me. When I match that energy as a result, suddenly once again everything's wonderful and I'm bringing everyone down. I think I am simply not allowed to be happy and move further in recovery, when that's ALL I want. I don't want drama but I CANNOT keep just eating it when I watch everyone else get praise and recognition for hard work (digital art for example) but I do it the exact same way (not in an active imitation way, but I mean the typical motions) and I'm actively passed over every time. I try to make friends over discord etc, it fizzles out fast, or they just don't like me, or all of a sudden they have a problem with someone else there and apparently that means they have to ghost me.

It's been YEARS so something has to change. And if it's me, I need to know how to change. I've been begging the universe or spirits to give me a clear sign or at least one I can understand on what I need to do. Only things that could've possibly been answers is basic self care. I know I've fallen off that since I've been horribly sick this past week but I actively plan to pick it up again now that I'm feeling better. So what am I supposed to do? Treadmill my way into relationships?

I'm asking because it's so hard to motivate myself to do literally anything when I give up hope that I'll ever have a social life. I'm human, supposedly. I just want to be loved. Cause all the recovery I've managed so far is gonna nosedive fast without any visible path. SHOULD I just give up? If so, how can I motivate myself to be alive and not just some husk?",bpd_disorder

"I moved across the country to be with my daughters father in December. When I was at home he hardly texted me or talked to me at all. We did text everyday. But it wasn‚Äôt much conversation and usually spaced out between 3-6 hours. He was very distant. Moved here and now every time he gets a text he‚Äôs answering it immediately, or he‚Äôs sitting on his phone looking at TikTok‚Äôs or whatever. I just want to spend time together without phones. I‚Äôve expressed this to him, and he says he should be able to go on his phone and have conversations. But it‚Äôs everyday all day.. just always texting someone else. He‚Äôs actively on tinder, so I guess that doesn‚Äôt help either. We don‚Äôt exactly have a title. But we do all things that a couple would. 
An example;
Last night I brought it up that I thought it was rude, and he randomly decided to take a shower to go to a store 2 hours away to purchase something for us at 630 at night and the store closed at 7. And I was cooking us dinner. He got mad at me and said fine I won‚Äôt go then. 
Wouldn‚Äôt really talk to me much, but he said he wasn‚Äôt mad at me. So around 12 I decided to go to bed.. I went to the room, checked my phone and he came in and said ‚Äúwow you‚Äôre just going to lay in here on your phone instead of hanging out with me.‚Äù I was genuinely going to bed, and the only reason he said it was because he would come in the room just to sit on his phone. 
Every time I try to express my feelings to him, it always ends up with me to blame. Because of the way I reacted to something that upsets me. I‚Äôll admit I don‚Äôt always react the way I should. But I do always try to express my feelings to him the best I can. Once he‚Äôs mad at me because of that, he won‚Äôt look at me if I‚Äôm trying to talk to him, a lot of times he will end up sleeping on the couch. One time he even said as punishment. 

I truly try my hardest not to let that control my emotions.

"i get so deeply obsessed with guys so quickly, i met this boy around a week ago and im really obsessed, the first day we met it was at a group campfire and i immediately thought he was rlly cute, the second fire pit we sat together and he touched me and kissed my forehead (consensually), we got each others snap and started talking a little more and ft, the third time we hung out we kissed and that‚Äôs not too much of a big thing but it is for me, i hadn‚Äôt kissed a guy until him, at first when he leaned in i moved away because i was just scared and nervous and he said he was sorry and that everything‚Äôs okay and i don‚Äôt need to do anything i‚Äôm uncomfortable with, then i saw him again last night and he was so different, when i first got there he didn‚Äôt even say hi to me and he was acting so weird, his friends pulled me aside and told me
that he was just playing me and he didn‚Äôt care about me, i confronted him abt it and he said they were lying and nothing they said was true, the rest of the night he didn‚Äôt really speak to me and just kinda stared at me every once in awhile, when he left he hugged me bye and that was it, his friends again told me that he‚Äôs just playing with me, i txted him and he said he doesn‚Äôt know what he feels or wants, i want to believe that he‚Äôs a good person and that i‚Äôm not just another girl for him but i don‚Äôt know what to do, i am really just so obsessed with him, should i just feel it out and not give him alll of my attention? like talk to other guys/girls. also does anyone have any tips on how not to get too attached ?",bpd_disorder
"I (19F) just got diagnosed with bpd, which has come after awhile of muddling through depression, anxiety, social anxiety, adhd, etc etc diagnoses. I‚Äôve read a lot about the frequent comorbidity of adhd and bpd, but I haven‚Äôt found too much about comorbid bpd and social anxiety. I think the bpd flew under the radar since I‚Äôve been isolating myself so intensely since I was a kid that I don‚Äôt have a lot of relationships in my life. 

In the past year (since I got diagnosed with adhd), learning about rejection sensitivity has helped me feel a little less crazy, and hearing about people‚Äôs experiences with bpd has helped me a ton. For a long time, therapists tried to treat my social anxiety and the way they described me felt so wrong, even though I related heavily to the criteria. I figured I was just a dumbass who was too lazy and attention-seeking to really try to get better. 

Anyway long story short, I‚Äôve ended up choosing to completely isolate myself most of the time instead of potentially setting myself up in situations where people are able to leave me, since I assume they‚Äôre gonna always choose people over me. Unfortunately that means when I do get to socialize and it goes well, I feel absolutely amazing until I see whoever I was with someone else and completely spiral.

I‚Äôm curious what other people‚Äôs experiences are with self isolation and social anxiety. Portrayals of bpd I‚Äôve seen tend to make it out as loud and aggressive (which I know isn‚Äôt the case a lot of the time), and I feel like they tend to describe the severity of someone‚Äôs condition as a function of how much they impact other people. Sorry for the long post lol. 

TLDR how has comorbid social anxiety impacted your experience of bpd/does your bpd cause you to self-isolate? And does anyone have advice for working through tendencies to isolate if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôve dealt with? I‚Äôm really tired of my room lmao",bpd_disorder
"First of all I know this is extremely unrealistic and unhealthy. But I really really wish my favorite person had never seen any other pretty woman in his life. Online or irl. I wish I could wipe all of them from his memory. And sometimes I dig so deep that I find posts of women that he has liked even before he knew me-and then of course I compare myself to them a lot. It‚Äôs so dumb and so much wasted energy, but I can‚Äôt stop. I wanna be the best in every way, but seems like I‚Äôll never be the most mature one. The last thing I‚Äôd want is to scare him away.

Context: I take antidepressants and took two Seresta to calm down but I didn‚Äôt feel any effects. 

I just want to rage tbh. I know it‚Äôs bad but I‚Äôm so disappointed in people that are close to me and I feel that they don‚Äôt take me seriously unless I throw a temper tantrum which reminds them of my mental condition (their words, not mine, I wish it was different and I could just communicate when I don‚Äôt feel comfortable).

A random commenter decided to say she probably has bpd. IDK about you guys, but I haven't had an irl boyfriend and a online boyfriend at the same time nor have I heard about that being in the diagnostics for BPD. :') It's so randomly hurtful to come across these stupid and hurtful and really uninformed comments by people that probably were either dumped by a girl with diagnosed BPD or more commonly they were dumped by someone who was awful so they ASSUME they have bpd and now every girl that sucks probably has bpd, in their minds.",bpd_disorder

"So this is my first Reddit post. Whatever that means, I‚Äôm just lost and really seeking help. I don‚Äôt want to end up like another BPD story where the love of their life walks out. 

I lied to my partner Thursday, I believe I had a BPD episode and he doesn‚Äôt. Even if he doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs my fault, I‚Äôm no longer taking my meds or going to therapy. 

On Thursday I made up a lie. About my partner‚Äôs ex whom he keeps in contact with (but we both keep in contact with our exs- nbd) I said a lot of crazy shit‚Äî I received a ‚Äútext‚Äù message from someone who knows her and said they (his ex and him) would ultimately be together in the end, that he is using me, that he wants to be with her, and that he is deleting messages between them to because I have gone through his phone in the past, that I was crazy.

I don‚Äôt know why I lied to that extreme, I just know that it was fucked up which is why I‚Äôm seeking accountability. 

What does accountability look like for someone with BPD, I know I lied, I know I‚Äôm not on my meds I know I am not going to therapy. 

When he confronted me about the lie on Friday I realized I had spilt it was all black and white thinking in my head. He loved and missed his ex and hated and wanted nothing todo with me. As I‚Äôm writing this I realize it isn‚Äôt the reality of things but I still acted out. And I need to be held accountable for my actions. I don‚Äôt want to lose the love of my life. 

After he left the apartment to clear his head I began to cut because I needed to release all my emotions and built up anxiety. As I was looking at the blood fall I knew I had to seek help I didn‚Äôt want this to be the last feeling I felt.

"Do I tell them that I feel suicidal?

Or do I not tell them?

I don‚Äôt really understand what is considered threatening suicide. I feel genuinely suicidal over little things that people do, especially if they‚Äôre my FP. My intention is to tell them so they can understand how I feel and how badly I‚Äôm hurting, but based on past experiences they considered this threatening suicide and is therefore an act of manipulation. 

I‚Äôm so upset and confused over this. As someone with BPD I really do genuinely feel suicidal very very easily - and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm supposed to hide it from the person who caused me to feel this way, or to tell them how I feel. Like for example, if my FP wanted to break up and it led to me feeling suicidal, am I supposed to tell them? Or if it‚Äôs something really little like if they left me to go do something, which triggered my abandonment issues and made me feel really suicidal, do I tell them?

When I tell them I‚Äôm suicidal, I‚Äôm communicating my genuine feelings and I want them to understand how I feel - I‚Äôm not lying to them just to get attention. However, I also feel like I‚Äôm manipulating them into staying with me or helping me, and it also definitely comes across as manipulation to them.

I'm in one right now but it's the first time in 4 months that I've really felt my BPD. I've had lots of other shit going on but my BPD just hasn't been an active problem for me. I feel like the most clearly BPD symptoms for me are the social ones like splitting and stuff. Aside from those I struggle the most with dissociation and suicidality. None of these (aside from dissociation) has been a big issue for me lately. I've actually felt pretty positive about myself and how I'm doing mentally. Of course fast forward to today and we are going through it lol. Anyway I was just curious if there was anyone else on here in this section of their journey in healing.

I still feel strongly discouraged when my symptoms rear their head even though I know it's a sign of progress that it's getting farther and farther in between episodes.

"So very first, a few people I really care about know the person behind this Reddit account: This isn't about you, you haven't done anything wrong. This is about me. 

I've been wrestling with my personality for a long time. There were facets that frustrated me. Any wording I could use never seemed to fit. I find them to be an uncomfortable fit.

But the other day, after years, but only weeks with a delightful new therapist, I stumbled on it.

I feel like I always have to 100% on the best-friend game. I'm not saying I'm perfect, but I try to be perfect. I've seen, and have been working on how this quest makes me less of a friend in some ways. I was, for the longest time, terrified to tell people opinions that they might not like. I'm still afraid, but I'm getting better at it. 

If someone I care about needs something, I'll do it if I can. I'll give/offer things that I _think_ they need before they even ask.

I feel like I won't ever let myself rest at being the greatest friend I can be, that any failure to deliver makes me a failure as a friend. These are the people that save me from my mind, and I want to save them from everything, because I never want them to leave.",bpd_disorder
"I'm currently seeing a psychologist and I believe I might have mild BPD, I have some of the symptoms but not all although the cause of the disease fits very well within my childhood.


A question many people have about individuals with BPD is that if they have sympathy and that's something I question about myself a lot too.


I can feel empathy for my mother who's at risk of going blind soon, I worry for my sister and what actions she takes but at the same time I can hurt people, remove them from my life without a seconds thought.


I have a bf and the abandonment fear is strong with him, I'm always afraid of annoying him and losing him but I don't necessarily feel over flowing romantic love for him either, I think that's just because I don't really understand what love is due to my turbulent childhood.


My bf is very much against cheating and open relationships, he's very monogamous however a couple of nights ago I slept with someone that wasn't him and I don't really know why I did it, I guess I just wanted to and don't understand why I would put into risk this relationship that I have for over a year and a half for something that might last max a year and a half too.


The fact I don't regret it or feel any guilt is what I don't understand, is this something others with BPD also experience? I understand he'd be sad, I understand it would wreck him if he ever knew but at the same time I don't particularly care because what he doesn't know can't hurt him and I don't plan on letting him find out that easily, lying is also very natural for me I just choose to be honest to those I care about like my sister and parents.


I'm not saying I have BPD, I suspect I have it and I'm looking into it so that I understand myself better and understand why I do the things I do but can someone else tell me if it's common or understandable to do actions that would cause devastating consequences for yourself but still not regretting it or even feeling an ounce of guilt for those actions?",bpd_disorder

You know why the call the poor and mentally ill invisible people, it's because you're not supposed to see us digging in trash cans and restaurant dumpsters at 3:00 am for our dinner because we spent inside all day . Those who lack object permanence make up their own versions of what happens and what people believe or do. No one cared about my side of the story so I don't have one anymore, I'll save my last for you.  I do have a bit to say, I have had half a year to think and I have things to get off my chest. There‚Äôs no other way I can go about this in good conscience, I‚Äôve wanted to say a lot of things to you since our falling out last year, none of which were diplomatic to say the least. Expect a few paragraphs. It really comes down to letting my bruised ego take over when I found out I was going to be kicked out in July/August, becoming something that I wasn‚Äôt, and going full Joker mode when I started thinking about what it would be like to spend another year on the street. One thing I need to apologize for before the insults is not being my genuine self. 

I didn‚Äôt want to tell you I wasn‚Äôt comfortable sharing my twin size bed with you. I didn‚Äôt want to tell you I wasn‚Äôt attracted to you, and our sexual encounters were just that, for me it‚Äôs just cool to have sex with a bisexual person ever since I came out as bi. We really don‚Äôt have enough in common to be compatible, and I think you know that, we‚Äôre opposites in a lot of ways. I‚Äôm a metalhead, you listen to mostly pop from what I remember. I‚Äôm a light sleeper, you sleep heavily. I don‚Äôt like multiplayer games that much, and you‚Äôre too tall for us to have a proper physical intimacy. This isn‚Äôt about that however.

There are alot of things we both like, but there are just as many things we have to agree to disagree upon. I looked up to you for your cooking and intelligence, and tended to look down on you for the things you were interested in, but since you never asked follow-up questions about my interests, I unfortunately never felt compelled to follow up with you. Opposites do not attract, all relationships, especially friendships are built on a fair amount of common ground, and we didn't spend enough time acknowledging the things we both like. I have set aside my play through of Legend of Dragoon for that reason cause I know you wanna watch me play it, despite me really liking that game so far. A lack of communication is the one thing that does cause distance to grow between people, and I felt it was just as much on my end as it was yours. Most of your banter was just making fun of me and it wasn‚Äôt as playful as you thought it was. You need to work on listening as much as I do, if not more, and I‚Äôm not gonna let you gaslight me into thinking I haven‚Äôt changed for the better in the last couple years.

I don‚Äôt get away with blaming memory loss so you shouldn't either. Most of my frustration with you and Maddie boils down to being held to ridiculous double standards, something I‚Äôm more than familiar with. I‚Äôm not in denial about my issues, I‚Äôm not a hypocrite, I believe you two are in that respect. I can detect when I‚Äôm being judged as if both of you held superiority complexes. No one likes being looked down on in the social sense, even if you two can't help it in the literal sense. Yeah another tall remark for you. Unfortunately as time passed my insecurity is what stoked the flames of my porn addiction and why I treated you less than ideally. I did feel used when you stopped listening to me just as much as I used you, and you were smart enough to detect that. I apologize for being so selfish and ungrateful for everything you did for me last year, you could have just as easily refused my invitation to reunite. I owed a debt to Maddie for getting us back in touch which is why I didn‚Äôt feel irritated watching her frisky cats that nearly scratched up my PC screen multiple times. I'm also a cat fag so that might have something to do with it.

What I meant when I said I lost my identity is I forgot how to take care of myself, and part of that is embracing the autism, that passionate creative streak I always had that I thought I lost forever in back in early 2020 when the suitcase all of the fiction I had ever wrote as a teenager disappeared from the parking garage and you left the drag during the pandemic, so I ruined my mind by getting deep into drugs and awful sex with the 30 year old infant Cray Cray Cristine, until she got another war vet junkie to nearly gauge my eye out, only to curb stomp my face in instead and fracture my cheekbone. Look man, The reason I didn‚Äôt appreciate being called a hypocrite when I harshly criticized Maddie‚Äôs codependency is because I wasn‚Äôt seeking that kind of romantic validation in 2021. 

In the spring of 2021 the reason why I was able to even get on Maddie‚Äôs good side was because my mental health dramatically improved once I was watching Vtubers and not spending a single penny on them, and that‚Äôs what got me out of my depression and off the meth/crack/alcohol/cigarettes last year. As for media escapism I like the content I consume and porn is the only guilty pleasure I have. Wish I could finish the 100s of games I play and the comics I own a lot quicker, the horny is such a distraction. 

I won‚Äôt deny I was and am still lonely, sexually or otherwise. I know what my problems are and I‚Äôm self aware enough to recognize my flaws and other‚Äôs. That doesn‚Äôt give me the right to point the finger and obviously my reprimanding of Maddie was in no way constructive, and ended up being just as abusive as what she was already going through. Of course I had feelings for her, I think about everyone. Sure I‚Äôm always horny, since I was 12, and yeah my dick gets in the way of my friendships, but deep down I just didn‚Äôt want Maddie to get maimed by her ex, cause I do care deeply about people even if I have a weird way of showing it. 

I‚Äôm ready to move on when you are and thanks for being the best friend I‚Äôve ever had. I completely understand if Maddie doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me anymore, and that‚Äôs for the best. The two things I‚Äôm most insecure about how I look and my intelligence, and when Maddie misgendered me with an emphasized passive aggressive ‚ÄúSIR‚Äù when she knew I‚Äôm Non Binary and called me, ‚ÄúSO DUMB,‚Äù I was so hurt I had a very public tantrum. I guess that was the consequence of me unleashing my frustrations onto her. I rolled everything she and you said over in my head until I was miserable. It‚Äôs only very recently that I‚Äôve been working on projects that I have a different perspective.  It's clich√© to say but you haven't changed or moved on. You're the same asshole when I'm trying to work on myself. I wish you were not so close minded still. I liked you but you made too many assumptions and thought you knew everything, even going as far as incorrectly completing my sentences for me constantly.

Humbling myself has given me peace. The things I said to both you were completely unwarranted, especially with Maddie‚Äôs situation, it wasn't my place, I only know what She and Ellie have told me about her relationships. Maddie‚Äôs a good person, just stressed out. Most of us are. I just want to spend the rest of my life enjoying the time and friends I have. Life‚Äôs too short to sink into these patterns of behavior. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with BPD and I know the attachment/abuse cycle all too well and it's been programmed into me and has an affect on my interactions with everyone. I‚Äôm sick of it. Just don‚Äôt expect my cynicism or sarcasm to go away anytime soon, haha. That‚Äôs always been me, even as a child. Honestly maybe it‚Äôs best if we all moved on and made new friends, but it‚Äôs up to you. I really don‚Äôt have the patience for you not taking my expectations into consideration and I don‚Äôt like feeling like I‚Äôm a doormat for you to step on and I know you feel the same. If you value our friendship I‚Äôll do the same...but if you're going to be a bitch about everything you can go fuck yourself",bpd_disorder

"So a lot of other subs I've read and groups mainly targeted towards the spouses of those with bpd is actually quite disgusting. 
I have bpd diagnosed few months and was also with someone who had bpd (though he wasn't diagnosed I'm sure of it though he was way extreme) so he was very abusive and I did manage to leave but I never carried extreme hate for him afterwards because I'm a fucking human being who understands this person has been through extreme trauma, as have I. At least I'm working on it am I right? Also to forgive someone  and emphasise from their perspective as to why they've become this way (including me) has given me extreme sense of peace. 

So anyway I was disgusted at some partners who are actually more narcissistic and fake than we are!! Pretending to support their bpd partner in reality then speaking about them like monsters online like a bunch of snowflakes behind the screen.  Ugh makes me annoyed those are the ones who were lucky enough to grow up in healthy environments and not have to endure what we did! 

Anyway I'm not condoning abuse at all from this disorder I was just shocked to see NEWLY WED people moaning about their partners bpd history and oh no what have I done...and other disgusting things. Those are the real monsters in my eye. Please note I'm not talking about The ones who recognised they're in abusive  relationships and are trying to leave but rather the ones acting fake and then saying  truly sickening shit about their  partner online and their tough disorder online .

"I joined just in time to see that the subreddit is going on hiatus, but I'd still like to share my bit of positivity with you guys. My current FP is a friend I met online. I worried when I realized he was becoming my FP because I really didn't want to ruin things with him. I had known him for awhile, but we only started getting closer more recently. Early on when we started talking privately I had a couple conversations with him that should have made him run. Asking why he had done certain things or why his behavior changed. I decided to just go ahead and tell him I have BPD and what a FP is and how it affects me and our friendship. He's been very accepting and accommodating. He's been inviting me to play games (instead of me always being the one to ask) and makes an effort to respond and says goodnight. Things that he knows settles my anxiety about the relationship. I told him that one of the best things you can do for a person with BPD is just love them and show them that not everyone leaves. I actually asked him to be that person for me and he said he would. I was so touched. He's a lot busier than my previous two FPs, but I think that's helping me to not be so dependent on him 24/7. I'm working on controlling my emotions and trying not to be impulsive, but it's nice to know that he understands, so if I do something irrational things won't be over. I'm hoping that having this stable person in my life really helps and I hope anyone reading this that struggles with FPs can find someone that understands them too.",bpd_disorder

"I've been together with my gf for over 3 years now. Our relationship was partly long distance and  we are from different cultural backgrounds, so that's why it took me so long to find out. Recently I broke up with her, the break up was an ugly rage and in the aftermath she did all the self harm, manipulative behavior etc. She was furthermore under narcissistic influence at work what let to the breakup. 

She removed this person from her circle, or the other way and I let her back in. Firstly it was all good until I made a mistake recently, I fell asleep early (we are living seperated because of the scene my landlord won't let her back in) and I didn't answered her messages and calls. I woke up the next morning to see that she totally blew up my phone until 4 in the morning.  

I apologized, but now she is becoming nasty again and punishes me in all different ways for it. In about a month I will fly back to my country without her and I don't know what to do....should I just break up or sacrefice myself in the name of love?

"So I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, co-morbid with generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD, and insomnia. After reading the DXM criteria because of my psychology class, and reading some stories of people with BPD, I think there's a pretty good chance I actually have it. However, I'm not sure it's even worth getting diagnosed considering the bad reputation it gets for being difficult to treat by medical professionals and the ""manipulative"" aspect. Also, I've already been prescribed a lot of the medications they use for BPD for my MDD. I've tried at least 8 different antidepressants, probably half of those were SSRIs, and one was Bupropion so not an SSRI. I'm currently not on any antidepressants because none of them worked. In the past, I've tried multiple antidepressants of different classes at once (like Bupropion and Mirtazapine) at one point I was on Bupropion, Trazodone, and Aripiprazole all at once, didn't seem to really help a lot, but the Aripiprazole gave me akathisia. At a later point I was on Fluvoxamine and Seroquel at the same time, didn't help so I went off. Currently I'm taking Modafinil to help with depression and help give me energy during the day, Gabapentin for anxiety, Adderall for ADHD, and Temazepam for insomnia. I've also seen 2 different therapists for CBT and done Psychotherapy, none of it helped. I've heard friends talk about therapy helping them, so I don't bash on therapy, but I believe it's a waste of time and money for me. It has just never helped at all tbh. At this point would it even be worth talking to my psychiatrist about it? What's he gonna do, just give me another cocktail of meds like I've already tried? Also I'm about to undergo Ketamine treatment. I qualify with my current diagnosis, but if I were to be re-diagnosed with BPD, I believe I would no longer be eligible for treatment. However there are current clinical trials to see if Ketamine can help BPD, and looking at the research and what ketamine does, it sounds like it could be the best medicine for BPD. Do I just go on with the Ketamine treatment and hope it helps with whatever I have? Keep my lips closed about my suspicion of BPD so I can still get treatment rather than being diagnosed with BPD and continuing the agonizing process of trying a cocktail of meds for 3-4 months and then waiting until I get to the point of suicidal ideation, then saying making an appointment to say ""this isn't working I need different meds"" and continuing over and over? Trying new meds for years on end, hoping that in the sea of drugs there's one special combination that clicks with my brain chemistry to alleviate some of my symptoms? Because I've been trying different meds for 5 years now and I'm getting real fucking sick and tired of nothing helping.",bpd_disorder
"After looking into it it sounds like mood swings and crying is a part of it? Is that always a part of it? 

I grew up extremely sensitive. And I have these feelings of dread and what I can only characterize as an over reaction to what most might get over more quickly to seeing people struggling with a disability or disease for example. 

I'm not as bad as my brother in this regard, but for example, he once let his neighbor who got kicked out stay at his house for free, then live in his bedroom while he stayed on the couch because hte guy had a bad back. It took 3 months until he finally got him to leave and the guy was rude to him over it. Overly empathetic to the point of disregarding his own well-being. 

I was excluded and bullied from the 3rd grade I think because of whatever social issue I have of sensitivity. I changed schools because of it.

"My partner has a few patterns that really confuse me‚Ä¶I‚Äôm curious if this resonates with anyone and how to handle them correctly.

1. Connecting two unrelated events from different time periods. (Something they saw on my phone in passing a month ago, and statement I made a month later), and connecting them together into a narrative that is logical on the surface but easily full of holes‚Ä¶cue long discussions that go no where 

2. Mind reading my intent, accusing of me certain intentions, and why I do things, then insisting on them even when I point out I don‚Äôt feel this way‚Ä¶and if I point out that‚Äôs not how I feel they say I‚Äôm gas lighting


3. Having a very selective memory, where they‚Äôll recall something that‚Äôs either half true; out of context, or missing a crucial details, or things that are flat out not their response at the time. Like things in writing that happened over text. 

4. Hyper sensitivity that is difficult to predictZ Let‚Äôs say, we‚Äôre having a convo, I‚Äôll tease them or give them a ribbing, they‚Äôll laugh and even tease back and play along, then the next day they‚Äôll come back after having thought about it very hurt and angry at me for saying something that in no way was indicated to me was offensive. It makes it very confusing what‚Äôs okay and not okay and what lines are not okay to cross.

"I've often characterized myself as a social chameleon, trying to blend in with people I like, want to create attachments with. But I don't often feel like I've often actually succeed in connecting... Maybe because my own identification with my interests, hobbies, and likes are so weak or dependent? There are things I dislike, yes, but what I like? Things I want to do, who I want to be? Much of that is a big question mark.

The people I do connect with... If they have a strong personality, they don't sense the lack of genuine connection because maybe theyre too focused on feeding off the validation I give them by way of mirroring- (which I do b/c it makes my sense of identity feel more developed/stronger)? And if I connect with a weaker personality, are they just making me comfortable by way of accepting that the things I do (what I studied, what i know, my career, my politics, and philosophy) is *who I am;* much like I myself have assumed for so long? They just aren't aware of it via naivette?

I imagine, and maybe this is obvious, that those who are aware and have a healthy sense of what genuine, healthy connection feels like can sense when my attempts to connect feel unnatural, and avoid; maybe that's why I feel so alienated from those I perceive as normal- those who I most desire to connect with.

Do I rarely have more than one 'good friend' b/c I get uncomfortable when the ""light"" of each of their personalities casts my shadow in different directions? Or when I'm in a social crowd or group? I don't know who I am, which shadow I'm supposed to be among all the lights?",bpd_disorder

"I‚Äôve (22f) been recently diagnosed with bpd and am currently dating a guy (25m) I met on tinder about a month ago.

We‚Äôve only gone on 4 dates and haven‚Äôt had a talk yet about making things more serious or anything, but I was wondering when a good time to bring up the fact that I have bpd would be a good idea.

On top of that I don‚Äôt even know how to explain it to him/how much detail I should go into. I‚Äôm terrified of scaring him off.",bpd_disorder
"hi. this is my first reddit post because i don't know where else to go for help, every time i try to find help for bpd i just find endless mean posts so i thought i'd try here. sorry if posts like this have already been made, i don't have the energy to look for them, and it might be a bit long, whoops :S  


i've been trying really hard to control my bpd outbursts since i went on an amazing, safe acid trip where i had an opportunity to reflect and heal. in short, i realised i could be a better person and i WANT to be a better person, and it's achievable. i've been practicing meditative techniques, mindfulness and anything i can to accept what emotions i'm going through but be patient and not act on them. i'm sure this isn't unusual, but it's incredibly hard for me as im impulsive and have big issues controlling myself (and my anger especially). small things can make me majorly pissed off and once the ball starts rolling it's very difficult to get it to stop.   


to combat this i've been using this every time someone annoys me i remind myself that i don't need to create conflict in a non hostile situation, i just need to accept my feelings, focus on my breathing and stay patient with people.  


today, i was explaining something to someone close to me over text, and starting to get annoyed as they were beginning to confuse me and seemed confused about what i was saying or something, despite me being very clear. i asked what they found confusing, and they said after that i had been rude when i asked that. they know i have bpd, they've seen me at my worst and i just exploded. i couldn't control myself and immediately started being horrible and venomous, saying i was trying my absolute best to be polite and if they think im rude i could show them what 'rude' really is. i then collapsed in a heap crying and on the verge of a panic attack as i realised no matter what i do or how hard i try to be a better person it isn't good enough for people and never will be.   


at times like this it really hurts because it's almost like i've tricked myself into thinking i've made progress and stuff like this makes me have immediate hurtful thoughts towards myself, makes me start hurting myself and just reminds me that i cant make progress and never will.

 it hurts because it's so fucking hard for me to control myself, and yet i've tried so hard and i hadn't started any conflict or had a bpd episode in what feels like a while now. but even though it is a lot of effort to me, non bpd people take this for granted and percieve me as rude even when im trying my absolute best to not let me annoyance get the best of me and to be polite instead of getting angry. even though the person explained that they see now i wasn't being rude and they misread the tone of the text, it doesn't change anything for me and i still feel like a failure. in my head, it makes me feel like the effort isn't even worth it and i should just let my bpd steer because at the end of the day it clearly doesnt make a difference to other people if i do or dont (even though i know this is probably untrue). but it's still a horrible mindset and i hate it  


if anyone has experience with stuff like this, how do i stop these kinds of situations from ruining my progress/pushing my progress back as i try to recover from this disorder and keep up my self control? im so sick of bpd ruining my life and relationships daily :( i don't know what else to do. thanks for reading all of this",bpd_disorder
"My boyfriend and i are going onto 4 years together with a daughter. We werent in a very good place i felt like i wasnt being appreciated. He was calling me beautiful and it just felt so nice being noticed. I fely like i didnt really matter. i was flirting with the guy over messages. My boyfriend found out and thats when bad went to worst. What i did was wrong i didnt mean to hurt him like i did. Ive done alot of bad things in my life and i think this is really the only regret i have.

We wanted to work things out so we stuck together but he would randomly think about the words used between us. (Nothing crude was said there were no nudes sent. We were calling eachother beautiful and handsome. Still doesnt make it right though.) 

Fast forward to January. By that point i lost my job and the people who we were renting from was selling the house. We ended up having covid so we couldnt exactly go to house viewings or anything like that so we went to the town his parents lived in and we r currently staying with them. My boyfriend ended up rupturing his intestine so he had to have an emergency surgery. The doctor said hes lucky hes alive. He went 4 days like that and if he waited he would of died. 

He was in the hospital for a week. He was being really sweet and he was complementing me telling me how much he loved me. Stupid me didnt realize it was because he was really vulnerable. Then out of no where he starts thinking about me and the guy i was texting. So now when we find a place hes going to a completely different province to his friends place and he wants to take a trial split to see if he will miss me. Told me if i want to see other guys im more than welcome. 

I just feel so stupid for following him to a town i have no one in hes going to be gone for an undetermined amount of time and our daughter wont have her dad around again. My anxiety and depression are eating me alive and im dealing with it on my own. I dont have the luxury of not being ok like he can i have to be there for our child but its so damn hard. Im 3 days on my new medication i hope it helps but i just dont know what to do it feels like my life is falling apart. 
I dont want anyone els i just want him.

How do i handle this stress. Everything seemed so fine now he hardly wants me to touch him. Im just so confused idk if im over reacting or not to this.",bpd_disorder
"My (29f) husband (27m) and I had an argument over our finances that ended with me crying hysterically and being told by him that he‚Äôs sick of my bullshit. The argument started because I had called his sister to vent about my concerns that he just doesn‚Äôt care about my mental health, his spending is out of hand and we need to save money to get a car so I can get back to work and so we can move out of his mother‚Äôs. I‚Äôve said it to everyone I have talked to and I‚Äôll be the first to admit that I have a spending issue myself, but I‚Äôve been working towards becoming more strict and cracking down on frivolous spending. I can‚Äôt talk to him without there being some type of argument, I‚Äôm just glad that I don‚Äôt resort to physical fighting anymore. It‚Äôs been a rough time, but I‚Äôve made a lot of changes the past few years to be more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, but when things become too much, I‚Äôm too stressed, or anything, I shut down and want left alone to have my feelings and process stuff on my own. I‚Äôm just really hurt by him saying he‚Äôs sick of my bullshit (he said he didn‚Äôt mean mental health, he meant the way I act in arguments, or how I‚Äôll talk to his sister and his mom or my therapist and he‚Äôs always the last to find out. It‚Äôs just hard to talk to him because we end up arguing whenever I voice my concerns. I feel like a failure because I can‚Äôt be different and because I am trying to communicate healthily, but it always comes back to bite me in the ass.

"Hi so me and this guy have been together for now 8 months. He‚Äôs been very vocal about his bpd since the beginning of the relationship. Hes told me that he has abandonment issues and hes scared to be hurt. I reassured him by telling him that i would never do that because i grew up in a toxic environment like that and i know how it can hurt people and destroy them. 

Hes my first love and honestly i saw my future with him. But recently i found out that hes been sleeping with other people from dating sites and that hes been flirting with girls from his past. I took some time to think about leaving him but honest i dont want to. Im willing to forgive and try to understand him. A pattern that i saw when i searched his phone is that hes always looking for validation and he likes attention. Hes told me in the past that he likes the excitement of flirting with people. 

Im here to ask advice on how i should confront him about the cheating part. should i get the proof to him if hes denies it? Should i explain to him how hurt i am or should i just break up with him? If i break up, should i be aware of some tricks he may pull to manipulate the situation? Should i cry? Should i stay calm? 

The truth is that i really dont want to lose him and i want to show him that im there for him, but i also dont want to be gaslighted and manipulated or even taking for granted for wanting to help him. Im also asking for advice because when he gets mad, he gets impulsive and says things to hurt me but i never react because i know its out of anger and hes feeling everything at the same time.  I also need to say that i really do feel his love towards me but now im just confused.",bpd_disorder

"My (Ex) Best friend and I both have BPD and we met in rehab. Over time we got really close and spent almost all our free time together. We were in contact every day and could always talk to each other about any subject.
This was the best friendship I've ever had, she was the only one who truly understood me and my crazy behaviour. We supported each other through ups and lows, and I love her so much as a person. We basically were each others favourite person, and both actually aware of it.

After a while she developed feelings for me (she's pansexual) and confessed to me afterall. I told her that I love her to, but more like a sister. I fully support gay rights, but I'm just not into women myself. She accepted it, but I could tell how hurt she was anyways. We continued to be best friends tho. 

Fast forward a few months, we got into this situation where we basically both liked the same guy. 
Looking back I think it really hurt her to see how in love I was with him while I couldn't develop feelings for her. At least that makes sense in my BPD brain.
Things got really messy and we had a fright. We agreed to minimise contact for a while until things had cooled down. 

I tried to call her after like a week. I wanted to make up, tell her that I missed her and that I don't want a guy to come between us. She was really cold and the conversation didn't last long. A few days later I asked her if she wanted to go to the mall with me. She declined and told me that she didn't want to act like nothing happened. That I'm a liar, a bad friend and she basically wants nothing to do with me anymore. She mentioned a few points where I had lied in the past (insignificantdetails details that had nothing to do with her) and that she had enough. When I got upset and started crying she blocked me on everything. 

Eversince that happened I tried to contact her with different accounts and apologise a few times, but she's always blocked me without any response. I checked her social media with a fake account, and she has since gotten together with the guy we both liked. He's blocked me everywhere to. Also I contacted a mutual friend of ours a few days ago, and the friend basically told me that I can go f*** myself and that she doesn't want anything to do anymore either. She was very mean, and I think my Ex BFF is talking shit to her behind my back. 

Even tho she treated me unfair I still miss her so much. I've been a bullied loner without friends for all my childhood and teen years. It felt so good to finally have a friend to trust, and it hurts even more now that she's gone. It hurts even more than any breakup I've ever had.

I'm still checking her social media every once in a while. It might sound crazy, but I can't fully let go yet. I feel like she's full on splitting on me, and she might actually be convinced that I am a terrible person. But I'm not what she makes me out to be and I've never even had the chance to explain my side of the story. 

I don't know how to cope at all. It's very hard for me to make friends and I have nobody to talk to now. I feel like it will take years to find a real friend again. Maybe one day I'll get over it, but it's still a very long way.",bpd_disorder

Now it‚Äôs ruined everything I keep getting to this point where if I‚Äôm too emotionally invested in my feelings for someone I have to eventually tell them even though I shouldn‚Äôt and it will ruin everything. I literally can‚Äôt control my emotions and have to tell the person. But I didn‚Äôt want anything to happen I just had to say it so I can stop thinking about it.

"Hi. 22f, diagnosed BPD, anxiety, depression, and ADHD

I recently just caught my (now) ex-boyfriend cheating on me, and I was in a very bad depressive episode for a couple days. 

I now have a surge of energy, hyperfocusing on activities, going on spending sprees, and having racing thoughts. Mostly feelings of grandiosity. I feel very similar to a 4 month long episode I had back the last time I  was cheated on. In this 4 month long episode I was engaging in unusual/impulsive sexual behavior, drinking daily, and overall impulsive behaviors. Also feelings of grandiosity, blah blah. 

My mind feels a little more contained right now because I took 1 mg of ativan, and I took my 10 mg of adderrall around 10 am this morning. Also took my 20 mg of lexapro this morning as I do daily.

It's like my mind just flipped a switch, and I feel so energized and I just wanna dance. I wonder if I am exhibiting early signs of a manic episode, or this is just my diagnosed BPD.

Thanks! Also if anyone has tips on how to calm down and be a little more stable, please let me know. I feel good but I know it's going to come with a crash",bpd_disorder
"My biggest goal in life has always been to start a family. I started setting aside money from a pretty young age and if my partner didn't want kids it was an instant deal breaker - even though I'm in my early twenties and didn't plan to have kids until I'm 28-30 y/o.

A few weeks ago, this dream of mine just...went away. I even feel reluctant about getting pregnant and I absolutely don't want to go through the progress of pregnancy anymore. I have no idea how this happened, I don't think I've gotten triggered by anything. My relationship of 3 years is stronger and healthier than ever before.
I'm still open to adoption, but my partner would only want biological children.

When a sudden, big change like this happens, is it even real? Was the first one the fake one? Will it revert back someday?

This complete change of mind scares the hell out of me. That shit is ""Who the fuck am I?"" on a whole different level. I haven't told my partner because I don't know if this is real and I don't want to scare him away.",bpd_disorder

I‚Äôm currently looking at different DBT options, there‚Äôs a mix of in person and online available as the pandemic tapers off.

Although more convenient, I‚Äôm a bit dubious about the online one because I struggle to hold attention vs an in-person programme where it‚Äôs easier to focus and connect. 

How have your DBT programs been over Covid? Would love a comparison if anyone has experienced both. 

For in-person, was it good to forge relationships with people in similar situations? Definitely something that‚Äôs harder to do online.

Also have considered that I have BPD as well, as I have a LOT of the symptoms. Anyways so as I was saying, my anxiety has been awful lately. It probably has a lot to do with me starting a new waitressing job, which is a lot for me to take in. I‚Äôm also still a college student, so trying to balance these all is a  huge struggle for me. The cherry on top of all of this is that I just found out today my mom possibly has cancer. All of this together sent me spiraling, full on shaking, sobbing and I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath for a while. I just feel like I‚Äôm at such a loss and I‚Äôm very scared of what is to come.

After she left I didn‚Äôt think i‚Äôd ever move up, did stupid shit, ended up in the psych ward because I was upset and dealing with other stuff as well at the time.

My mental health was at all time low and I was undiagnosed with BPD and bipolar so I was unmediated which made me so much worse, I can‚Äôt blame her for leaving. I was terrible, I was borderline yandere levels of jealousy.

but since then i‚Äôve learned that it gets easier, you can move on from a person, sure i‚Äôve thought countless times of what life would have been like with her but molding my life around her, mimicking her ideals and what she want isn‚Äôt me, wasn‚Äôt me.

i‚Äôm almost thankful she dumped me, made me learn things, made me realize we would have never worked but that‚Äôs okay, I moved on and maybe she did too.

"Hi there everyone, hope you're all well. 

So today I kind of want to know more about being being in relationship with someone who has BPD. I've been seeing this girl for a few months now and I've really fallen in love with her and she says she has with me too. I'll be honest, I've never fallen for someone like this before and I've had a few relationships prior, something she has also said about me. From the start she has been open about suffering with BPD for quite a while, something that has never bothered me really. 

At the start of our relationship, we fell for each other very quickly and it was certainly very 'cute' and 'romantic'. We still have these moments now but occasionally she can have episodes of being almost apathetic and this can last up to a week or so and then she'd go back to the person I got to know again. But when she does get like that, I'ts like she does not love me at all and I almost feel like an inconvenience. She also has episodes of feeling like she is being abandoned or, that I will break up with her. On these occasions I always reassure her that is not what I intend to do and am aware this is a major aspect of BPD. 

But what took my by suprise was the episodes of apathy, it's like she just does not care about me when she goes into one. It does bother me sometimes as I am very sensitive person who likes to give a lot of love to whoever I am seeing. So when it isn't reciprocated I can get insecure or upset and times. 

I have read up on BPD a bit and, although correct me if I have misinterpreted this, under the understanding that those who suffer with it fall for people very quickly as if it's love and then the relationship eventually breaks up a short while after. Does this happen? and does that imply my GF does not actually love me in the conventional sense? If any of this causes offence by the way, I am very sorry but don't have much experience with dealing with this and only heard things off others. 

So what I want to know is this part of BPD? How do I deal with it properly and is there anything else I should expect? I really love her and I just want to make sure I do things right around her. Thank you for reading this.",bpd_disorder

"Is is a thing for people with BPD to split on appearance? I was bullied a lot for my appearance a lot, and I feel like I can either only look what society stereotypes as ""amazing"" or ""ugly"". I wish I didn't care about my appeance in terms of things I can't control, but I do. It makes me feel good to feel like I look stereotypically attractive. I actually feel attractive, but I have an unstable view of my facial features and am terrified of people thinking I look ""creepy"". I always felt like my appearance scared people in school. It doesn't help I am likely on the autism spectrum and that made me come across as creepy with my demeanor on accident.

Is it normal to split with your appearance? Either looking ""amazing"" or ""ugly"". I believe everyone is attractive in their own way, except for me. I have to look amazing to not hate myself.",bpd_disorder
"Hello,

I was doing this study that looked at the effects of sleep on individuals with symptoms of BPD and I was qualified because I seemed to fit a good portion of the symptoms so it got me thinking about maybe going to therapy because of it. The issue is that I'm unsure whether I'm lying about these symptoms to be able to get the diagnosis or whether I actually genuinely have these symptoms and I'm not trying to just appease to whatever idea I have in my brain? Did anybody have this issue before going to therapy ?",bpd_disorder
"people can stand to be in a room with you. The people I've treated with BPD are insufferable.""

This is what my brother's therapist thought would be appropriate to say to me about my diagnosis. I repeat: not even my therapist, my *brother's therapist.*

She went on to explain that my symptoms are more reflective of severe PTSD. I've never even met this woman! How would she even know?!

Honestly, I'm offended. What is it with so many of these therapists and their insistence that people like me are inherently bad? Why the snobby remark that I can't have BPD because I'm not an intolerable person?! Ugh.  Reeeeeally feeling the BPD stigma today. 

I'm glad *my* therapist isn't an a-hole.",bpd_disorder

You can see my post history for a full backstory cause Ive told and typed this story so many times today. On top of having a bad judgemental therapist, her office has scammed me out of so much money. I‚Äôm so hurt. Idk what to do I feel devastated. Therapy isn‚Äôt even safe :(

Everyone always asks me, why I‚Äôm so angry all the time. Because I‚Äôm constantly being betrayed. They were so rude to me.

February 3

Today I woke up as I have all too often lately‚Äîfeeling nervous and anxious, desperately overcome with the urge to get out of the house. Luckily, I had \[a work thing\] in the morning to give me somewhere to be. Less sleep than I might have wanted led me to be a bit tired this morning as I made my way to \[the work thing\]. In my tired, caffeine deprived state, I began my day in the state of mind that I have become all too familiar with of late. Feeling lonely, disconnected, and like something is wrong with me.

I‚Äôm hungry and cold. My body feels tense. Sick almost. I don‚Äôt want a greasy breakfast sandwich from McDonald‚Äôs, but I settle for it. Before I can make it to Starbucks, I have a moment in my car where I feel briefly overwhelmed. I sit in languish, attempting to nap or to meditate, but I am unable to turn off the thoughts‚Äîthe endless racking of my brain for moments in my life that might serve as an indication that I am, always have been, and always will be unwell. I find plenty of examples. I have an entire arsenal of experiences, feelings and vignettes that prove that I am a hollow, unaware, and selfish. Thoughts of failures in relationships both big and small, momentary (or not so momentary) lapses of self-awareness or moments where I have succumbed to holding on to ill will toward others. Moments where I failed to see a whole human, instead focusing on their imperfections. Are these moments just caused by a lifelong combination of (social) anxiety, ADD, depression and a lack of wisdom or maturity? Or is there one thing that ties it all together? I shudder at the thought there may be something that is a part of me that means I will always make the same mistakes.

It seems that in the last several months (really the last two years) because of back to back deployments, moving to a new country, COVID, and pay issues. I have been so stressed, so angry, so unsatisfied with life, so lonely that it has caused me to relentlessly (whether I want it or not) search my mind. I‚Äôm remembering parts of my life that I thought I had buried. Parts that I have tried so desperately to leave in the past. I‚Äôm remembering these moments in a subconscious attempt to find the common thread that defines me.

Do I have a disease? Am I destined to feel empty, unfulfilled, alone and anxious my whole life?

Maybe I simply haven‚Äôt spent enough time thinking of others. Maybe, because I‚Äôve spent my entire life attempting to define myself by the things I do, the jokes I make, my ‚Äúastute observations‚Äù however astute they may actually be, and my ambitions, maybe I‚Äôve been missing the point by not thinking of other people. This thought sticks with me as I go through my day.

I try to focus on presence. If I start to feel anxious I find something to ground me. I begin to wonder if maybe presence also means something larger. Maybe it means living in the moment. Not in the sense of going out and being wild, but in the sense that maybe I should spend some time focusing on my job and the people around me, instead of focusing what I lack and what I could have or where I could be that would make me happier.

I get home and I lay on the couch. For twenty minutes, I consciously take time to think about all of the people in my life that love me. I think of their imperfections, and I wish them well. Maybe if I make a habit of this, I can train myself to think more of others. Let us hope.",bpd_disorder
"I recently participated in a Stanford study looking into how the ketogenic diet affects schizophrenic and bipolar individuals across a 4 month period. The consensus so far is as long as you refrain from and other substances that affect your brain balance significantly like caffeine and nicotine while being strict on the food plan you can get a significant improvement on your mood symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason I say this is because I found out I was misdiagnosed with bipolar 2 and I'm actually a pwBPD but still found the significant benefits as seen in what is described above. Only difference is that its a lot easier to calm down from mood swings and they are in less severity/duration with more mental clarity. While also fixing my binge eating urges for the most part, for some reason my brain can't tell itself its full when it comes to carbs and sugar, but with fat, it somehow can read that.

&amp;#x200B;

The results from the study so far are very positive with high success rates which is awesome considering its a larger group study compared to past studies on this topic. There is also an identical study planned in Europe starting sometime later this year. Given the success continues, it can be transformative in mental health treatment.

"Soooo I have BPD and I‚Äôm also a huge Nine Inch Nails fan and while most of NIN‚Äôs songs basically sound like they were written by a Borderline, this song REALLY describes it, every single word.  It‚Äôs called The Big Come Down:

Smash it apart
Just for the fuck of it

Gotta get back to the bottom

Find a place with the failed and forgotten

"Kinda trying to laugh at it, but also like that shit irritates me so deeply. 

I found out today i need surgery to remove a cyst. This is the second cyst removal surgery i will be having, but this cyst is located where the sun don‚Äôt shine so of course i‚Äôm upset about it. 

I‚Äôve had a handful of surgeries in the last 7-8 years, the last one being brain surgery. Of course, i‚Äôm tired of being in and out of hospital for medical and psychiatric reasons. Of course i‚Äôm complaining about it. I‚Äôm tired man!!! You would be too if you had chronic health issues!!!!

I posted on my close friends story that i have to have surgery again. I‚Äôve had a polinidal cyst re-appear 3 times and it‚Äôs made it hard for me to walk, sit, and is just generally painful. Went to urgent care and was given a referral to schedule surgery ASAP. 

Mostly posted on my close friends because my close friends is how i communicate with my friends because they know i get weird about directly telling them things, especially when it comes to my health issues it causes me a lot of anxiety. So this person IMMEDIATELY hopped on twitter like ‚ÄúWhy is it everybody always complaining on close friends???? It‚Äôs only ever depression and porn‚Äù

Man lol even tho i complain about my pain i didn‚Äôt complain on my close friends! i just made a joke about how mother nature said i‚Äôm overdue for surgery since my last was in 2019 (lol)

I used to complain a lot i try to catch myself but the redundancy of complaining about someone complaining is hilarious to me lmao. Especially when it‚Äôs more an announcement that i need help than complaining!!! 

Also, like i‚Äôm sorry you feel that way. Not everybody‚Äôs fucking life is happiness and sunshine though. And i‚Äôm really fucking upset that people expect that all the fucking time. Especially somebody who i KNOW has been in therapy and apparently just graduated from therapy.

I dont know why my brain is especially hard on them and whenever they dont like up to my frankly impossible expectations I hate them.

Thankfully I never act my feelings out because I'm honestly just too cowardly to do so.

But anyway, I was just thinking that even if I never let my frustrations out on them its very unfair for me to do that. I've never really discussed this with my therapist but I want to know if it would be even worth doing. Has therapy helped you with idealizing/devaluating people?",bpd_disorder
"B for Borderline

At first they tell you they understand you. They give you that reassurance you need.
Things change, People change. But the borderline stays the same. 

You feel so comfortable when they tell you, ""I wont leave, no matter how hard it gets"". You feel so warm when they say, ""they will forever love you"".

I can't be the only one who holds onto those words with a single thread. It only takes a tug or a slight pull for you to snap.

Do you feel that? All that love turned into hate in an instant. Like a shooting star, we go up together and I am sitting in my own paranoia, waiting for the moments to turn into a nostalgic 
burst.

We are now nothing but broken memories. I am a hopeless romantic. Maybe I don't care about the hurt. The things I will do to replay those broken records in real time.

It is unhealthy for my heart but, I swear I need it. Too much of everything is too bad for you, they say. But you are just enough... My boo, my bae, you get all my time.

"Feel free to chime in. 

‚ÄúWhy am I anxious avoidant? Why do I hyper analyze everything I do? Why do I bottle things up and leave it to go unprocessed?‚Äù

I was raised in an environment where I was constantly invalidated. By my parents, siblings, and peers. There was never any other outside forces pushing against those beliefs.

"If I read an article about BPD sufferers in relationships, it is like I'm reading an article written exactly about my GF.  The emotions are complete roller coasters...

One minute she's all over me and telling me how amazing I am, the next her eyes glaze over and she's literally telling me she hates me and I don't love her.  She will spend hours coming at me with every possible thought she can dig up, every piece of evidence, that convinces her I don't love her.  Hours are spent talking, sometimes arguing, about her feelings and needs and thoughts.

When she wants sex, we MUST have it right then and there or she will feel completely rejected and become angry.  When she doesn't want sex or to even hear my voice, there can be days that go by where there is almost no contact at all.  

I've tried to subtly hint and directly suggest that she get therapy and perhaps there is a disorder that would explain her emotional dysregulation but she insists it is just anxiety (she takes meds for this) and becomes VERY angry and tells me to never, ever suggest something is ""wrong"" with her again.

""The worst possible thing you could do that would end this relationship besides cheating is to tell me something is wrong with me and I need to get some help.""  

Yet, we are going on 1 year of the same cycles.  Week after week, day after day, an almost clockwork like cycle of love/hate, with very predictable responses to situations and my actions during those phases.

"Please pull no punches. I'm currently 27 and she is 25.

My girlfriend and I were living together for just over a year. She has significant trauma that she was working through, then without help. Things were getting hard in early 2021 - I was overwhelmed with grad school, work, and feeling responsible for her emotions and well being. I shamefully admit I was not good. Yelling, throwing things...I got the cops called on me a couple times by neighbors.    Thankfully, I never hurt her, though I'm sure my words hurt. In March of 2021 she moved out with our dog while I was at work, and I came home to a hollow home.

That hurt. I get her reasons. We did an on/off thing for about six months afterwards that culminated in me breaking up with her the day before her birthday. Probably the worst thing I've ever done in my life. I still feel awful, but I really think I needed to. I felt stuck in the same patterns that I knew would drive me insane, that I knew would lead to us crying together over our broken hearts once again. She wants to get married and have kids, and I couldn't give her that reassurance.

We didn't talk for months. I thought about her, literally every day. I slept with someone on Tinder, could barely get it up, and thought about my girl the entire time. I sat with that for another couple months. 

I realized that I still love her. I realized I do want kids. I thought I had answers. I reached out, and we got coffee. Before I could say anything, she told me that she's learned she has borderline (she started therapy after she moved out). 

And now I don't have answers. And I've been loving getting to talk to my friend, loving seeing her smile, loving hearing her thoughts, and so terrified of what might happen. I don't want us to get hurt. I don't want to lose her. I want the best for her, and I worry that my emotional inconsistency (ADHD) will never be able to give her what is best for her. I've recently learned that I'm a codependent, making it even harder for me to trust what I myself am thinking.

She came over today, which was amazing just getting to share some space while we each worked. And then she brought up the future, and commitment, and I...couldn't give her that reassurance, and I think butchered an explanation of how I was still processing her having borderline, which she (understandably) seemed to take personally. I teach elementary special ed, so I have a tendency to clinicize.

I just...fuck. I love her. I really do. I just don't know if I'm the right partner; if I even can be, despite what she thinks. I want her to be happy, to have the life she wants for herself. I want her in my life. I don't know what to do. 

So I'm yelling into the void. Advice, insight, or maybe you just want to yell at me for being a fucking asshole. I'll take all of it - hopefully I can learn something, understand more, or better. I'll try to answer any questions if you have them. Thank you for reading, truly.",bpd_disorder

"Hello, I'd like to get insight from people who had an experience with diagnosed bpd and its treatment regarding the current situation I'm in with my mental health, and especially with my therapist. I'll try to describe the situation as clearly as possible without making the post too long.

I'm a 21 year old girl, I've been in therapy since I was 19 (never got diagnosed with anything because my first therapist didn't have the tools to do so), I've switched therapists in September 2021 because the public healthcare service that provided therapy for me had reached the maximum number of meetings they could give me (I'm still in public healthcare, just another service). I struggle with a lot of things that are listed as bpd symptoms/experiences, but I've never brought the hypothesis up to either of my therapists because I didn't want it to come across as self-diagnosing since I'm strongly against it.

Anyways, recently my mental health declined radically, I started having intrusive thoughts which lead to very debilitating anxiety, derealization and panic attacks, therefore I went to a psychiatric urgent care meeting. I only disclosed the debilitating symptoms, expecting them to either think I had no illness at all and just a high level of stress or something related to anxiety, instead they began asking me questions and immediately brought up bpd to me as a possible diagnosis (obviously it's not confirmed, but they want me to be followed by a psychiatrist and get tested + observed further), which took me by surprise.

The issue at hand is that my therapist always seems to kinda downplay/dismiss things - the week before I started having panic attacks she said she thought I could get better by therapy alone and could go without meds, and when we talked about what the psychiatrist had told me she said that a lot of the things are just probably a generational thing (isn't 21 an age where you can get diagnosed though?), etc. Partially it's on me because I've never been good at expressing what's going on in my head, or at least the intensity or relevancy of my issues, because I don't want others to worry or to come off as dramatic. Now I'm waiting for the psychiatrist to call me back to start our meetings, but in the meantime, am I reading too much into this by feeling dismissed by my therapist? Is it my fault because I'm not able to express myself properly in therapy? How should I go about this, besides obviously waiting to start a proper psychiatric journey? Any insight would be helpful!",bpd_disorder
"Hey! I struggle a lot with the ""unstable identity"" and ""emptiness"" symptoms of the disorder. Most of the time, I have no clue who I am and what I want, and I have episodes where I feel like a gaping void of nothingness.

"Hey guys, I've been recently diagnosed with BPD and my therapist said that one of the diagnostic criteria is distorted thinking.

Not long ago I was paranoid that my mom would find out that I sleep with my bf (I was 20 lol) or send him nudes. Like if they would take my phone and see the evidence. I knew that there wouldn't be anything bad but for whatever reason I was afraid

Or that I was pregnant. I was so stressed. There was little evidence supporting that fact but I was so stressed. I was almost convinced that it was true, though at some level understood that the chances are low

Also right now I kinda get brief thoughts when I am stressed that it would have been nice if my boss would kiss me or that everybody hates me.

"After spending many years having failed relationships with women, I‚Äôd always find someone or something to blame other than myself for the demise of each one. 

I started to see a pattern. She might say or do something that is completely safe and ok, but I would find every reason how she‚Äôs sabotaging/manipulating me for whatever stupid gain. Whether it be cheating or just not concerned with me or my feelings, I felt I was getting the short end of the stick. I‚Äôd raise my voice, verbally beat her down, and let her know every reason she fucked up. Then, I‚Äôd try to make up for yelling. This kept happening every single time. She may tolerate me bitching a couple of times but after a while, the relationship would get stale and I‚Äôd be wondering why. That always made it worse. As I try to do what I feel is the right thing to do to bring her back, it just made it worse‚Ä¶.

This last relationship, the girl was cool as a fan. I ruined it of course and it drove me to depression and I relapsed. I overdosed and was lucky to be saved.

I have a (8f) daughter. I‚Äôm currently 11weeks pregnant. I got a little triggered today and all day it‚Äôs been affecting me. I did some self reflecting and realized this wasn‚Äôt my first rodeo. Whenever something doesn‚Äôt go my way I have these outburst. I try to be controlling towards the ones I love around me. I have played the victim before many times. I do acknowledge whenever I‚Äôm out of line but not all the time. There are times where I do try and work on myself.  Then I have these setbacks. I even have moments questioning who the hell am I? How come I haven‚Äôt started in my career yet? Why do I barely have any motivation left in me? I dwell on the past. I‚Äôm not always in the moment. I have low self esteem. I have trouble concentrating. I don‚Äôt have a whole lot of trust in myself. I rely on my boyfriend and the way he makes me feel grounded. This leads me to what triggered me earlier today. My boyfriend (26M) and I got into an argument. We rarely argue and whenever we do it‚Äôs over minor things, but the problem it‚Äôs me who picks the arguing. He does his best to be patient with me, hear me out, try to understand and deescalate the situation but I don‚Äôt let it go. I drag it on and just end up making my boyfriend feel the pain and misery I‚Äôm feeling, in that moment.

"""Empath"" just means you're basing your self worth around whether or not people like you. It's still all about you. It's still all about how much you feel like you're worth. You're just a sociopath with extra steps that you feel like make you a better person when all they really do is reveal to you what that mindset is really worth.

""Empath."" Whatever. Go ahead and pretend your selfish world is actually about other people. It's not. You never actually figured that out. You just added an extra layer to pretend like you're capable of caring about others beyond how they impact you (and your own sense of self)

You told me everyone always leaves you or you push them away. I stayed, I waited. You said you would never lie to me. You told me there was no one else. But, the day that you left, I felt it. I felt the uncertainty within you, you were looking at options. I chose you as my only option. I betrayed the love I finally had for myself again, for you. I was disloyal to myself to protect you. You did to me what I told you I never wanted done to me again, you re-traumatized me. When my cptsd started getting really bad again, you said I was to unstable for you.

I'm asking about the process of getting diagnosed, because I just had to fill out a questionnaire about personality disorders and got diagnosed with BPD in my first therapy session.

"I got diagnosed around six months ago. I was in a mental health clinic for 8 weeks and got diagnosed with BPD after two weeks, two therapy sessions and a questionnaire. After this, I had constantly changing therapists, and no one would/could answer my questions about which diagnostic criteria I fulfill in detail. 

I'm not in therapy right now, because I couldn't find a spot anywhere (it's tough to find one, where I live) and so I don't have any way to talk to a professional about it. But I read about it a lot and looked at posts of people experiencing BPD and their experiences don't match mine at all. 

I also read, that BPD is hard to diagnose. So how could I be diagnosed after one questionnaire and one therapy session? Why wasn't I tested for literally anything else? I didn't even get a depression or anxiety questionnaire, only the one for personality disorders. I can't help but to feel mistreated and misdiagnosed.

One side is the most kind, gentle, bubbly person I have ever met (the one I fell in love with) and the other is this incredibly evil entity. When she's triggered and in an ""episode"" she lashes out and breaks things, screams and says the most hurtful, horrible things to me.

I'm trying my best to understand because I know she had an extremely rough childhood and this all stems from the way she was treated as a child but at what point do you look at yourself and realize you need to make a change? That you can't treat the person who loves you the way you were treated it doesn't make it okay. Basically where I'm at now is do I stay and try to figure it out with her or do I walk away? She always apologizes after these fights and seems to know what she's doing is wrong. She says she wants to make changes and has gotten onto a DBT waitlist and has downloaded some DBT apps.

We want to be together but we came to a final conclusion that It won‚Äôt benefit him nor me at the moment. We are both scared of the outcome It might bring If we went forward with the reconciliation.

Yes, my initial thoughts when everything went down were: ‚ÄúGet better for him so you two can be back together in 6 months or so‚Äù.

NO! I‚Äôm doing this for myself, that was my BPD talking. I‚Äôm getting better so my quality of living can improve, so I can flourish in the many aspects of life‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what exciting new things may come my way! The future is an indefinite concept, but I‚Äôm welcoming It with open arms.

He needed to let me go so I can prosper. And I needed to let him go and accept his decision because I love him and want to see him improve too. 

‚ÄúRight person, wrong time‚Äù never sounded more accurate. I‚Äôm already feeling a lot better, I‚Äôm glad we finally put an end to this. It‚Äôs a bittersweet kind of happiness.

We don‚Äôt know for sure if she has BPD or BP2 or MDD or something else or a mix (that‚Äôs why we need a professional opinion!!), but we do know that she has bad mood swings where the most trivial things irritate her. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where our youngest sister, who is only 13, is constantly nervous and scared of saying/doing the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù thing in case it makes S mad. When S is mad, she stops talking and interacting with everyone and can spend up to a week by herself in her room (this week long isolation has only started happening now in the winter). I feel so terrible for my youngest sister, who already lacks so much social interaction because she‚Äôs been doing school from home due to COVID and the most socializing she gets to do at home with her sisters usually leads to S getting mad. Every couple of weeks my 13 year old sister bursts into tears when S gets mad, and she‚Äôs beginning to expect anger from S now. I don‚Äôt get upset with S when she‚Äôs irritable because I know it‚Äôs hard for her, but my youngest sister thinks it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm showing favouritism to S. I don‚Äôt want to demonize S in any way because I love her and am trying to support her, but this is all hurting our youngest sister and it must be so much for a kid to go through. Any advice on how I can comfort my youngest sister?",bpd_disorder
"just need someone to tell me it'll be ok. that's all. 

i just feel physical pain right now because of how bad I'm hurting mentally. it feels like I'm grieving. it's so much emotion but I'm also numb at the same time. It hurts so bad and it's so agonizing I just want it to be over. it feels like I'm going crazy but I'm literally just sitting here all up in my head. it feels like everything is crashing down all at once. i don't know how to describe it. it just hurts, that's all I know. i feel like I'm just extremely messed up? i don't even know. 

i just need someone to tell me it'll be ok. i don't have the biggest support system in the world. i usually do things by myself. but right now I just need someone to tell me it'll be ok.

But that alone is a whole nother topic.

"So I have BPD and bipolar. I got into a huge fight with my FP. I asked her how my past drug addiction has affected her, and she felt like it was best not to talk about it due to how my mental state has been. I blew up at her in response. I blew up over something that could‚Äôve easily been resolved. She left me on read. (Which is understandable) I apologized this afternoon. Now that I‚Äôve calmed down, I see her side of the story.

"I just want to rant here because I am splitting and I don‚Äôt want to say anything stupid to my partner. 

I got sick while my partner was having a trip outside our city, so they prolonged the trip to make sure they didn‚Äôt get sick as well because they can‚Äôt miss any more school. When they came back, we decided to see each other because they were going to sleep in their sibling‚Äôs house for 4 more days (to not get sick) and we really missed each other. 

I bring them their things along with homemade pb cookies. We exchange gifts and talk, and then literally 10 minutes later they say they need to do homework and leave. I didn‚Äôt know this, I only knew they had class at 3 and I was expecting to hang out with them for a couple of hours. They said I didn‚Äôt have the right to get mad at them because school always comes first, and that school is necessary to fulfill their dream. Then I asked for reassurance asking ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt love me and don‚Äôt want to be with me right?‚Äù And instead of being like ‚Äúof course no baby, I love spending time with you‚Äù or something like that, they said ‚Äúwhy would this mean I don‚Äôt love you?‚Äù It felt like this was not reassurance, but my emotions being invalidated. I told them this and they asked how I wanted to be reassured, and I told them how and then they never said it, they just said they love me and left. I feel really shitty about the whole situation.

"He was my best friend for 4 years until he finally gave up on me and left my life two days before Christmas. He always told me he believes that I'm trying my best and that he wouldn't just abandon me over my BPD and Depression but it turns out he lied because now I'm all alone at the lowest point of my life. The friendgroup we had fell apart over this too. Only one of them still talks to me anymore and even then it's just surface level stuff. I thought I was doing a good job of pushing aside my feelings about this and finally accepting the fact that I'm on my own but today the friend I still talk to slipped and mentioned hanging out with him and all my feelings about this just came back right away like it just happened. Even worse my first instinct was to talk to him because he's the only person I was ever able to genuinely talk about my feelings with. I don't think I've ever felt this much pain at a FP leaving my life before.

Part of me really hates him for doing this to me after all the promises he made about staying forever and having a future together etc., knowing fully well about what it would do to me if he didn't keep them and then just discarding and replacing me instantly like it's nothing in the end but even then I still can't help but miss him I hate it. It feels like something I'll never be able to move past. Posting this here because I don't know where else to say it at this point. I just had to vent somewhere.",bpd_disorder
"It felt like that all my life.
Nice relationship of any kind, it ends, people get happier and do the things I wanted to do but we never did. When I'm around is like things don't flow and as soon as I leave they feel like falling in the right place. 
It's heartbreaking for me but I've come to accept it. Like, maybe it's a gift that I leave for the others. Bad thing is, I'm left alone again and sad. Which most of the times I need solitude to regain energy but the universe don't care. People is gonna be happy behind my back and sad on my face.
I'm really tired.
Maybe I'm not seeing the big picture or I'm missing something... I just can't understand.",bpd_disorder

"I have the dbt workbook by Matthew Mckay of amazon. I did have a therapist but i just found she invalidated my feelings and didn‚Äôt care at all so i‚Äôm going to start the workbook instead. I‚Äôm just wondering if you absolutely need a therapist to make progress? 

Has anybody tried anything else other than dbt that helped? I also did a group dbt but i hated it. Most of it was just speaking about mindfulness and listening to people feedback on homework but i HATE speaking out loud infront of people i was just anxious the whole time. 

Has anybody found themselves doing better by a workbook only?",bpd_disorder
"So for example, last night I had a meltdown and I don't even fully remember all of what I said, I just mentioned being sad at how we can't even wake up together on sleep calls, and so he obliged me that night.

However, during my mental breakdown I forgot his phone alarm can't go off during calls and he woke up late. I've apologized, for what little good that does, and I'm going to try harder to remember today whenever I get triggered by that again so this doesn't happen.

But.

There's also a huge time difference, we are exclusively long distance until we're both on our own, his family likes to control where he is and how he spends his time, and he also has an extremely hard time setting up boundaries or telling me no, no matter how much I beg and plead for him to tell me when something is wrong or if I'm doing something wrong. Sometimes, I even get the vague feeling that he uses my outbursts as a form of punishment for himself, though I suspect that's my paranoia talking.

So, the way his life is set up it's incredibly easy for me to split or break down because I get no time frames, I get no definite ""no""s, we're interrupted constantly, I put off sleep just to spend time with him and every mistake I make feels like the end of the world but I'm given no feasible way to fix things besides my assumption of just quietly holding back all of how I feel.

He wants to give me that time and attention and he's incredibly sweet, but at the same time the circumstances are so incredibly triggering, but my previous outbursts have made him wary of me even though I just want guidelines and rules so I have something to cling onto and something to ground me into reality.

I always have to make the rules and I'm so sick of it.

"I have an intense jealousy problem. I (24F) have a boyfriend (23M) who is also my FP. We live together for almost 2 years now. We've been trough a lot of shit because of my BPD but i can definitely say that he's the love of my life. But here is the problem i can't solve no matter how much i try to; i literally hate everyone he likes or cares ""too much"". I hate them if he tries ""too much"" to help them. I hate them if he wants us to spend time with them when i want to be alone with him (so it's almost always) he always invites me which is very nice but i still feel mad and jealous if he starts to see other people more than twice in a week. And i honestly don't know how much is ""too much"" for my BPD. It depends on the situation but the key point is when i feel like if he cares someone else, that person becomes a threat for me.

The problem is my fp spends most of their time with their partner and almost has no time to spend with me. It makes me devalue them and i really dont want that. I expressed myself about it but nothing changed, they still spend all day together and i feel so stupid. I dont know what to do or how to handle the fact that i'll never be my fp's first choice.

"Whenever someone behaves this way towards me I honestly want to explode. If someone makes a point of completely ignoring me to subtly hurt me or something it causes me so much pain and I struggle to control my anger (even though usually the anger is redirected towards myself usually).

The worst part of it is that it is verrrrry difficult to point out passive aggression without looking paranoid, since it isn't always visible and can easily be dismissed by the other person as me just looking for an argument. But, to me, it is worse than outright aggressive behaviour. I think this is because it triggers my internal feelings of worthlessness, and because it's usually done out of spite. It's not a sudden emotional reaction because they are hurting, it's a deliberate and manipulative way of hurting me in a way that is so subtle that I can't even point it out.

I am trying to limit the unnecessary anger and aggression that I feel on a daily basis, but there are some situations and people that I can't avoid. I currently live with someone who is incredibly passive aggressive and makes a point of trying to exclude me and it has caused me to have really intense anger attacks (by myself in my room).

I can feel my BPD flare up yet again, and I have promised myself I won't hurt him. I will try my best to not ruin it. 




Last night I send him a series of long texts. He tells me that he is v tired, and he will respond to them tomorrow. I was okay with it. 




Next day, he sends me memes, super cute texts, the usual. He didn't really look at the old texts. Mind you, this is morning and we have both been awake for a couple of hours maybe, and he has work. And I know it all. 




Immediately,  something inside me goes off, and I am on the other side. I am miserable, and I consider breaking up with him. I inflate everything,  and imagine really tragic scenarios. I plan to not respond for days, ghost him, etc. 




Thankfully, reason steps in for a split second. I could just remind him about last night. I could just .... communicate ? Woah genius. And I remind him, and everything is solved, and everything's fine again.

"26f here. 
10 years ago I was an absolute mess, and although you can't officially be diagnosed as a teenager, ""BPD"" was thrown around a lot as a term.
I was made to see a bunch of professionals, took some pills for some time, and even had a couple of weeks of  hospitalization.
But I did not want help, and I was not willing to actually truthfully talk to any of the professionals, because I knew exactly whats wrong with me but an admission would implode my life. I was extremely disappointed though that none of the professionals have brought up the possible root cause of my problems themselves because its a classic.
So overall, I never had any respect for professionals who should have helped. 

I mellowed out as I got older, but was still noticeably 'wrong', and I was happy enough staying as I am cause I just couldn't care less about any future.

2 years ago I made a leap of faith with someone, turned my whole life around, and have been pretending to be a functional adult being since with various degrees of success.
I have pets that depend on me, a kind of dream job, and a person I can see growing old with. He is aware of my problems.

But recently I can feel myself slipping.
I have more bad days than good ones, chores are getting pushed back more and more, and once in a while I will wake up in an almost catatonic state.
I can't afford to be a mess anymore because I have too much to lose. 

But I can't seem to get rid of my personal stigma against health workers. And I don't know what kind of treatment plan I would be able to take seriously and not just cynically dismiss. And also, I don't know if I can commit to trying to find a professional I can click with. 

I guess I would just like to hear your stories if you have experience similar to mine, of trying to get help in adulthood while having a lot of trust issues towards therapy.",bpd_disorder
"Hey everyone any input will be much appreciated,

Before I start in no way am I self diagnosing at all I'm just asking questions on how to go forth with what I say below.

I have struggled with alot of things especially in the area of emotions &amp; self image since I can remember. Currently I am diagnosed ASD (Aspergers for specifics) which at the time felt kind of fitting but I never thought the diagnoses criteria fully fit my symptoms. 

Over a few months ago I had gotten myself a girlfriend who is genuinely the best thing I've ever had in my life - she is diagnosed BPD and recently and after alot of talking I have opened up a little, like the shit terrifies me i usually avoid emotional stuff and keep it to myself as I've got a chronic fear of something bad happening from me expressing or talking about my feelings or being belittled or made to feel invalid on this and then said person leaving me, this has caused me to never develop a proper meaningful connection with anybody I feel soulless but with my girlfriend this is different and way more different than its ever been. I have only opened up genuinely only somewhat to her on my past ""trauma"" and experiences as of recent anyways as I feel finally ready to do so. She is honestly such a great person &amp; I feel as though I can finally let some out safely but this shit was still extremely hard to even somewhat let out.

Anyways because of her telling me of her diagnosis I took the time to do as much research on BPD as possible so I can understand her &amp; know what I need to do for her to be as comfortable as possible in any situation or type of mood she may be in and still feel loved and cared for in the process &amp; along the way I have noticed alot of symptoms and degrees of symptoms I have actually felt and experienced for a very very long time, said symptoms fit me more than an autism diagnosis does. I stumbled across ""Quiet BPD"" and honestly this really does fit almost everything to an absolute T in what I've experienced all my life.

To add onto this after me finally letting some of my feelings out on topic of these conversations she said to me she thought from the very first few days we met that she suspected I have BPD &amp; the more deeply we talk on things she recognizes it more and more.

I am stumped as to what to do. Do I try to get re-diagnosed? Can you have both ASD &amp; BPD? Or should I just leave it and continue on?

Sorry for the long post I've been really thinking on this for about a week now and I feel this is composed right enough to post.",bpd_disorder

"I‚Äôm not sure if I even want to do this, but I‚Äôm curious to know what other borderlines think.

Me and my FP are very close, they are a quiet borderline while my BPD manifests much more externally. I‚Äôve made great progress on managing my attachments, and they‚Äôve made great progress on maintaining boundaries with loved ones, which is something they‚Äôve struggled with a lot.

Both of us are very open and clear about how BPD tends to make us think, and ways we can ease each other (e.g., clarifying our tone over text, occasional reassurance that our feelings towards each other hasn‚Äôt changed). However, i‚Äôve talked in a lot more detail about my- namely, negative- experiences having FPs.

They sometimes think that I might get bored by them, or I don‚Äôt want to spend as much time with them as I do, and some of me thinks telling them they are my FP might quell those fears. I‚Äôm equally worried it will put too much pressure on them that they don‚Äôt need, and regularly reassuring them that I love them is enough.

"How do I know which kind of personality disorder I have?
I want to work on it but nobody says nothing about it.

My last psychiatrist prescribed me a lot of meds, like 4 lines in my the report are only the meds. I'm diagnosed with generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, depression and ADHD.

He always would say something like ""a lot of the symptoms might be caused by yourself""

He believed I have a personality disorder but never spoke of it.

Recently (4 months ago) i changed psychiatrist since the last one didn't wanted me to keep coming, and literally tried to taunt me two times, even with my mother there, so I searched for another psychiatrist, and this one would look at my current prescription, and made the face of Wtf, Nowadays I don't have the same problems I had months ago, that's why I don't like going to the psychologist, since the problems I have today, might not exist tomorrow due to medication.

"I am still undiagnosed. It is not safe for me to pursue a diagnosis right now, so I have to wait until I move away from my mom.

My issue is that I have been question before on why I may act the way I do at times, and it‚Äôs very hard to describe it vaguely or by just listing symptoms, because I‚Äôm not ever taken seriously or people ask me why I have those symptoms.

I‚Äôve done CBT for years in the past but my trauma makes it really unhelpful. I had a 4 day ‚Äúcrash course‚Äù on DBT during my last psych ward stay in August and it looks promising for me.

I (25M) have a girlfriend (22F) who I am very serious with, we are talking about marriage. I've done a fair bit of research on BPD making sure I'm aware of what she struggles with and can react in positive ways to her feelings.

I'm wondering how I can best help her during/after her ""episodes of emotional inconsistency"" (what she calls it), usually lasts 2-3 days and she doesn't want to talk to me much but she usually apologizes afterwards for her distance. I tell her she doesn't need to apologize and I don't blame her. She communicates very well when these moods come up.

He says it‚Äôs because he gets bored at home which I‚Äôm sure is true but I think he feels pressure to make money to counteract the ridiculous amount that I spend on weed and food which makes sense as well.

"Hey everyone, 


As a self proclaimed stoner with BPD, I just wanted to ask what is everyone‚Äôs experiences with cannabis and their journey with BPD. 

I see alc*h*l and SH is commonly what I see others celebrating sobriety from (congratulations to everyone by the way! Proud of you!), so I wanted to ask where everyone stands on weed, because I personally have not seen much mention of it. 

Personally, weed chills me the fuck out. It really is a time that I can focus on myself and not have to worry about anything else.

How is everyone else‚Äôs experience using weed as someone with BPD?",bpd_disorder
"I got blocked by my FP 6 months ago. Even though I'm ashamed of myself, I'm honestly glad that they got me out of their life. But every single day since then, I haven't let myself forget about what happened. Who was in the right. Who was in the wrong. I just can't let go of this speculation. I really can't. Any other person would've been over it by now. I just can't do it. One moment I'm burning with resentment that this person wronged me and I deserve better, and the next moment, I feel like it's all my fault I made them feel bad and I'm a monster. I really want to get done with this. I did make some mistakes and I wish I could apologise and make amends  to the person, but I can't and it kills me. I try to find comfort in the fact that maybe now they're better off living without me. But the shame, and remorse that comes with it just overwhelms me. Overanalyzing old conversations, overthinking about something that ended months ago and I just can't seem to be at peace with myself anymore.

"BPD as a mask?

Does anybody else here consider that they are using BPD diagnosis to mask that they also exhibit traits of NPD and ASPD? Meaning you recognize other noteworthy traits and behaviors in yourself but think you‚Äôll gain more sympathy for BPD and being just unstable or have a rough childhood but aren‚Äôt necessarily dangerous or exploitive like the other two PDs.

I have had anxiety and depression (and bpd) for as long as I can remember but I can handle the symptoms of depression and anxiety pretty well now. But BPD messes with my logic so much. I can bd happy in a relationship but my brain will try to find a reason to reach out to a toxic ex or even worse I'll feel the need to end things with my partner because of a false narrative my mind makes up about other people.  Like how can I be in a 'healthy' relationship if 50% of the time I have to remind myself to not act on my urge to end things even though the emotions and logic behind ending a otherwise healthy relationship seems like the right answer. It is so challenging having to keep pushing forward when you don't know what way is up or down.,bpd_disorder

I don't even know what to think... I knew it was likely that I had it, but it feels like I've just been sentenced to a life of being considered ""unstable"" and ""too much"". But equally the fact that they never used the term BPD makes me feel like an imposter in BPD spaces like here.

My fiance says this to me, always with the emphasis on the word ""you"" and doesn't see the difference in meaning. I have tried explaining how it sounds and even shied him the difference in their sound multiple times,  but he still doesn't get it.

As a whole, he largely doesn't see how important tone is just as important as the weird themselves, except for if he is on the receiving end of it. If I'm irritated or upset, etc and I say something with a little too much ""stank"" on it, he will pick right up on it and say something about it being rude, mean, etc of me to talk him like that. 

Does anyone have any insight? I'm at a loss on how to respond to this awfuling emphasis he uses. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's me hearing things that aren't there,  like he has told me before, and maybe I need to see how kind he is being in that moment, but I honestly doubt it.

"Hi ! So I wanted to find somewhere to talk to people who‚Äôve got a diagnosis of bpd/eupd for some insight advice or whatever. 
Looonnngggg story short I was recently diagnosed with bpd (I had been diagnosed previously when I was 18 by a different doctor and also diagnosed with bipolar disorder) and I‚Äôm totally lost. The diagnosis of bpd is not something I understand and I‚Äôve been dealing with my life like I‚Äôve got bipolar and that‚Äôs it. 

And so with this diagnosis of bpd (when I was diagnosed at 18 they didn‚Äôt actually tell me, it was just on my records without me actually being told) I‚Äôm feeling totally lost and confused. What does this mean? There‚Äôs sooooo much info out there about bpd and I just don‚Äôt know where to start. I have a fair few symptoms but I also don‚Äôt have some of the key symptoms, from what I‚Äôve read. 

I‚Äôm in quite a difficult and low episode and I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has any reassurance or advice on research or even what causes bpd (I‚Äôve read different things about that too)

My mother in law hasn't really liked me much. We have a lot of history and she has never really talked to me much. 

First off, my in laws have Covid and did not inform us that any one was sick prior to us coming. So now I am exposed beacuse they are inconsiderate. 

Anyways, my mother in law was in the kitchen and I went to grab something so I was trying to talk with her. I asked her how my father in law was doing (cause he has Covid and quarantining in his room). She legit just walked away from me. 

Day two, went I legit lost it. My son was feeling like he has a UTI. I went to ask my mother in law for some pain meds to help. She didn't say boo to me ask she got up and walked to grab some out of the kitchen. Then she got into a conversation with one of my sister in laws about olive oil while just standing there holding the damn bottle. I just grabbed it from her. She didn't say anything to me. 
 
Come to find, the medicine expired in 2012. So I'm pissed. I was out of the house flipping to bird with both hands I'm the air to grab my kid stuff that actually gonna help him. 

I talked with my husband and he wasn't ok with his mom's interactions with me. So he told her my feelings are hurt. She said ""I am very busy and all over the place. I don't have time to talk to everyone. Sorry if I offended you"" and walked away. She sounded irritated.

So I am seeing red at this point and go in the house to grab my stuff and go. My husband has a large family and they are all eating dinner. Infront of everyone she tries to hug me. I am so emotional disregulated I put my hands up and said "" No, please dont. I am having a moment, and I am leaving."" Then left. None of his family checked in on me expect one sister. 

All of mys sister in laws I thought I was close with haven't reached out. Now I feel abandoned. I can't help but feel like I am broken and everyone hates me and thinks I'm crazy.

Is it demonizing another person simply because they don't react the way you expect? I.e. no validation in extreme emotions, reacting angrily, ignoring, or anything other than validation and patience?

Could demonizing be coming up with mental illnesses for the other person's lack of validation to bpd person's emotions?

Or creating dramatic scenarios for that person to basically fall in to like a trap so bpd person can point the finger and say they're the bad guy?

Are triggers usually someone's tone or lack of validation in crazy making behavior from bpd person?

I feel like I‚Äôm creative and I sort of know my sense of humor‚Ä¶ but it is super easy for me to just wish to be and try to be similar in every way to my fp. 

Like I respect his opinions too much I think and tend to adopt them. I‚Äôll look to him as a standard for what sense of humor, taste in fashion and music, creative process, general life values and opinions and morals etc are cool/okay/good/right. 

Some of this makes sense as I do think he‚Äôs knowledgeable and well-adjusted/healthy/raised well (he‚Äôs had the most perfect upbringing I‚Äôve probably ever heard of lol) etc but I feel often like this little kid that looks up to and follows him way too much.
I‚Äôll literally feel a bit deflated when I show him something that I think is cool and he doesn‚Äôt seem to like it ‚Ä¶ 

And then it will make me reevaluate and rework all the sort of ‚Äúrules‚Äù I‚Äôve invented (without meaning to) about what one should do, what one should like, who one should be etc in order to be liked by him.

"Today my friend sent me a text. ""Hey I'm catching up with X (her friend) tomorrow and wanted to know the name of your GP cause I think she'll be a good fit for X""

I didn't really want to give out the name of my doctor because it's very personal for me. I struggle a lot with my mental health, and my doctor is always there for me, we've also had some ups and downs though and I'm also weaning of valium after being on it for years. 

I talk about my sessions with my doctor a lot to my friends, I also talk about the ups and downs of my friendships with my doctor and so I'd feel a bit weird if my friends also started seeing my doctor (if they found them of their own accord then that's different but I didn't feel comfortable giving the name of my doctor)

This is also my friend asking for her friend, I only know her friend more as an acquaintance but I do know that she's also extremely emotionally challenged and gets quite volatile at times, I don't necessarily think my doctor is a great fit for her, she also abuses valium and I got paranoid that if my doctor didn't give her valium, she might get angry and say how she prescribed it to me etc or something.

I'm probably being paranoid (part of my mental health issues) but it just made me feel uncomfortable. My doctor is gay (so am I) and so is the girl my friend is asking for so I assume that's why she was asking.

So what I did was Google other gay friendly medical centres and recommended one to her for her friend. I didn't explain on text why I didn't give her my doctor's details as I'd prefer to explain that next time and in person not on text. I didn't want to over explain things over text.

She didn't respond and it said she was on Facebook just before, so I feel like she must be annoyed that I didn't give her my doctor's name. I also sent a text shortly after asking if she had seen this new show on TV that I thought she'd like but she didn't respond. 

Is it bad that I didn't? Am I obliged to give out my doctor's name for a friend of a friend? I feel hurt that she didn't respond, part of me feels like texting ""is everything ok?""

What set me off to ask this question was something that happened today where she was getting more and more annoyed with everything going on (people on the road, waiting in line, cleaning etc), as a supportive boyfriend who is aware of this I try to calm her down and then the anger is pointed towards me. I am aware that when this happens, what she is saying and what is happening is not her, and it‚Äôs just a false side of her. It‚Äôs why I keep my patience with her.

Another time is when I say or do something stupid, say not clean something properly, or do something wrong, the same thing happens‚Ä¶an argument where nothing is resolved.

Sometime it ends with one or both of us crying bc it gets too intense.

Now of course it isn‚Äôt all her and let it be known I‚Äôm not trying to paint her as the bad guy, I have my own resilience, I am one of those corrector kind of guys, I always have to be right even if I‚Äôm not intending to. I‚Äôll say something or lash out if it‚Äôs getting bad and I know I should.

All I‚Äôm asking is for some advice on how to do deal with these situations, and how I can change my ways to help our relationship and grow. I just want to be the best for her.

"I've never posted in here. I don't know what this post is even about as such. Had my diagnosis for about 10 years. Had 3 years of therapy that ended in November. Also came off my anti psychotics. And now on just anti depressants and meds for anxiety. I'm not sure about the terminology everyone uses (seen splitting alot, but not sure what it means). I guess this post is just like my thoughts and feelings I guess?I feel myself starting to spiral. Not to the point where I'm having thoughts of un-aliving or SH. Just how much easier it would be. I also can't be bothered to do anything. Not even necessarily productive. But ANYTHING. Cba to watch TV. Or go to sleep. Or watch you tube. Found myself endlessly scrolling on Reddit for a distraction. But also if I have to leave the house I actually enjoy it. If like my bf asks to take me out or what ever I genuinely look forward to it. And enjoy it when I'm out. But I also can't find the motivation to leave the house or do things off my own accord. 

When I explain things to people I also try and make it seem ""visual"" to them. There's time where I'm not sure if I'm overthinking etc so I say that's the BPD side of my brain... and there's a alot of things at the moment that I'm not sure if I'm thinking like that because of my BPD. 

I have a very good support network around me. But when I dont feel suicidal just in this weird place I don't exactly know what to say, or how to describe my feelings because I dont know myself. I don't know what's started the spiral so I can't fix it. So I just thought I would post here. Even if nobody reads it, it kinda feels like I've got it off my chest the fact that I think I'm struggling but not sure.",bpd_disorder
"i have dreamed of going into the mental health field ever since i was young. i've been in mental hospitals as a minor (ages 14 and 17) and had some pretty awful mental health ""professionals"" in my corner who truthfully only made my mental health worse. ever since my first hospitalization, i've known that i want to work in an inpatient setting so that i can offer help to patients in a way that my own professional team could not provide back then. i'm currently in school for social work, and am planning on going for my master's so that i can work in a hospital.

today, my mom was very angry (she has covid and has been taking her frustrations out on me) and told me that i would never be a good mental health social worker because people with BPD aren't fit for those types of jobs. i know that i should just ignore her, but she's never said something like this before and it really made me think. can people with BPD be successful in mental health positions? does anyone have any personal stories of working in this type of field and doing well? i just think it will help me feel more confident in my career choice if i had some reassurance that there are others like me who have become successful mental health professionals because sometimes it is hard for me not to hyperfocus on comments like this and let myself give up on things as a result.",bpd_disorder
"I‚Äôve been diagnosed with bpd for about 2-3 years now, but I‚Äôve never consciously had a fp. My therapist didn‚Äôt explain this to me at all, and I can‚Äôt quite comprehend what I read online except that a borderliner is usually dependent on this person. 

I‚Äôm not dependent on my girlfriend for happiness at all, nor do I constantly worry she‚Äôs going to leave me like I read online. 

However, we‚Äôve been apart for about a week now due to the holidays and family stuff (our families celebrate on the same days so we cant be together) and I‚Äôm unreasonably miserable. I‚Äôm depressed, I can‚Äôt sleep, I think about her non-stop. That says something, for I‚Äôm also ADHD-autistic and not even my hyperfixations or special interests seem to invoke such emotion in me.

"Hi fellow BPD people, hope you are all well.

This is my first post here.

I have been diagnosed with BPD since 2016 and have been medicated with quetiapine (serroquel) which is an anti psychotic/mood stabiliser since my diagnosis which has been a miracle medication for me.

However my fianc√© (been together almost 7 years) has said that at times I can come across as cold, non compassionate and not genuine at times - this never used to be an issue, but recently it has become an issue.

The scenarios for coming across that way are when I am apologising, checking on him when his back hurts, when trying to console him etc.

It's super frustrating cause in my head I know I am being genuine but it's almost as though I have lost the ability to portray my genuine emotions to him?

Before being medicated I would cry from happiness etc, but now I barely cry at all whether something is fantastic or terrible.

This is a very big jumble of words and if you have made it this far thanks for reading I hope someone can understand what I am trying to say cause I sure am struggling to put it into words.",bpd_disorder

We've had a very confusing and turbulent relationship over the years we've been friends and although my feelings for him never changed, everything was fine.. Until he moved in with me 6 months ago. 

We live in this weird ""friends/relationship"" scenario in my head. We have seperate rooms and we're purely platonic but we share a home no different to any of my past relationships so it's easy for me to fall into that bubble. 

Recently he expressed a need to meet new people online, mainly texting friends and stuff to break up his day, which I get and understand.. But he met a few girls and has been staying up all night texting/phone calling this girl. To the point he doesn't even try to make it not obvious. When we're gaming with friends, he always getting us killed or landing last so he's miles away from us, running into walls or the worst one for me, just ignoring me when I talk.

"i want real answers on this all opinions and no hate pls

i think this whole trend of setting boundaries has started to go too far. i truly feel that people are starting to put up full on concrete walls around themselves so that they don't get hurt.

respectfully, we are all learning to respect ourselves more and love ourselves more.. but with that movement came the ideology of ""i don't have time for people cause i have to focus on me"" and i think that is flat out S E L F I S H 

yes i said it. your boundaries are starting to become selfish. i don't think we should close ourselves off other people because we don't want to get hurt or hear something we don't want to hear and accidentally get triggered.. LIFE is life. people are going to hurt us.. but it's not about STOPPING people from affecting you.. it's about YOU learning how to NOT let something affect you.

for example. WHAT is trauma dumping?? that's the most selfish sh*t i have ever heard.
don't get me wrong, i understand not being in the right headspace to deal with someone else's problems. but at the same time i think that's selfish too. 

not to say that everyone needs to have people pleaser energy.. but at least care enough to listen to someone who needs to talk to someone they might not have to talk to. therapy isn't accessible to everyone.


i guess what im trying to say it where is the love? i have personally always had the capacity to put my problems aside and be there for someone who is in need.. but these days people are closing themselves off from having empathy and only caring about themselves and their precious feelings. 

i stand by what i say. to recap: i don't agree with ""trauma dumping"" being a negative thing (it shouldn't even be called that when it's really just venting?) if you can't be there for a friend that's truly selfish of you.
and overly setting boundaries outwardly towards other people is selfishly putting walls up around yourself so you don't get hurt.

"In light of seeing posts lately where we should be helping each other overcome our challenges with BPD, I wanted to start doing that by sharing some of my tips that has helped me get by. 

Today, I‚Äôm gonna start with a very simple tactic for Paranoia which I call mindful Ignorance. Mindful ignorance is best described as having a lack of information to keep your mindfulness at bay rather than stressing out. You may find that you focus on you and your journey to navigate BPD more so while practicing this (at least I did). 

The main cause of my paranoia is social media ‚Äî any post can stress me out and make me paranoid. If you have a tendency to doom-scroll, you get what I‚Äôm saying. 

So, something that has REALLY helped me is to delete all of my social media applications. I kept one account so I can keep up with my favorite brands and such, but none of my friends follow me. 

If you‚Äôre an avid Twitter user, make a Twitter list of some things that don‚Äôt make you stress you out. Keep it in handy when you‚Äôre feel a trigger coming on. 

For in-person situations, I have adopted the mantra of ‚Äúif it is not said to me, then I assume it is not about me.‚Äù Not every thought in your head is true, and you must remind yourself that. 

It gets easier as time goes by, you can return to these apps and such whenever you‚Äôre ready. 

We all can overcome this, I promise.",bpd_disorder

"So I want to start off by saying that my aunt DID NOT do anything wrong. I just get in my head and make myself feel bad.
For the past year or so I have had sim really bad stomach problems, like I physically get sick for no reason and we can‚Äôt find out why, also for the last 2.5-3 months I have been in one of the worst BPD lows I have ever been in.
I‚Äôm on vacation with my nana and my aunt and my aunt asked me about where I‚Äôm currently working and I told her that currently I‚Äôm not working due to my health. (I had been working at a local diner for about a month or so, this has been a bad year of working for me also, but I quit earlier this month.) But, I am also a full time student working towards my Bachelors degree (two semesters left!!), so after talking with my husband and everything, we decided that I could stay home and work on keeping the house clean and focus on school, at least for this upcoming semester.
Anyway, my aunt was asking about me working about part time and stuff, I just explained that I haven‚Äôt been in the right headspace/healthy enough to go to work and not get sick/have a panic attack or get in my head about something. 
I‚Äôm not mad at her for asking or anything, I just wish that I wouldn‚Äôt hear the excuse of ‚Äúwell I haven‚Äôt been either‚Äù when I say that I haven‚Äôt been in the right place mentally or physically.

"To preface this, I've been diagnosed with BPD for over three years. It's been a difficult journey. I'm not trying to perpetuate any of the stigma with any of what I'm about to say. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure we're all at least somewhat aware of the kind of posts or comments I'm referencing. Many of us struggle with romantic relationships and will post here about it. I just want to say this isn't meant to invalidate anyone's feelings or make anyone feel like a bad person, but with BPD, relationships really can bring out the worst in us. I've seen countless comments on threads where someone mentions struggles in their relationship instantly siding with the OP, disregarding any unhealthy behaviour on their part and calling their SO ""toxic, manipulative, gaslighting"" and calling on them to break up. 

WE DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE PEOPLE OR THE SITUATION BEYOND ONE PERSON'S SIDE. 

We can't give unbiased advice or opinions. We can't know the objective truth. And so many people here act like not respecting your partner's/friend's/whatever boundaries, exploding on them, yelling, being obsessive, stalking them, being controlling, etc. is normal because ""they're my FP"". IT IS NOT NORMAL, OR OKAY. I know it's not our fault and we can't always control it. I've been toxic in the past. I've been manipulative. It was a hard pill to swallow but I had to admit that to myself to be able to grow as a person. It wasn't my fault, I didn't choose to have BPD, I couldn't always control it. But I had to take responsibility for my actions and behaviour and admit to myself that it wasn't normal, or okay, or excusable by saying ""they're my FP, I have BPD, I can't help it"". 

We can't always help it, but enabling each other isn't going to help us further our recovery towards being a healthy, functional human being who can cope with their thoughts and behaviours. I realise that many aren't at that point where they're ready to make that step, but please for the love of God stop making every calling-out of unhealthy behaviour ""perpetuating the stigma"" and ""invalidating"". It might be an explanation but it isn't an excuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I want to close this by saying none of this is meant to be read in a way to make anyone feel bad about themselves or their behaviour. We all know how hard it is to live with BPD and how easy it is to spiral out of control, and how important it is that we forgive ourselves for making mistakes and realise they don't define us to be able to grow.",bpd_disorder
,bpd_disorder
"Just something I've been thinking about since most of the differences between the two disorders seem behavioural, rather than a fundamental difference in the overarching symptoms or causes. E.g. people with CPTSD show less impulsive and self-destructive behaviour and find it easier to function in relationships than those with BPD.But it's still common to have mood swing, psychotic symptoms, feeling of emptiness etc in both. 

Any thoughts or links to research would be greatly appreciated.",bpd_disorder
"I‚Äôve noticed that under pretty much every post that looks for support and advice, especially when it comes to relationships of any kind with other people, commenters are so quick to enable splitting behaviors. I don‚Äôt just mean supporting OPs or telling them their feelings are valid (they are!). But more and more comments I see are trying to pathologize and moralize other people‚Äôs friends and partners without the whole story. This seems especially out of place when the OP admits they are splitting; if we know someone else is splitting why would we try to get them to double down on it?

Obviously some of this is just par for the course when asking for advice from other folks with BPD. but i still feel like we have a responsibility to try to do no harm, and I notice more and more upvote-downvote wars over this kind of thing.

TLDR is there too much projecting and enabling of splitting in comments these days?",bpd_disorder
"I don't think anyone is ever going to actually love me. No one really knows me. I'm a fucking mess. And as soon as I fall apart people are confused and then they leave. Everyone is always like Oh you're so great, so sweet so nice. lol Inside I am this flaming ball of rage. 

But the funny thing is, the title was something my FP said. She would always tell me ""Oh you're such a good person. You have such a beautiful soul. You're beautiful inside and out."" And I would always tell her that I'm really not. I can be kind of awful and I'm a mess. And she would say no you're just really honest. ""You say things people are too afraid to say"" 

&amp;#x200B;

And the moment I fall apart\\ split \\ act out in anger, she's so fucking surprised. And now she hates me. which is weird because she has anger problems and mental health issues as well. I feel like she put me up on this pedestal and played with my emotions and then just discarded me when I became an actual human being. 

&amp;#x200B;

Same thing with a former friend of mine. I don't think he ever truly wanted to be my friend. he just wanted to sleep with me. He told me I was perfect so many times. And how wonderful I am. Again I tried to tell him otherwise but he wouldn't listen. That is so exhausting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's why I did what I did. I didn't want either of them in my life anymore because they made me feel things I didn't want to feel. I felt backed into a corner.. So I exploded rather than imploded and now I have no one. But that's what I wanted right? But now I'm so angry and it seems like I'm never going to get over this and I want them to hurt just as much as I'm hurting.

The annoyance I see on their faces burn. 
Are the negatives the only thing I bring? 
Daily thoughts like this make my stomach churn. 

Two versions of me swirling together
A sick joke, mocking my existence.
A cruel plan of destiny I have to weather
Hoping to be rewarded with for my slow persistence.

"So my stupid fucking dumb ass just accidentally deleted my boyfriend‚Äôs Messenger thread. Over 5 years worth of messages and photos, gone. Poof. Just like that. Because of my stupid fucking clumsy brain. 

It might sound super trivial but this has absolutely devastated me and I‚Äôm really spiralling. I feel like the last five years have disappeared and gone to waste, even though he still has all of the messages on his account.

We are currently long distance and I‚Äôm seeing him for the first time in over a month tomorrow and it can‚Äôt come fast enough. I‚Äôm so fucking stupid I cannot believe I did that, those messages were all I had to keep me going.",bpd_disorder
I came across [this fantastic article](https://www.thelastsymptom.com/post/copy-of-pet-allergies) that really hit home for me and might explain why some people with BPD say they‚Äôve never experienced trauma.

To be put in simple terms, i don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel helpless? I feel like i understand why people leave me so often.

I say sorry way too much. they tell me it‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs fine. i apologize some more and cry even tho i was just told it was okay.

I may talk to my mom about it if it‚Äôs bothering me too much.

Like this sounds good right? But it feels wrong. I feel like I am just hiding so much about what goes on in my day with everyone. It‚Äôs a huge part of everyday.

another part is sometimes i can‚Äôt tell if i should be genuinely upset or not. the only person i can talk to comfortably about it is my mom but her and my mind work pretty much the same so she‚Äôll always take my side.

"I am in a relationship and an ex-partner wants to sleep with me.  There is barely any sex in my relationship, but we live together and are very close emotionally.  I've also been very suicidal for a long time, partially due to health problems, and it feels like such a waste to be wanted but say no.  Simultaneously, the very debate makes me even more suicidal because it's so exhausting to have two subunits of my mind fight.  I want to self injure very badly because of this, and simultaneously want the relief from every day pains this would momentarily bring.  On top of that, my partner has expressed some openness to an open relationship, but is simultaneously a very jealous person.  I'm thinking about this while simultaneously overwhelmed about everything - finances, health problems, you name it.  It also feels like the small comforts in life keep me from killing myself, and keeping myself from killing myself is something I only really understand as a kindness to my family, because I want out.

"my best friend is finally done with me. i haven't felt this way since i was in high school when the same thing happened then. 

when i was like 16 i made a stupid joke to which my best friend at the time took insult, and we had a massive fight about it. she stopped talking to me and i was so fucking obsessed with getting her to stay that it basically just drove her further away.

im 20 now. my current (i guess not anymore) best friend and i had a fight like that one (dare i say even worse) which stemmed from me being impulsive and oversharing things i shouldn't have. she expressed concern about my mental health, i took insult to that, split on her, and stopped talking to her for a few days. she reached out, i yelled at her for no fucking reason and now she's stopped talking to me.

i can't shake the feeling that i'm regressing back into the person that i was as a child. i can't stop thinking about her and it's taking everything in me not to message, or call, or stalk every profile she has online. i feel like a fucking psychopath. i'm CONVINCED she's talking about me on reddit (i know her account, she doesn't know mine) on a throwaway and ive spent the whole fucking day looking for a post she could've written about me - saying how much she's sick of me, how much she hates me, etc.

the thing that fucking pisses me off is how she always goes on about her own emotional dysfunction (she has ADHD) but - despite KNOWING i have BPD, never seems to consider how i literally have the same thing, if not worse because it actually impacts my relationships. she knows i can't control my anger and we've fought before. for some reason, this time just feels like the last. i feel nauseated. i don't know what to do. i can't bring myself to apologise again (i already have) because i'm worried it will drive her further away like it did with my childhood friend. but i also feel like ignoring her is showing that i don't care about this and don't want her in my life anymore.

"I've actually known this one for a while but this came up recently in discussion:

So BPD is a COMBINATION of a naturally highly emotionally personality with a failure to learn coping mechanisms to manage them (especially during childhood/adolescence when most people learn those coping mechanisms).

There's actually a ton of super emotional people out there who *did* learn effective coping mechanisms as children. One example is people who do a shit ton of scrapbooking or make pinterest boards or those magazine-clipping vision boards. I feel like that kind of person often gets a bad rap and it's kind of something people associate with middle-aged housewives.

Here's the thing though.

They're using it to express their individuality and hold onto their sense of self. It's a coping mechanism. You could learn something from them.

My mood flip from manic to depressed happened amazingly in a 24 hour period. I met someone amazing and spent several hours on the phone with her laughing and smiling my face off last night.

Today I got my routine STD tests back, all clear! Except something out of the ordinary in the urinalysis. Apparently a potential cancer or kidney failure sign. I‚Äôve been having some ED issues lately but nothing that should be problematic there THAT bad.

So I have to go in for follow ups for that.

"2 weeks ago my bf of 5 months broke up with me, because he felt I was leaning on him too much emotionally and didn't have enough trust that he actually loved me/cared about me. 

Long story short, the relationship was super intense at first. It was an instant, almost soul connection. We spent like every day together for a month, he told me he loved me after 3 weeks, etc. I can't remember the moment things started going south, but I started to get more insecure in the relationship. We would have a great night together, then I'd wake up the next morning and feel irritable/anxious, vent a lot, then feel like I was pushing him away by being ""too much"" (this has been a common thing in the past for me in relationships). He would always say it was fine, but then later he would be a bit withdrawn and would often say things like ""I'm just spent from our conversations earlier"" ""I'm drained"" etc. so it became harder for me to know when he was actually ""fine"" or when he was just saying that. As it progressed, I needed more reassurance from him - we would get in an argument (usually from me thinking things were wrong, him getting annoyed and withdrawing), then I would need a ton of reassurance that he wasn't breaking up with me. Conflict has always been really triggering for me, as I've had partners walk out at the first sign of conflict. He always said ""I'm here"" ""I'm here, you just need to believe it"", ""well figure it out, we'll make it work"", ""I love you"" 

Then, literally the day after one of these instances where he reassured me that hes not going anywhere, he broke up with me, said that we've tried everything, its just the same pattern, not working. 

I understand how emotionally draining constant reassurance can be and I've been trying my best to see it from his perspective. It just makes me worry about future relationships - if this guy was so ""in it"" but then just walked out, how am I ever going to believe someone else in the future? 

It's also upsetting because this relationship I was a lot better than ones in my past. I had a couple of slip ups, but I never did anything like accusing him of cheating, cheating myself, name calling, stonewalling, etc etc. If he couldn't even handle that, how is anyone going to?

"I need some relationship advice from people who understand how my brain works. So here I am‚Ä¶

Background: I was diagnosed with BPD (in May 2017) while I was in a long term relationship. That relationship ended in March 2020, and I‚Äôm still working to understand my BPD outside the context of a relationship and how to date with my brain working how it does. 

I work seasonally at a ski resort, this is my second winter working there. Last winter, I had a ‚Äúthing‚Äù with someone in a different department, and it was good fun but I knew I couldn‚Äôt commit how he wanted, so I ended things in the summer. Whether or not I was just running away from something nice, I don‚Äôt know. But that was the right move, and we‚Äôre still friends and coworkers. 

Well, I‚Äôm noticing I have this pattern of picking a coworker early in the season and becoming somewhat obsessive. All of a sudden they‚Äôre all I can think about and the only person I care about hanging out with or taking my lunch break at the same time as. This isn‚Äôt a pattern I found when I was still in therapy (for the months after my diagnosis) because my brain was so focused and obsessed with the relationship I was in at the time. 

So, a month into working, I‚Äôve found myself my ‚Äúobsession‚Äù - one of my coworkers who is very attractive, single (as far as I know), and definitely my type. I‚Äôm interested in starting something but I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm just following a pattern. I want a heathy relationship and I miss being in love. 

I guess the advice I want is whether or not I should try to make a move, or just try to fight this infatuation that seems to be a pattern. And if I should, how can I? He works in the same department with me and our shifts overlap 3 days a week.",bpd_disorder
"In a long string of complicated events, my boyfriend has lived with me and my family for the past year. The agreement between him and my mother was that he eventually would find another place to live as soon as he could. This is fine in concept, my household is extremely toxic and a big reason for my BPD, so it's a good thing that my boyfriend finds a place to escape the crazy. However now that that time has come, I feel like I'm going crazy over it.

I don't want him to leave. I would move with him but the place he's moving to is 45 minutes to an hour away depending on traffic, which would make my work commute hell. I used to have a 1hr 30min - 2+ hour commute awhile ago and I just don't want to go through that again. I'm also not in a place where I feel OK to move out, seeing as I don't think I could handle the situation it would cause with my parents (another long story, basically my mother has bpd as well and I'm her ""FP"", I can't do anything without her flipping out).

I feel like he's abandoning me even though we all agreed he would eventually find his own place. We're not breaking up but it feels like we are since I've become so accustomed to having him around all the time. It also feels like he's happy to not only get away from my family but from me as well.

The way I found out was also rough, too. I knew his friend needed a roommate and that it was quite possible he would end up moving, but he told me he'd let me know as soon as he found out.

Next thing I know, Christmas eve, haven't heard anything, and he tells my parents out of the blue ""Oh by the way I'll be moving out in the beginning of January"". I was so taken off guard and hurt that he hadn't even bothered to tell me beforehand.

I feel like he has secretly hated me this whole time and has kept it under wraps until now. Today and tomorrow are his days off. I have tomorrow off as well and we were supposed to spend the day together. Instead I get a text from him while at work that he's going in to work on his two days off. He *hates* working. And I don‚Äôt mean in the normal way, he has quit and lost so many jobs even in this year, it's his one big flaw. He isn't even staying with this job as it was a temp position! I can't help but feel like he's taking extra shifts to avoid me now.

I'm splitting on him and hard. I want to crawl into a hole and cry. But at the same time I feel ridiculous for feeling this way. I hate my BPD and wish I could just handle situations normally.

I'm sorry that this post is so long, and I know that it probably doesn't make a lot of sense, my life is really weird and complicated so it's hard to explain.

im trying radical acceptance and self soothe. there is always the thought that it was because of *me* that they left. i know that its not likely at all, but the worry comes in that maybe there is a fatal character flaw that i am unaware of, that drives people away.

"not that it's some sort of scandalous thing, I have intense CPTSD and ADHD and have suspected that I might have BPD for about 4 years  but the type where I just split on myself. 

after having a really rough breakup with another in April of this year ( they still check in on me and I fall for it because I still have compassion for her and depression both overtook us. She was able to do the same things I wante id with someone else but made feel preposterous for asking, it's complex but it's best that it's not romantic.), I took it upon myself to be really single and not rely on anyone because I was afraid of just being hurt again.So I just met people at parties and functions, trying to revive and resuscitate what little hope I had for new people. One night, I met this really sweet girl and her friend and she was very charming and funny and witty and She is frankly a firecracker but during the summer I was absolutely determined not to develop feelings for her and I came off a bit jokingly dismissive and said "" I'd be her secretary""  she is the exact opposite of my ex and is so relatable in the way she advertises healing and neurodivergencies and her struggles and  it's a breathe of fresh air.my good friend at the time noticed that and was like ""yeah uh-huh"" so essentially a couple months later I was at this party she invited me too and I became so wasted because I saw her in her outfit and i gaypanicked so hard I thought I was a freshman again. It was then I realized that I liked her but for some reason, like my brain is like don't??? Don't?? Like ?? Her? Don't hurt her?  I had asked her to a movie but due to health problems,I had to basically walk it back. Like I'll try to justify this and then we'll talk and then she'll say something that just makes me feel like I can be insane in her presence but due to my CPTSD I'm still so guarded. I don't feel like I'm on her level at all though, I'm way more introverted, I also just got back into therapy and I want to work on myself and she seems so nice. And also at that same party, I had this very weird sexual pull thing towards someone she may be good friends with and I feel like shame about that too. That friend and I don't talk at all though.

I guess all I'm asking is that are their things that I should keep in mind with someone who has BPD ? From basically the moment I met her, I think knowing her diagnosis hasn't turned me off from being her friend or anything, but it does make me want to be careful and not hurt her?",bpd_disorder
"I had the terrible combo of abusive household + bulling in  school combo for 18 years. I've been struggling all my life and felt like everything was rigged against me. I don't remember large portions of my child or teen years because of the intense disassociation.

Now I am trying to heal. I went to therapy but now I'm mostly on my own since I don't have enough money for more therapy. I realized that my fragile mind made me feel triggered in almost any aspect of my life. I was in a constant fight response with everyone. I was abusive myself in past relationships (friends, partner,...) Even though it was a trauma response, it was not a excuse. I am stuck with waves of shame that swallow me whole every time I remember anything I said.

I wasn't the best to my current partner some years ago, I said things I really regret. I apologized and he forgave me. I am trying as hard as I can to not fall into old ways and I want to think I am doing great. I talked to him and he agrees that I am way better now, but I know he resents me sometimes and I know that there is nothing I can do about it.

 Part of me feels like I deserve this resentment. I know I wasn't the best person, but I just want to have another chance. Every time I remember something or I see anything on media remotely similar to what I said, it's like I'm paralyzed with a bunch of stupid thoughts that usually scalate very quickly.

Told them about BPD and some things I go through; seemed pretty understanding but nothing changed. Haven‚Äôt spoken to anyone in weeks.

Some weeks ago, my friend (20F) confessed she liked me (20F) romantically. I liked her too. Before everything went down, we grew close and comfortable with each other. And it‚Äôs the first time someone has openly reciprocated their feelings towards me. It seemed like she wanted to start a romantic relationship with me because she told me she‚Äôd ‚Äúwait for me.‚Äù (I told her about how I wanted to work on getting better before going into any relationship, or at least learn to manage my friendships before anything else.) She told me I could tell her to stop waiting if I ever felt overwhelmed.

After our initial confessions, we kept close contact for like a week. We lived in the same city, but a lot of things happened to her at home so she left for awhile. I sent her messages asking her how she was, hoping she was doing well when she went days without responding to me. So, we hadn‚Äôt been in the same city in a while. We made plans prior to meet up and hang out, but with everything that happened, I understood it‚Äôd be awhile before we see each other again.

When she confessed, she told me she hoped she could be there for me when times were hard. So, I tried really hard to be open with her about good and bad things. But when we texted, it was pretty one-sided. I‚Äôd excitedly tell her about something, and she‚Äôd responding repeating what I said, essentially. She never spoke about herself when I asked about her, only giving vague answers. It started feeling like she was responding to me out of obligation, often times apologizing if her not responding ‚Äúmade me think‚Äù (her words). And it did, but in the end I always understood she was busy with many things so I didn‚Äôt feel any anger or thought about it too much, but her unwarranted apology did make me a bit irritated because it felt like she really was just responding to me out of obligation.

And recently (after like a month of not seeing her) she came back to the city we live in. She hasn‚Äôt told me directly that she came back, but we share each other‚Äôs location. It‚Äôs been a week, and I haven‚Äôt seen her. We‚Äôve texted once this week. I had a feeling she had a reason for not telling me, like maybe she wanted space after everything that happened at home. And I know she has her own priorities.

But last night, I saw that one of our other friends stayed over at her place, and this morning I saw that they went out together. I know she isn‚Äôt obligated to tell me anything, but still I think it would have been nice for her to at least tell me she was back.

Last night, I texted her she could stop ‚Äúwaiting for me.‚Äù I thought about this for awhile, but a part of me wanted to be hopeful, but I think seeing them together last night just pushed me over the edge. And we haven't revisited this conversation in a long time. Ultimately, I didn‚Äôt feel important to her, or at least as important as our other friends. I couldn‚Äôt understand why she didn‚Äôt at least tell me she was back.

I won‚Äôt deny I have faults in this. I should have communicated my feelings properly, but she once told me she liked me because she felt I didn‚Äôt expect anything from her like everyone else. I guess that always stopped me from saying anything because I didn't want her to feel pressured to act a certain way. But I always initiated everything‚Äîplans, heartfelt conversations‚Äîif she had just told me she was back, I would have reminded her about our plans to hang out.

Because of all of this, I doubt she has any feelings left for me. I don't think I'm important to her. I don't really know how to go on from here. I told her it would be great if we can still be friends, but I don't know how to even face her after all of this. 

tldr; had falling out with friend group. one friend (20F) confessed to me (20F), I liked them too. Talked for awhile, her responses became less infrequent due to family issues. I understood all of this, and was never angry with her or anything. We lived in the same city, but she left home to deal with family issues. She came back recently and didn't tell me, but hangs out with other friends despite our prior plans. Made me pretty annoyed, despite trying to understand. So I told her we can stop hoping for anything more than a friendship. Now questioning if she even liked me or if I was even important to her.",bpd_disorder

I not only hate my life, I hate living it. Everyone just feels to vapid and empty. 

I've given up on trying to meet people because how my self esteem is now rejection is just way to painful. 

I've been told for half my life now that it'll get better but it's got worse. And I'm only getting less confident, less mentally stable and more depressed and nothing helps.

Recently, I got back into contact with someone I used to date years ago. It‚Äôs going really well but I feel the weight of everything pulling me back. I know if I don‚Äôt have a stable enough life with friends, hobbies etc, it won‚Äôt be healthy with me and this guy. 

When I‚Äôm sad, I feel like I have no one to talk to any more and i can usually push the feeling down but right now it just really really fucking hurts and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

"TW??? He had a breakdown this morning and I wasn't sure what to do. He feels that I don't love him anymore because we don't have sex as often as we used to. For context: we both agreed sex AND love is very important, and we used to do it ALL the time when we first met 2 years ago. But nowadays, it is hard for me to be as turned on anymore and I think it might be me being stressed out with our kid, and all my energy going into taking care of her that I just..  don't feel like doing it as much.  Basically, he thinks its all his fault, that I don't love him, that I don't want him anymore. He also critizies the way he looks too, saying that's another reason why. But it's not. I tell him I love him I do want to be with him. It's not his fault and looks wise he's literally perfect to me. I told him too that just because we arent having sex all the time doesnt change the love i still feel for him, its mez its not his fault...

"I feel totally crushed. I rap and released this song that I thought was my best work so far (I‚Äôm still really new to music, started about a year ago) and I got some good feedback before I released it but then I release it and the first comment is so negative, but I feel like he‚Äôs right. I have a line in my song which I really regret now because it says ‚ÄúI got bars for days for weeks for months for years‚Äù which sounds super arrogant (even though most of my songs are usually the opposite and very self deprecating)‚Ä¶ 

anyways the guy comments ‚ÄúIf you have enough bars for years, stay behind them, I wasn't too impressed.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and I went from feeling good about myself to feeling like I‚Äôm totally empty and worthy of absolutely no shred of happiness. It doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôve spent the better part of a year believing I have NPD (despite my therapist and multiple psychiatrists disagreeing with me and saying it‚Äôs BPD). But I feel like such a narcissist for thinking my song was good, for having that arrogant line, and then for getting called out like that. I just feel exposed and thin and weak.

"So quick synopsis of my experience so far. i asked my gp to have a look at referring me to mental health specialists because of struggling with traits consistent with bpd. gp agreed very much not depression and needs a referral for diagnosis to bpd. received a letter saying i am too young to be diagnosed with bpd (i am 20F).

This brings us to today i am pregnant with my first child and my mental health has never been worse. i get referred to perinatal mental health specialists so i mention this bpd referral and the traits i‚Äôve struggled with for years. she says that while she can‚Äôt diagnose me herself her team can and it seems likely BUT she goes on to say bpd isnt called bpd in the uk its under the name emotional disregulation disorder etc.

i have never heard of this and truthfully it sounds a little bit like she is trying to fob me off. she says its exactly the same but that the term borderline personality disorder is american and not used in the uk. however the nhs literally have a page discussing it titled borderline personality disorder and at no point does it mention this change of title? 

has anyone heard of this? it doesnt even seem close to bpd especially as most of every mental illness has emotional disregulation",bpd_disorder
"I have been stressed and amped up, a lot going on. Finishing up my last semester for my associates. Also summer is always stressful because of my Section 8 renewal. I believe I mentioned this in a previous post.

This last month was my sister's birthday and my other sister had several soft ball games. I guess I don't well with being there for other people, particularly my family. I show up, it's done, I'm ready to go home. Any way lately I've been isolating because I've been feeling overwhelmed and resentful towards everyone in my life. A lot of that is just my own personal shit and I am aware of that. 

My mother and I had a conversation on the phone and I tried to explain how I've been feeling...'angry and mean' was the way I put it, and I needed to be left alone for a bit. She totally flipped it on me. Not in a bad way, but in one of those ways where I felt like I completely fucked up.

Why can't I just be angry? Or tired? Or just not be okay? 

Anyway, if anyone has anything they would like to say feel free to weigh in. Me personally I just feel like to be alone for a little bit. Let me do my own thing and not feel bad for it.

"I was in a 6 year relationship with someone and broke up with them a few months ago. At the beginning of our relationship I was 18 years old and my BPD was off the charts. I would get extremely jealous, anxious and all that lovely stuff almost every single day. It was exhausting. But the more that time went on we drifted apart and we were more like best friends by the end of it. When we broke up I hadn‚Äôt had any intense BPD jealous feelings etc for a long time and I genuinely thought I was past feeling that way. I was wrong.

Fast forward to now I am in a wonderful relationship. They tell me every day how much they love me and reassure me that everything is okay. They have BPD too. However the BPD thoughts have never been so intense. I have definitely never loved anyone this much and I hope I marry this person. I can‚Äôt go a single day without having the most gut wrenching anxiety that they‚Äôre going to leave me. I misread their tone of voice all the time and assume that they‚Äôre upset with me when they‚Äôre not. They text me little details of their day like ‚Äúoh I was just talking to a customer‚Äù and I‚Äôll genuinely sit and sob over it because I think they‚Äôre gonna fall in love with someone else. It‚Äôs hell.

And I am very aware that this is not normal and that it is toxic. I just cannot shake these awful thoughts and feelings away no matter how hard I try to. They couldn‚Äôt be more reassuring if they tried. How do I help manage this? Therapy is not an option for me at the moment unfortunately so I thought I‚Äôd reach out to see if you guys have any tips as I‚Äôm terrified of ruining this.",bpd_disorder

Because I calm down in physical holds? I never asked to have my head wrestled onto anyone‚Äôs chest.
Because I am a younger, passive woman? I don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs too many people outside my specific demographic they would‚Äôve felt this appropriate to say about/to.

I didn't even know this was going on until a mutual friend sent a screenshot of a very specific post that could only be directed towards me. Her and I were previously very close, and the last 2 months of our friendship were a bit stagnant as I became severely depressed, and was hospitalized for it for a week. She was one of the only people I felt like I could trust at the time, and I let her know multiple times that my mental health wasn't good and I apologized for not hanging out with her as much, etc. However, she became distant in return and I honestly kind of felt like she was developing a resentment towards me. I just dismissed it as a normal BPD overthinking thing, but I guess I was right. She claims I was a bad friend and that I blamed my mental health for it. I always try to take a step back and see the other side of things before getting riled up, but she is the ONLY friend who reacted to my depression in that way.

"None of this sounds good or feels good to write, but I've been thinking about how I've maybe always used people rather than having two way genuine relationships.

I feel like I have lacked awareness and understanding of the give and take of relationships. Basic empathy.

In relationships, I think I expected and wanted my partner to fill the void I feel, without really seeing them and appreciating them as a separate person. I expected them to be my everything and then broke down whenever they eventually failed to fill that roll.

With friendships, I never reached out to hang out. I only spent time with them if they asked and I felt in the mood. I was rarely that curious to how my friends thought about things or how they were doing. As soon as I got into a relationship, I'd drop all my friends because I felt like my needs were better met by my boyfriend. 

I have a new friend now who I enjoy spending time with, but we have several mismatches in values. They are my only friend so I'm excited about not having to be friendless anymore. It's nice to have someone to text and hang out with.

I feel lonely and resentful. I have the urge to do something really serious to make him care. Like write an ambiguous letter about where I've gone, or just leave without a note and sleep at a hostel for the night. It would give me some space as well to think things through properly, and I would be the one to leave, instead of being rejected in my own flat. It's much harder when he's there and asleep than when he's not there at all. 

I feel bad for not looking after him but if he's just sleeping I'm useless anyway. And my brain is like, ""How can he leave me alone when I'm struggling. He must not love me."" Although I know he's just ill. 

Any perspective is appreciated but please don't be mean to me. I'm struggling to think and I don't know what to do.",bpd_disorder
"I was very recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with BPD. I'm 24 years old and it went unnoticed for me for a very long time.

I am usually a jaded person and don't show emotions or let people in. 3 years ago I met an amazing group of people in college and we quickly became the best of friends. I really enjoyed their company, but my walls where so built up I was never able to let them in. Until last year, where for some reason I told myself that maybe letting people in isn't such a bad idea. 

So I started opening up more to my friends, and I quickly became attached. I developed attachment issues, it started feeling like my worth as a human being existed only as long as my friends showed me love and care. When they would be busy or not talk to me as much, I would start having panic attacks, it would feel like I was going to die.

To deal with that feeling I did a lot of messed up things being in denial and not thinking that maybe the problem was me and how I was feeling. I started having tantrums telling my friends they are bad people for not checking up on me, I started creating false situations where I or someone in my family was having a critical medical condition so I would make that horrible emptiness in me go away.

I lied, manipulated, gaslighted and hurt the people I loved the most. And they took it for a year, until they noticed that the lies who where very impulsive made no sense and that it's not normal for someone's family to have so many deaths in a short amount of time. So they cut me off for being a liar and it's what made me seek therapy.

I'm happy that I have a chance to be normal and the diagnosis makes me a bit relieved because it means I'm not completely hopeless. But I feel so lonely and miss my friends so much. I never imagined I was hurting them, I just needed them and it was easier to lie than admit that there was a problem.",bpd_disorder
"It's a long story but basically I feel like if I go home I'll cut my wrists open. I've been really suicidal for I think about two months but it just seems to be getting worse with every day that goes by. I'm lying on some grass now in a park. When you're this suicidal you really realise how limited other people are in their ability to help. They stop treating you like a human being or asking or inviting you to do anything normal, give platitudes or call the police. I've stayed in a ward before and I know it won't help. 

The only thing left is venting here but I don't know how to stop this feeling from getting worse and worse every day.",bpd_disorder
"I need help from others with BPD on how to go forward in this situation. Ive been in treatment for the past three years, but currently dont recieve any therapy for my diagnosis since i cant afford to. I really need, and would appreciate, someone with experience to help me since i cant get any advice from my therapist right now.

Today i had a heated discussion with my sister and her boyfriend. This is the first time Ive ever disagreed so much with someone in a discussion and actually not ended up raging and crying at them. I was feeling ALL the feelings. But kept my cool and in my opinion was really good at not escalating. I had some slip ups but took back what I said immediately, rephrased and apologized. 

It ended up being cool but now I‚Äôm sitting alone in my room completely BURSTING with anger. All of the things they said replay in my mind over and over. All of the things I wanted to scream at them is going off in my head like a loud ass, never ending firealarm. I feel like I can‚Äôt mask it so I‚Äôll have to isolate until I‚Äôve calmed down or something. Please help.

Right now I‚Äôm feeling really offended by the way it went down. Her bf cut me off several times and laughed at some of my arguments. These are both huge triggers for me. But I kept it inside. The themes discussed were transphobia and the patriarchy. I didn‚Äôt start the discussion, I just replied to a myth that was stated to correct it. I‚Äôm really sensitive about the subject as I have a lot of loved ones who are trans or identify outside of the binary. So it sits very close to my heart, which they know. 

The discussion wasn‚Äôt too long, but long enough to the point that I wanted to leave several times. I ended up not leaving because I didn‚Äôt want to escalate by being ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù. 

Now I‚Äôm sat in my room full of rage and feelings of inequality. At some point her bf asked me for literal SOURCES on my arguments. That pissed me of. He didn‚Äôt ask for them when my boyfriend was speaking.. 

In the end we all agreed to disagree and went on our ways. They seemed normal. I acted calm.

I‚Äôm kind of happy I didn‚Äôt rage at them. I don‚Äôt want to drive my sister away. At the same time I‚Äôm SO MAD I didn‚Äôt just rage?! It‚Äôs so contradicting and it‚Äôs driving me mad. On one hand I know I would have felt worse if I ended up screaming and making my sister cry or something but at the same time I feel like it‚Äôs so unfair that I can‚Äôt do that because that‚Äôs how I feel! Why does he get to peck at me during the argument and I have to shut up about it? Why does it feel so unfair? 

And how the hell do I go forward? We live in the same house so I‚Äôll have to engage with them. I feel like I‚Äôm gonna burst. Please help! Do I talk to him or my sister privately? Do I set down boundaries? And what would those be? I‚Äôm so confused as to what is supposed to happen now. Like I said I‚Äôve never had such a heated discussion without it ending in screams and crying before. 

The only feelings I‚Äôm having now is anger and indignation. 

I‚Äôm open to any advice and please tell me if I‚Äôm being unfair here 

Wtf please help I don‚Äôt know what else to say",bpd_disorder
"Hi, hopefully this can stay here and not break any rules.

For context (28/f)i'm pretty open about my mental health, seems like the best way to fight ignorance. I have been diagnosed with eubpd, anxiety and depression a mixed bag which is hell sometimes but we move.

Part of my trauma is r*pe, the legal and justice system in the uk when it comes to sex crimes might as well not exist. 

Last saturday I joined a group facetime before a night out, my intention was to find out when they were leaving nothing more. When they, two men who i believed to be my friends, answered they were discussing Amber and Johnny. They weren't saying nice or intelligent things almost as if you can tell they didn't actually pay attention to the case/trial and were just regurgitating the info from the bot farms and cruel people online. I know (or thought) them very well true crime isn't their thing let alone a dv case about a celebrity across the world. 

They were saying mean things and brought up the topic of defecating on the bed; the topic of DV is a trigger because i had a shitty ex who did bad things to me, so i asked the following question: 

""what is it about someone who wanted to burn a woman to de*th and then r*pe her corpse that you're so aligned with, surely if you had to pick between that or someone shitting on a bed it's an easy choice"" 

Because we all were talking over each other i had to say it a few times before they heard me, once they did the guy who i have (had?) been friends with for 15 years said the following: 

""what? are you just mad they (being the met police/cps/clearly himself/the other person who laughed /everyone) didn't believe you"" a variation of this was repeated about 5/6 times (he used the words sad,mad and upset when repeating)

it was clear i was uncomfortable

i had stopped smiling, i stopped breathing and got really sweaty and while this was said the second friend on the FT was laughing, hard.

This triggered a hypersexual manic episode because of course one sentence can ruin me like this, anyway i've spent a year in therapy and think before i speak so i addressed it 6 days later. 

The friend who laughed is now trying to gaslight me and say he didn't laugh, this then changed to he did laugh but it wasn't at that (i was at home with a friend and she heard so i know i'm not making it up) 

The first person who said it has offered no apology whatsoever, ignored a voicenote, ignored my one phone call and i'm here because i'm confused about my feelings.

It's triggered flashbacks so i'm struggling to sleep cause i'm scared to close my eyes, there's no apology, no one can explain how or why this joke is funny, i'm being gaslight, i can feel myself becoming more actively suicidal (currently passive) because if my own friends don't believe me i don't know what to do - i'm not and have never lied about what happened to me.

i am not a liar and i'm worried about my behaviour now i tried to be calm and use my wise mind like my therapist said but i'm ready to hit the roof now, this isn't fair kind or acceptable and i can't process how anyone can be so flippant especially because these are people i have confided in.

any advice on how to deal with this?
am i being to sensitive?
was i wrong to educate them on victim blaming (let's be honest he only said it because i pointed out he was siding with a mad man who has murderous ideations) 

both of these men have daughters and i'm worried for them, ultimately my soul is crushed i'm heartbroken and my head is heavy he made the joke so quickly i'm sure he was sitting on it and thinking it for ages

can anyone help or at least offer an opinion 

thanks üíó",bpd_disorder

"half a year ago I ended a really unhealthy codependent relationship, where my ex was, I think a ‚Äùfavorite person‚Äù. My whole life was dependent on him, and I gave up everything to simply be with him. I even gave up my values I feel like. And now looking back at the relationship, I dont even know if it was even real love I ever felt. Just like 3 months after we broke up I met this other guy online..and we really connected, like in a very different way from my ex. It felt more natural, like we already knew eachother, like we have the same values and humour and goals and so forth‚Ä¶but I dont see him as a ‚Äùfavorite person‚Äù. My life is not dependent on him and even if I want him to always be there I dont feel like I ‚Äùneed him to be‚Äù, if that makes sense. Yet that also makes me doubt my feelings. I always believed love was more like my last relationship, so its kind of confusing. I feel I cant trust myself and what Im feeling. Its like im weirded out and uncomfortable by healthy relationships ?? And also this guy showing interest in me, giving me all these nice compliments.. I almost feel like he is the one idealizing me and not the other way around and that also makes me feel uncomforable in a way?? Like how can someone even be interested in me",bpd_disorder
"I want to go back to therapy. 

I want to be totally honest. After some self-reflection and being in denial about my diagnosis (I chalked up my symptoms to anxiety and depression, as well as the PTSD) and was comparing myself to extreme presentations of BPD. (I want to explain here so as to not trigger or make anyone feel demonized.) 

I was once friends with another pwBPD that wasn't in treatment, like I was, claiming, as I have, that the meds didn't work, they made me feel worse, made us zombies, etc, the general disillusionment when receiving treatment, I guess. I wasn't getting better but I was trying to be more open, but just like them, I was bitter and felt like I was just being placated and treated like a child. 

They did some extreme things, for example, defacing someone else's property when they felt like their FP was taking care of someone else. I understand what they felt, but it scared me. I didn't act out that way but I acted out in other ways... no judgment. 

But now, after examining myself. How I could empathize with the desire to hurt them back. I am no longer in denial but. I am afraid of myself and have been for years. Afraid of what I might do if something hurts me bad enough. Does anyone else share this fear?

And I'm afraid to open up to a therapist. I realize I've blamed others for years for my mental health. Not my family I'm with now, but I blamed my mother, my foster mother... and after a series of limerence issues, and feeling like I needed a backup plan after coming out to my husband, not wanting to be honest about who I was because I was afraid he'd abandon us because I heard him distinctly say things that led me to believe he wouldn't accept me... üòî

I'm not the victim here, I've struggled to keep my irritability in check and not seep how I feel about things into my family. I worry that I am a narcissist. I retreated from everyone emotionally... pushed them away, got to where all I wanted to do was smoke pot and stay home and treated everything else like an inconvenience and I'm extremely ashamed and feel so guilty about it all. And remorse. I wish I could go back in time and change it, despite knowing I can't change the past. 

I'm crumbling underneath the weight of it. I try to hold it together and do what I need to do, but when I'm alone, I spend the majority of my time trying to shut up the thoughts in my head. I forget to do things sometimes, like last night I went out into the kitchen to get my dog his food, and my husband asked me to grab him a towel because I had forgotten to replace it after doing laundry. I felt so shitty, that I had forgotten something so important so quickly. I used to be so frustrated that I'd snap at others. I've silenced myself and suppressed it all, lately, and now I'm in this place where all I feel is negative. When my husband touches me, all I can think about is how I have failed to support him in the past. 

I'm afraid I can't change. That I don't feel love. That i have no empathy. And I cannot stop it. I have tried so hard and it feels like nothing is working.

When insurance kicks in, I'm planning to not let myself give up on therapy. Starting out fresh, with a new therapist, everything on the table. My triggers, the rage when I was a teenager, I fought with my foster mom and was extremely defensive and so scared all the time I wouldn't be treated the same as the blood daughters, but I got over it over time...

I am terrified that my therapist will look at me and say I'm a hopeless case, even though I desperately want to make sure both that I heal and can have decent relationships, stop the splitting... I'm struggling to keep hope alive, but I'm struggling and say at least I'm fighting it. I have an amazing support system and worry so much about inflicting the unintentional narcissistic abuse I endured as a result of a narcissistic faith system. (I even made sure I got confirmation from five other ex-cult folks, who have had to go through the same process, but didn't have as many mental issues as I do, for perspective, because I know mine is not to be trusted.) 

I just hug my teddy bear and try to ride it out but also work in the mornings so as not to neglect my responsibilities. I struggle with driving and staying focused... and feeling like I'm just doing all this stuff for my family out of guilt and ill snap back into my old habits once I get overwhelmed again though i feel overwhelmed at everything. 

I journal. I haven't been meditating because it feels like even when I try to focus on that, my thoughts still pierce through: ""you're faking this, you're not really trying to recover, you're just trying not to be alone, you're a piece of shit user and that's all you'll ever be""... and I don't want that to be true, but... my memories... they assault me daily. 

I want to go through my memories with my therapist. But I'm scared. I'm terrified. I've told my brother about all this stuff but can't help feeling like he's trying to make me feel better. I know he wouldn't lie to me. But... I feel like I've made them walk on eggshells around me...

I dont want that for us... my brothers and I got separated and I just got them back a few years ago. My worries about everything caused me to be controlling, micromanaging... I've tried to be mindful of those triggers... and I'm working on it. But if anyone has some insight, some advice, anything. I've written these same worries, my memories, everything down in my journal when I can't get them to stop... 

Can anyone, please... just anything.",bpd_disorder
"Good morning everyone, I'll just jump straight in. 

I currently have diagnoses for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and ADHD. I do not suspect I have BPD, but I have and still do struggle with the ""favourite person"" symptom, for lack of a better term. 

I was wondering if there were any other disorders that featured a similar symptom, or if perhaps my current diagnoses could explain why I have this seemingly BPD unique struggle.

I understand that you're not mental health professionals, I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions for possible aspects I could start focusing on and taking note of for when I'm able to meet with my own mental health team again.

"maybe my diagnosis was wrong and I actually have narcissism. as a teenager i always wondered if i did. yesterday my bf implied i night after trying to explain how i feel most of the time. i told him most times i feel nothing, buy when i do feel things i feel everything and he told me, ‚Äúit seems like you feel intense all the time. maybe you‚Äôre a narcissist‚Äù. i think he‚Äôs right. i don‚Äôt want to generalize all people with npd but i really don‚Äôt want to be the same way. i don‚Äôt want to be an evil, manipulative person. i don‚Äôt want to continuously hurt my loved ones. i don‚Äôt want to be like my father or any of my other abusers. at the end of the day i‚Äôm the common denominator in all my toxic/abusive relationships so maybe i am the narcissist",bpd_disorder

"I know this is a place to vent and not for advice, but I don't know where to go. 
A friend of mine is diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (much like myself) and she went through some things a while back that are not making sense to her anymore. She's been really worked up about the situation, and I asked her if I can post about this to reddit in hopes of finding more informed and unbiased judgements. 
This is her description of what happened to her, I will try to clarify some parts that may be erratic and not make sense to you. 

""I was admitted to the hospital in December and the psychiatrists were not very nice to me, the female psych would scold me for forgetting to write a journal but I trusted them, they diagnosed me with BPD and once they told me that they are performing a shock therapy on me and I was like alright, they put things on my hand and asked me things which I don't remember cause I too much medicated, after leaving the hospital I went for a follow up once and it was my last follow up because they told my father everything that I told them, *it was just related to my family* it was nothing like revealing my plan to harm myself or others. I was crying and shaking my head for them to stop but they did not, I didn't understand things back then but yesterday I came to know after random discussion with my professor that it could be a lie-detecting test, I checked the pictures of lie detecting test on the internet and they seemed similar to the one they used on me""  

So for one, your therapist shouldn't be scolding you, that kinda defeats the entire purpose. The second issue I see here is to my understanding, shock therapy works by passing a mild current through your brain, so they attach the thingies to your scalp. I have never been through it, so I may be wrong. But they did it through her hands. Which, she was told later, could be a lie detector test. AND they revealed what she said during therapy to her parents, which wasn't related to suicide or self harm. 

Can they perform these procedures without full disclosure and consent from the patient?",bpd_disorder

"**Idiot**

I find it hard to understand  
How much of my mind is you

How I long for you, your reply  
It is really painful to wait

Though what hurts the most  
Is how much if your mind isn‚Äôt me

And to slowly realise  
How much of a fucking idiot I was

To fall for you, to believe your words  
To hold out hope, and rationalise

I never felt like this about anyone  
You never felt anything at all for me

I have no idea why I keep going back to thinking about you - every fucking night. It's getting tiresome now. I was the guy that hated social media because it paints an unrealistic picture of reality - and now I'm thrown into an absolute state of despair when I can see you are active on every conceivable channel, but ignore anything I send.

I don't like being like this. I don't know how to stop being like this, not really. Why, in the fuck, did I have to believe you. Nothing helps. All I do is numb the pain and hope the next push up, the next book, the next something, will drive you out of my mind.

I feel like I'm wearing a weighted vest, and the more weight I put on it, the more it hurts. I know I need to take it off - but I keep hoping it will become the most comfortable thing I've ever worn. I keep hoping that the next weight will make it all better, and be worth all the pain.

How much I invested in the idea of us. I can make the money back, but I can't take that time back. I can't erase those feelings. I really hate the kind of person I slowly became. I cannot believe I fell for it.

"Venting here because I don't really know what else to do with my time honestly. Over the years, I have gotten pretty functional and less and less focused on romantic relationships, Fps, really any ups and downs at all. Unfortunately this has massively added to my boredom and once in a blue moon, I feel bored enough to try again.

I started talking to a new person online who knows a ton of my friends and we quickly started talking every day. They're a poet and super super cute and enables all my obsession etc. I made plans to go see them in the city where they live at the end of the month and they agreed, and obviously I've been excited for days and just feeling so inspired and so fuzzy. Probably due to my complete lack of allowing any of this sort of energy into my life in general. I even used it as a tool to get sober, wanting to be sober when I get there.

You already know where this is going. Suddenly canceling, even with this many weeks in advance, and I feel like someone shot me. I can't stop crying and dissociating. Maybe they were just enabling me to see how far it could go, I don't know.

"I feel a bit invalidated with my condition here because I don't have any clear idea of what might've caused me to have bpd symptoms. I've never been physically or sexually abused, and I don't think I've necessarily been emotionally abused either. I do feel like my parents were neglecting my social needs, however: I didn't have any friends as a child and never went out with anyone. My parents didn't seem to care / notice that I was always alone and never had friends over. I also feel like my parents were rather heavily drinking and our weekends would be spent at home with me watching them drink and sometimes argue with each other.

I'd also been bullied starting from first grade. I was bullied for being overweight and just having rather unfortunate looks. I was always isolated by everyone at school, literally no one wanted to hang out with me, so I was left alone and rarely spoke to anyone at school. This went on for the whole time I was at school, which is nine years I think.

I remember trying to kill myself at the age of 11. Then again at the age of 13 when I'd also start harming myself and drinking alcohol.

My house is... A giant unfinished asshole junior high art project and idk what I even bother. I went on this rampage and rave about redoing the flat and painting everything... Nope, not only did I not finish painting the bathroom, my living room looks like I'm insane with all the swatches. There's hobby crap EVERYWHERE and for me to even THINK that I could decorate the walls without my constant ""oh that would be cool"" ""oh no wait i like that better"".

I went on this mental run of maybe I have ADHD PLUS BPD for a whole day and you know what I learned??? NOTHING. I can't diagnose myself! But I also can't afford a doctor! Then I moved onto okay I really gotta find a gym, I'm so fat and ugly I gotta do something about it.

I can't PICK a gym though because I need to do classes, no wait I need a trainer, no WAIT i don't like that gym because there are only super thin white women in the brochures...

ONLINE SHOPPING! Gotta find a present... But man that would be cute, I can make it into a mural if I put it up and if I buy this... No I can't buy that I don't have the money... Add to cart... 

I'll never buy it. i promise you I WON'T because I have this big anxiety with not spending a cent on myself without permission (in a way, it's good). Even if someone hands me $50 and tells me to just GO FOR IT, I'll panic and just fiddle around and never spend it. I LITERALLY HAVE A GOVERNMENT CHECK I HAVENT BOTHERED PUTTING INTO MY ACCOUNT.

A month ago we were damn near homeless and this is who I am.

Help me, God.

I'm not even gonna talk about the laborious task of me attempting to make dinner. 

I'm so tired and I haven't even done anything but mental cartwheels.

"Hey y‚Äôall; can‚Äôt sleep, originally it was because of something else but now it‚Äôs because of‚Ä¶well, the title.
Long story short: Said favorite person - let‚Äôs call them XYZ - didn‚Äôt confront me about a breakdown I had over a fear of losing them (platonically, mind you) last april because they got a boyfriend and thought i‚Äôd be abandoned or forgotten. Gonna be honest, not my proudest moment. I still cringe thinking about that pre-diagnosed breakdown, and it didn‚Äôt help that that was when things got worse and felt like I was on eggshells because of it and being afraid to lose them over it.
But at the time, They acted like it was fine, and so I assumed things were fine right? That was until this march when they confronted me about my behavior, how clingy and draining I am, etc.
They waited eleven months to tell me this. AND on the week that I got officially diagnosed, which hurt even more; I shouldn‚Äôt let it hurt because they were right. 
I have them blocked and muted for my mental health; didn‚Äôt want to do it, but it got to the point where I had to hold myself back and use my techniques i‚Äôve learnt to not lash out. At times I feel like I‚Äôm at peace, but then other times I break down and start hating myself for not catching things on sooner to save the friendship, and then to hating them for not doing this sooner. I switch between missing them and hating them, and it got to the point where last quarter on campus every time I saw them I just‚Ä¶got this urge to run away and hide. Like seeing them immediately activated my fight or flight. Not in a ‚Äòah jeez here comes this guy‚Äô way, in a ‚Äòthey can‚Äôt see me if they do things will become WORSE and i‚Äôll lose control or break down or they‚Äôll laugh at me or‚Äô way.
Do y‚Äôall get any thoughts about losing loved ones from BPD, diagnosed or undiagnosed at the time? Is there any way to help move on? It‚Äôs not like I think about them every day, but it‚Äôs moreso like any thought of the event or if them comes in and I immediately want to block it out of my head. It won‚Äôt help they‚Äôre sharing a course with me next quarter once i‚Äôm on campus; I‚Äôm just gonna be mature and act like they‚Äôre only another student like I am, but I know internally I‚Äôm gonna act up and have to hold back.",bpd_disorder

"Background: we have been friends for over 10 years and began a romantic relationship 6 months ago. We live 2 hrs apart and until recently have been making the long distance work, with equal travel to see each other on weekends and holidays. In the last couple months, I have been the one to travel to see him, he ignores my phone calls and texts, and says that his emotional impermanence (when I'm not around, he doesn't believe I love him...? I think...?) and anxiety around making plans. 

I want to find a way to make this work but I'm struggling. I have done loads of research into supporting someone with BPD. But I suffered a significant bereavement recently and am in uni. I normally have empathy and patience coming out of my ears but I'm burning out. I wrote him this letter to start a conversation about this. How does it sound? Is it fair? Am I being reasonable? Any feedback would be amazing. Thank you. 

‚Äî‚Äî

As you shared with me last week, I am finding that our relationship is taking a serious toll on my mental health. I find it really hard to cope with the inconsistent communication, the lack of commitment to plans, and the fear that I cannot talk freely about my thoughts and feelings without causing you emotional distress that leads to a switch or a dissociative episode. I love you very much but I am not receiving the type of love I need in return. I need to feel as though my partner wants to speak with me, isn't stressed out about making plans with me, and that I am a priority in their life. Further, I need to feel as though I can support my partner through their own struggles, rather than burden them and burn myself out in the process. With things as they currently stand, I am not in a place where I can do this for you. I want you to trust me to help you through your hardships as I want to trust that you'll continue to help me through mine. I love you and I will never, ever abandon you. I don't know what I can do to help you remember this when you're feeling down. I understand and accept that BPD cannot be cured and that it makes all of this stuff incredibly difficult. But managing the symptoms it is by no means impossible. You are a strong, capable, amazing person and I *know* that you can do anything. You have been such an incredible, caring, and supportive person in my life. You always know make me laugh, even on my darkest days. If we could develop a way to move forward together, baggage and all, I would be delighted to continue our romantic involvement. I can imagine such a bright and loving future for us together. To get there, I believe that we must both agree to develop strategies to do this individually and as a team. But I need you to communicate with me and help me figure this out. I do not have the resiliency to do this alone. If this is not possible, then we should end our romantic relationship and return to being friends.",bpd_disorder

"Is it normal to lose the ability to feel emotions in your body?

Before i used to have really strong and intense physical responses to my emotions, and i would Feel them deeply. 

Now i dont Feel anything in my body. Not even the warmth of contentment and relaxation. Only stuck in nothing. 

This has happened over the last few weeks! 

I can cry, but I dont feel any emotion in my body when I do. My chest does not tighten and I cant feel the sadness and despair like that. My chest just feels empty and hollow. I try to feel, but it still just empty in my body.

I also dont feel touch like before, I am not numb, but I dont get tingles or good feelings in my body with touch or hugs. I dont get warm feelings in my chest and stomach. Still just empty. 

I feel like there is no connection at all between my brain and body, so the body does not generate an emotional response.

Sometimes I can feel sad/despair in my brain/mind if that makes sense, but then I cant feel any emotions in my body at all. Like the emotion happens outside, but not inside. 

I can react in an angry manner with voice changes and body language, but on the insade i still cannot Feel that surge of rage.

Anyone else dont feel any emotions in their body? Can this get better?

I cant really Feel my body. It feels like air and like i am not in it! It is so strange. If i dont touch it its like it is not there. And i cant Feel anything in my body.

It is so strange. Maybe i have emotions. I cry but inside is empty. I cant Feel my body. I cant Feel the crying.

My body feels distant, numb and detached.

When i lay down i dont Feel my body, like i am not in it. It does not respond and it Feels cold and dead.

Like i am only in my eyes.

Is this even possible? To Feel nothing in the body? I cry and Feel despair, but inside it is completely empty. Like no reaction. I cant Feel it.",bpd_disorder
"Sorry for the book, I just dont have anyone to share this with and im dying too. Lol. I've never had one before. On a whim when I was feeling really hopeless and sad about life I decided to treat myself and get a reading. I know there are lots of fakes and scams and I had a bit if skepticism going in. I know a lot of it can be generalized to the majority of people, but i do think there are things we cant explain and the way she did the reading felt authentic. She had lots of good reviews online,  and seemed to be legit. I dont have an online presence aside from anonymously on Reddit and she didnt ask any questions. She just dove in and new all these things about who I am as a person without asking anything. 

Right of the bat she asked me if I had a dog. I've been thinking of getting a dog for a companion even before I moved and broke up with my ex. i discussed this as a positive of moving with my therapist last year. She said my angels are adamant that I should get a dog, and told me that even if I didn't get one, one would put one in my life unexpectedly anyways. 

Overall she told me I've been through a lot of shit and pain but it's all guided me to where I am today, and had purpose. Also that I've never really had a choice in what happened in my life. I've always had a feeling deep down that I'm just floating through life with no real choice in anything. I've told my ex this before.

I guess I have always had guides with me through my whole life helping keep me safe, and that doesnt happen to just anyone. I'm vibrating on a higher frequency that attracts craziness and bad people. How throughout my life i was always worried about everyone else and their needs but it was never returned to me. She spoke with my grandpa who had passed (not sure if it was really him) and he wanted to tell me to work on my own garden. Right now I'm like a tomato plant with the small green tomatoes,  but if I keep tending to my own garden and not others the tomatoes will grow into big juicy ones. I teared up a bit at this point because he did have a huge garden that I spent time in with him. 

I also have a spirit guide named Randolph who is a tall butler like man. And hes always been there as my spiritual ""butler"". Lol. She said to ask him for guidance when I'm feeling stuck.

She asked me if I paint, which I do but haven't for a long ass time. She said to get the biggest canvas I could find and work on it as I'm healing. She said she got goosebumps focusing on the finished peice that I would make. 

She gave me hope for my future. She said I am meant to help kids in some kind of psychological capacity and I'm destined to do something bigger than me. She said I'd meet someone new in the future and that he will love me unlike anything I've ever known before. They will understand me as a person and see me as an equal. She said she had the feeling I'm scared of having kids which I deeply am. She said this new guy will probably change my mind on that because I'll be seen as an equal.

I'm not sure if any if it's real but like I said, theres definitely things we cant explain in this world and she knew things no one would know about me since I'm very private in general. I just really needed this today. I just feel less alone, and like it was a good decision to break up with my ex, cut out toxic family members and take care of me. She told me to keep trusting my gut, and don't doubt myself becuase I'm safe. Basically all the shit you should hear from those who love you, but with BPD we dont get that luxury. I just wanted to share this here with all you lovely people,  because we dont always get the validation we need and I knew you'd understand why this felt good.",bpd_disorder
Lately I feel like my bpd is ruining everything. I had a baby almost six months ago and I feel like my meds just aren‚Äôt working anymore. I would try to get a new script or even seek therapy but I don‚Äôt have good health insurance. So here I am. I feel like no matter what I do or say it isn‚Äôt good enough or it ruins a good day when it comes to my boyfriend and I. If I say something with an attitude it blows up into a fight. Half the time I don‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôm doing it. If he asks what‚Äôs wrong and I tell him ‚Äònothing‚Äô before telling him the actual reason it turns into a fight about what I‚Äôm doing wrong instead of confronting about what is actually wrong. If I say how I‚Äôm feeling he will take it as me blaming him for why I‚Äôm feeling a certain way (which is not my intention at all.) idk maybe I‚Äôm just rambling and sound ridiculous but I feel like there‚Äôs just so many stupid things that I do that will eventually lead to him leaving me (that‚Äôs my fear at least). Ever since having our daughter my emotions have been all over the place. I‚Äôve started to have suicidal thoughts again.. and I feel super detached from reality. I‚Äôm just tired of feeling like everything I do or say isn‚Äôt the right thing and idk how to make it stop. I want to be better and not have my bpd be the cause of every fight. I just don‚Äôt know how to turn off my mind.,bpd_disorder
"I'm 26f and n therapy for more than two years now. I learned my diagnosis this January, honestly I was buffled because it never crossed my mind but everything makes sense now. My so of 7 years was the first I told and when I told him on April I wanted to share it with my friends he was a little hesitant, but so was I.

&amp;#x200B;

So on April I told them about the diagnosis and that I was uncomfortable at first with it, because I became conscious of my behavior and especially mirroring? people. I wanted to be honest with them that a lot of times I did that with the group and I wanted to change that. I just really wanted to be accepted like this,trying to be myself without me being their hype man or the echo.

Fast forward to present I don't know if they don't actually like me or it's just me overthinking stuff.

But If I don't send a text or basically tell on my own how am I ,no one is asking or texting me anymore. I haven't been invited to anything and even when we supposed to have a group vacation I was completely excluded from the decision talk. The most hurtful thing is that I told to (let's call her Ann) to text me if they decide when they'll video call, she naver did. So they did the vacation and I was with them 2 days out of 7 because I couldn't change my schedule since it was last minute. Right when I left they proceed calling me random times and asking me where I was when they knew I worked at this hour, I felt like they tried to catch me on a lie??? The next day I video called Jim put the phone on a table and left me there just to listen to them as they did whatever. That was it.

&amp;#x200B;

They seem all cheery and excited when I log in on a discord call and I feel like I made all those up. I haven't express any concern or feeling towards any of them. But I have seen Ann and Jim on action shitting the other 2 people and then 5 minutes later talking to them like nothing happened.

On the other hand I noticed that everytime we talk or hang around, 3 out of 5 in the group always talk about them self and seem bother when someone says anything else. It feels more like a group trying to monologue what they did in their day and one up who has it worse. They seems to grow bitter of the world everyday maybe they were like this and I didn't notice?

"

     I am a 20 yr old male recently diagnosed with BPD who is looking for advice on how to cope with this diagnosis. It feels like bpd in males is rare making the stigma feel heavy.
     Relationships have always been unstable and spending habits terrible. DBT is starting soon but it feels like there is no point when I'm already this far behind",bpd_disorder
I don‚Äôt think this is really related to bpd but I just really need some perspective on this. So 2 years ago when I was 17 I was admitted to the adult psych ward and a few days after meeting a couple of people there was this one 38 y.o man that was getting close to me. At first he kinda did some weird stuff like making me hug him and his friend and also hold his hand while walking around but that didn‚Äôt bother me that much. It got weirder when my roommate told me he would stand outside my room at night and he would also talk about how he wants to fuck me but again I really didn‚Äôt care. Then on my last day at the ward in front of everyone he groped me. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs considered sexual assault or not. I started crying and the nurses took me to a room to try and comfort me. The thing is I cried for like 10 mins but then that was it. I called my mom to tell her and she told me to never talk about this again or tell anyone which kind of hurt my feeling because I felt like she was blaming me. Anyways I brushed it off and I never thought about it again but then for the two years after that I kept having a reoccurring nightmare that crazy white men are chasing me and trying to kill me. Now here‚Äôs my question is this actually a valid reason to be traumatized because I think me being sad over this is just me being dramatic. people have gone through worse stuff this guy only groped me it wasn‚Äôt that bad. Also if it is sexual assault why is my brain making me think it was a normal thing and that I probably deserved that,bpd_disorder

"I recently met a wonderful woman with BPD. Hit it off great. She is amazing in every way. Very intelligent ( emotional and general), very open and communicated effectively, very beautiful, self aware, and our personalities compliment each other very well. 
Things progressed very fast, but never felt rushed. She was very easy to talk to. I sensed a little codependency, but never problematic. I offered reassurance when I noticed. She seemed to greatly appreciate it. We were both very infatuated with each other and she even confessed to taking for me. Everything was very comfortable feeling, so I reciprocated my feelings. Not something I would typically do this early in a relationship, but they were genuine. I truly felt like I saw her. Not symptoms of a disorder, not the things she said. Her, at her core. And I loved what I saw. 
The next day, I was discarded with a lengthy text. She mentioned my love confession being part of the reason. And that she was splitting, which is a term I hadn't heard until then. 
I've been reading on the subject, trying to make sense of the situation and have a very basic understanding now. But the whole situation is very confusing. I'm not sure I've ever been more confused.
Really, I'm just looking for some insight. I assume, I'm now on the bad side of her splitting. Is she likey to reach out? Should I try to reach out? If I am on the bad side of splitting, should I move on? Dating someone with BPD seems to have a completely different set of expectations than with people without. I truly believe I can handle the hardships that follow dating someone with BPD. But maybe I'm naive. I have no clue. I've never met someone who has ALL the characteristics I look for in a person.

It's 6.30am now, I have been crying and screaming all night. Last night he texted me that he is feeling lonely. Tried to drop by at my place. I tried to explain that dumping his emotions on me like that is making me suffer and that I don't have capacity to help him. He got angry. I called to explain and the conversation really degenerated. He said some things that are really haunting me now. Reminded me of the times I was abusive to him prior to the breakup.

He admitted to lying to me when he helped me out during an episode last week. When he said he was happy to be there and help me. He said he didn't feel I deserve help because I go through this kind of episodes all the time.

I hate feeling out of control. It sounds so much like excuses externally and it frustrates me, but it lot feels as though I am not controlling my own mouth. Being on meds makes it so, so much easier to keep those intrusive thoughts inside, where they belong...

This is my brain, its so frustrating that a broken piece of it can hold so much power. I end up internally screaming at myself to be logical, and now apparently verbally I'm also doing it.

In moments like this, it feels so natural to separate the 'person' speaking those words, as if they and I are two separate beings. But in the end, I know that isn't healthy. And I know that to the person I lashed out at, I am just me. He can understand as much as possible, but being attacked from a narcissistic rage is still going to hurt. And maybe knowing I feel like I cannot control my own words helps a little, but I cannot expect his empathy to block his pain.

I hate this. I'm so glad I just got my meds again and I can gain control once more.",bpd_disorder
"It‚Äôs as straightforward as that. After my favourite person broke up with me he dumped everything I did to him onto me. According to him I was manipulative, tested him constantly, put words in his mouth and ignored him countless times. I feel absolutely awful because I can‚Äôt even remember doing half of those things. I came from a really mentally abusive household and got BPD fairly early into the relationship. I have awful abandonment issues from past relationships and I‚Äôm very clingy. It caused me extreme anger outbursts and anxiety, to which I‚Äôd constantly ask if he liked someone else or that I‚Äôd question if he messaged someone before me or called someone before acknowledging me. He says I have no right to use my BPD or trauma as an excuse for this. I think I‚Äôm just abusive.",bpd_disorder
"I‚Äôve taken narcissist test, I don‚Äôt seam to be one at all, but I am always thinking of myself, how I think, how I feel, why do I yell, maybe this is why I do this, blah blah blah. Anytime someone tells a story I‚Äôll think of some story that‚Äôs related and have to tell it. 
Does anyone else do this? Feel this?",bpd_disorder
"I am here to get this off my chest. I can‚Äôt remember what my parents did to me but I do know that they‚Äôre abusive, that‚Äôs how it started, and going into my teenage years I didn‚Äôt not realize my actions, my pain, and my fears. I did not know my actions had consequences and I did not know that I needed help. 

Fast forward into my college years, that‚Äôs when my trauma unleashes and I developed new traumas as well, I had been dragged to hell and back and hurt a lot of people (some where not my fault) but it still messed me up, and going out of college, I realized that no matter how much I try and I apologize (yes I do apologize and i am aware of my own actions) I just go back to my ways and just find new people and hurt them and I don‚Äôt even realize that I‚Äôm hurting them and that‚Äôs when I got my diagnoses, I have been trying hard as f*ck and it‚Äôs kinda still not working. I refuse to make new friends and I refuse to date people not until I can afford therapy. 

I just want everyone to know that I have wonderful friends that actually care for me but sometimes I doubt myself like what if I am manipulating them and what if I‚Äôm unintentionally hurting them? All of my past romantic relationships have led to a mess. I have a high body count and I never knew that this was due to something (I stopped completely hooking up) (I only seek meaningful relationships now) 

These past few days I have been thinking about how badly I hurt people and the guilt is eating me up it‚Äôs almost chronic (yes I have apologized) I can‚Äôt help but wonder what if I hurt people people, I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I go on google and see people just talking about how people with bpd severely need therapy and it breaks my heart because I cannot afford that, I just want to live a happy and peaceful life without hurting anyone. I feel like my whole life is a lie, these past few days I feel like I do not know who I am and it breaks my heart so much especially because I have no idea where this all is leading to. I want to love people and be loved. I want to have healthy thoughts because I doubt myself.",bpd_disorder
"It‚Äôs a day late to post this but I thought why not (since I can‚Äôt quite mention it to anyone else close lol)
My (sadly toxic) fp and I made up for the first time in a terribly rocky month. After going back and forth and just it blowing out of proportion, I had daydreamed that at least I‚Äôd like an apology from him and a means to remain friends. 
Yesterday a friend said he (fp) wanted to know if he could keep my shirt (since he uh‚Ä¶ you know does his deeds to it apperntly) I told him that he shouldn‚Äôt make u do that and to tell him to talk to me personally. We unblocked one another and spoke like adults and managed to set up a time to meet up (since he said he wanted to clear the air etc)
And strangely enough, it kinda played out how I had daydreamed it. It was (of course both of us chugging Smirnoff‚Äôs) definitely the step in the right direction. I do regret allowing us to go the other direction (we stupidly did some frisky stuff after we hugged and apologized; he kept admitting he beats himself up for not allowing himself to have a good thing with me which I‚Äôm glad because he‚Äôs truly given me hell this past month like terrible splitting and seeking a way to fix this at all cost again‚Ä¶) but I did enjoy one thing: 
When he was hugging me he would pull away and kiss my forehead cheek and a normal kiss. It made me feel special like I was safe again‚Ä¶ (I‚Äôve always considered him strangely as my safe space since I have bad memories with males in general touching me) and just tell me he loves me and etc :‚Äô) it meant a lot last night‚Ä¶

He continued to behave the same cold and dismissive (sometimes saying or doing things to make me jealous again ugh it‚Äôs dumb) today at work and didn‚Äôt bother to suggest us hanging out tonight to drink or cuddle again :/

At least I have that peace now. I‚Äôll definetly keep doing my DBT workbook and just praying and daydreaming/manifesting for good things to come my way. 
I can‚Äôt count on him to be there for me if I split and breakdown but I can be there for him when he drunk calls me and he‚Äôs broken, cus ig at the end of the day, I can‚Äôt numb myself enough still to hate him yet. And maybe that‚Äôs better: maybe numbing myself isn‚Äôt the solution most days",bpd_disorder
"
I finally opened up to my mom (who was diagnosed with depression) about my personality disorder. I thought that maybe she would understand me just a bit more because she is also (to put it bluntly) mentally ill/ unstable. Last night we had a huge argument because she found out that I got tattoos without her knowledge and consent. I know that I've deceived her by hiding the tattoos for nearly two years but what hurts me the most is that she told me ""your body is mine and you ruined the most precious gift I gave you with these hideous ink on your back"" ""no amount of therapy is going to fix that sick head of yours"", all because I went to get tattoos. I'm 19 this year and I've never felt like I am in control of my life because she had been the one who decides on every single thing I do. 

No, I didn't get tattoos just to piss my mom off just because she thinks tattoos are a curse (in some asian household, there's a lot of superstition about tattoos bringing bad luck). To me, I didn't believe those sort of crap because I'm an atheist, I respect every religions but I dislike it when people force their religious beliefs on me. I just wanted to get a tattoo that has a meaning to me, something that belongs to me. 

I also think that it's unfair for her to use my illness against me in an argument. I just wished she could be more open and understanding. I get that she is angry and frustrated. I didn't mind getting grounded but to say things like ""you're never going to get better because you have BPD and the world seems to only revolve around you. You're wasting time going therapy. People like you are fucking selfish. You don't care about those around you."" It just hurts because all of these remarks came from my own mother &amp; as someone who had been living with depression her whole life, how is she stigmatising other mental disorders and invalidating pwBPD?",bpd_disorder

Regardless, I can‚Äôt help but overthink and try to sabotage this relationship by thinking that he might be just like my last relationships (abusive, toxic, etc‚Ä¶). I just think this is ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù because my relationships have been literal hell and it‚Äôs the first time that I‚Äôm feeling happy about a relationship.

I really feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be getting into this but I also feel that it‚Äôs just the BPD talking. The sexual part of the relationship also scares me since I‚Äôve been SA‚Äôd in the past and, since I haven‚Äôt done it in a while, it really scares me.

Every time i start to get closer to a group of friends, i think ‚Äúthis is fun for now, but eventually things won‚Äôt be the same, and they probably would have more fun without me anyway.‚Äù 

Its like even if i can convince myself that the current moment is ok (which is already hard to do alone) I have to remind myself that i KNOW it wont stay ok. Im so so very sure nothing will stay ok. 

And its almost impossible to use this in a comforting way, bc as soon as something bad happens its like my brain turns to self destruct mode. Like instead of thinking ‚Äúit‚Äôll get better‚Äù i think ‚Äúlook i knew nothing would stay ok, it never does, so before i get happy and hurt again lets just leave.‚Äù

"Wondered if anyone has any tips on responding assertively in the moment? 

If someone is actively hurtful, I find it far easier, but there's so many subtle ways people can be invalidating, condescending or trigger anxiety. When it happens my mind tends to space out as they continue talking and if I confront them, it's nearly always afterwards, which can feel completely pointless if it's something small.

I'm caught between struggling to read people during my interactions with them and distrusting my memory of said interaction because of my tendency to react to what was said later.

"I‚Äôm exhausted and depressed right now and wondering if I‚Äôll ever be able to be in a relationship again. I‚Äôve been in therapy for the past 8 months weekly, since I had an intense friendship breakup with my FP. I was suicidal for months and turned into a shell of a person afterwards. It was especially hard for me, because he was the only support I had. I dragged myself to therapy weekly, even though I just wanted to die and slowly rebuilt myself. Part of that rebuilding was starting to date again and I‚Äôve been in a 4 month open/ romantic friendship dynamic with someone. We started hanging out really regularly, going to events, hanging with each other‚Äôs friends, planning holidays together and they really became a pillar in my life. 

I went away on holiday for almost a month and communication between the both of us was pretty minimal and now I‚Äôm back in the city, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm a priority to them at all. They say they‚Äôve been busy, but I‚Äôve been reading into everything they‚Äôve done and not done and I feel insecure and played with. I just had a phone call with them and it triggered me so much, I was on the brink of an attempt. I feel like I HAVE to walk away from things because 1. when I get in this overthinking/ they don‚Äôt care as much about me space I can be unintentionally passive aggressive in communication, because I‚Äôm hurt (but this was one of the reasons my FP had to end our friendship) and 2.

"In my country we still have mask rules for health care providers and places where social distancing isn't available wearing masks is reccomended.

Now a few of my therapists have said some things that are concerning with covid.

1. My main therapist said that she hates wearing masks and she removed it when we were in my private session. I was obviously uncomfortable with it. 

2. During my skills training one of my therapists said ""they don't believe covid spreads through touch"" they said this while cleaning the objects we used during mindfulness. Like if it didn't spread through touch masks would have just stopped covid right?

Another thing thats stressful is that in group skills training one person keeps removing their mask and openly coughing while wearing a chin diaper. They were sniffling and coughing and said they didn't do a covid test.

I have other health conditions that make me have to take meds that lower my immune response to sickness. So the common cold could cause serve damages. It makes me very stressed and nervous going into group and one on one because of this.

Do I contact my therapist directly about how she makes me uncomfortable and do I ask to be put in a different group???

"Nothing but false promises have been hurting me so much. He promised to still be in my life no matter what... we hungout as friends when we brokeup and never heard from him... told me he would never breakup with me and did. I can't stand these false promises. Just what is the purpose? Especially when he knows I've been fucked over and have mental issues that I'm getting help with. We dates for 2 years...

well I went through some weird shit (relationships, selfharm, drugs, ss attempt, and so on). And in general I should be proud of myself for being out of that phase and being able to build up a new life with healthy long term goals I finally start to achieve and healthy habits. But some days, and it comes really unpredictably and suddenly, I wish to repeat that time. I wish myself back to the time when I felt so much, so confused, so sad, so intense. I don't know why. I miss the crazy people I was around back then who made me feel kind of special and understood. I am afraid of trying to repeat it and falling back again.. I don't want to sh anymore, I don't want to feel so lost and depressive and like my life does not make any sense. That time tho, it was terrible, it was the worst time of my entire life and I would never say I want to go back.. Normally. Why do I miss it, why does it feel so good to imagine to get completely high and lost and cover myself in blood just to feel something? I want to hang around in dirty flats or dirty places with drug addicts, stay up for days and watch bullshit. I want to destroy shit and I want to be f*cked whilst listening to the sadest music.

"Hi everyone. 

I‚Äôve not made a post on Reddit before but I‚Äôm starting to get frustrated and desperate. 

Just some context,

I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for the best part of 3 years. She has BPD and is constantly on ups and downs. I‚Äôve learnt to sort of deal with it, but I‚Äôm not a professional by any stretch and I often find it hard to help her.

She‚Äôs been through the doctors 3 times whilst we‚Äôve been together, which I think is incredibly brave given how she‚Äôs been treated. Each time she was told her symptoms were down to ‚Äúanxiety and low mood‚Äù or ‚Äúshe‚Äôs still growing up‚Äù (she‚Äôs 21in October) which seems to be a common theme with the NHS and Mental Health issues, prescribe some shitty medication and send her away. She‚Äôs also gone private, though they can‚Äôt help much as she hasn‚Äôt been formally diagnosed and private therapy is incredibly expensive, and we don‚Äôt have bags of money to spend. 

I think what I‚Äôm asking for is any tips on helping her, even in little ways, as well as possible avenues we can take to get her diagnosed and treat by a professional, as she‚Äôs been completely fobbed off by everyone she has spoken to as of yet. 

Any advice at all would be great. 

Thanks in advance!",bpd_disorder

"My fp hasn‚Äôt spoke to me for 2/3 weeks. It‚Äôs a rlly hard one to explain but I rlly need some help or advice so please stick with it 

For context: 
Had a big split on my fp 3 weeks ago bc they told me they prob wouldn‚Äôt be able to come and visit me for the week. We had planned this months ago as a way to know for definite when we‚Äôd see eachother next when we moved away from eachother end of may. The reasons for not being able to come were outside of both of our controls but I still snapped as I‚Äôd basically been using that visit as the only thing to hold on to and keep me going. They told me they‚Äôd let me know for definite on a certain date 

A week later and a few days past that date they hadn‚Äôt told me anything and eventually have me a short answer of ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt come been too busy to look at all the messages‚Äô 
And I‚Äôve heard nothing since. That was two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been busy before but I‚Äôve never not had enough time to send a very short text   

Anyway I kinda split again but very quickly snapped out of it and sent a lot of messages apologising n explaining my actions. I know that I am still responsible for my actions and I wasn‚Äôt trying to excuse them but to give context to them.  

I‚Äôve heard nothing since and I‚Äôve sent a few messages in between but I‚Äôm very conscious of it seeming like I‚Äôm harassing them so I‚Äôve kept it minimal. I also know that my fp has a tendency to isolate from everyone apart from their best mate when they‚Äôre rlly depressed and so I could just not be hearing from them bc of that but I can‚Äôt stop spiralling that this is all my fault. All I want is an answer on wether they‚Äôre done with me and if that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôll deal with that. I‚Äôve text them tonight to ask that and as of yet no response. 

It sucks a lot bc they‚Äôre one of my best mates , they know abt my mental health and have been one of the most supportive friends I‚Äôve had and we were like ridiculously close mates up until this. I‚Äôm hoping they just need space and that we can talk about it soon. I know I‚Äôve done things wrong and mill accept the consequences of my actions I just wanna know if I‚Äôm being unreasonable to want an answer on if their done with me or not ?

"I know for a fact that my BPD is causing me to feel these things for him. Two years ago, he roofied me and raped me. He wasn‚Äôt able to finish, because another guy (who was my crush at the time) saw what was happening and stopped it. I didn‚Äôt know this went down until over a year later. 

I always kind of knew something happened between us, but I didn‚Äôt know what. In the following weeks after what happened, my crush told a mutual friend that he liked me. I was really excited, but it turns out, he had a girlfriend the entire time. He cut off all contact with me. He did the right thing by cutting ties with me, but it was wrong of him to say that he liked me. 

I just felt so empty inside after my crush did that. My crush was the first guy to ever truly like me back, so it all just felt like a huge slap in the face. But my rapist reached out and checked on me. He asked me if I was okay, and he comforted me. He told me that I‚Äôm beautiful, and that it‚Äôs the other guy‚Äôs loss. He told me that my crush‚Äôs girlfriend isn‚Äôt even that pretty, and that I‚Äôm way more beautiful than her. He said that while he understood my crush wanting to not hurt his girlfriend, he thought my crush saying that he liked me was awful. 

Part of me wonders if he‚Äôs been genuine. If my rapist genuinely feels this way. All I know is that after, I fell in love with my rapist. I know. It‚Äôs sick. But keep in mind that I had no idea he even raped me until over a year later. But now that I know, I don‚Äôt even care all that much. Yeah, it‚Äôs disturbing, but he genuinely cares about me. 

It would be great if we got together and had kids. He was the one that saved me from heartbreak. He was my angel. He is my angel. My crush is actually single now, and still likes me, but I‚Äôm not paying him any mind. I still like him too, but what he did is unforgivable.

"I think that I have a deficit of positive personality traits and always have. I think I had a positive *persona* for about 17 years and it was heavily influenced by friends I had over the years. And I think if there is a deficit in ones personality, there's not really much to be done about that. 

I think I spent a long time thinking positive about my future, trying different hobbies, trying different jobs, making friends, dating, looking for subjects of interest - taking steps to try to find wholeness of self, contentment, pleasure, and a sense of purpose and I never made it there, then had a breakdown nine months ago, got diagnosed, had a lot of painful realizations about myself and my life and my prospects for my future. Since then, I've been in and out of ""the void"" (a state which I am not in right now but am constantly terrified of having return, because I know it will, over and over again, probably for the rest of my life, which makes the idea of continuing to live unbearable; a state in which I feel so empty it's like I'm not a person inside, total apathy, extreme boredom, excruciating despair, hopelessness, and helplessness; a state I have not found myself able to cope with and do not feel any more prepared for having it return than I was any of the times before. 

So I don‚Äôt know how thinking positive about my future, trying different hobbies, getting a job, being sociable, looking for things I'd like to learn about is going to yield any different results than it did before, when I did it for 30 years. 

Before I started doing theatre and found a sense of social belonging there, I was depressed (of the Borderline variety, not clinically depressed) most of the time. Even with that social belonging, I was prone to spells of depression. Then I realized, after 17 years of doing theatre, that I didn't actually enjoy it - that it had never really been about the art form for me. And I quit, because it had become harder and harder for me to do anymore. 

I've *always* spent most of my time with my friends espousing their enviable qualities to them, talking about how I wished I were different and the struggles I had, and seeking advice on how to live my life. 

I think, looking over my life, my personality traits are: lacking in determination and follow through, procrastinator, perpetually dissatisfied, overly dependent on others, dysthymic except when unstable (a more recent development for me), fickle, fearful, stubborn, easily bored, sad, distrustful, and envious. 

It‚Äôs hard for me to think of positive traits I have displayed as anything other than having been part of a *persona*, not a personality, and that‚Äôs *a lot* of negative *personality* traits to counter.¬†How can I possibly practice self-love or self-acceptance when that's the stuff I'm *actually* made of?",bpd_disorder

BF and I are both 22, and together 4 years. I was diagnosed with BPD 2 years ago. When I was diagnosed, I was really paranoid he was going to leave me, but he didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs been nothing but so supportive, loving, and understanding even when I‚Äôm a total bitch. 

I‚Äôve always been very outgoing and flirtatious with other guys. I‚Äôve never cheated or anything, but probably have done stuff that most would deem inappropriate given that I‚Äôm in a relationship.

"recently i have started to develop the most debilitating paranoia i have ever experienced, mainly centered around being paranoid that people are dead. almost completely at random. my boyfriend is my FP, and recently he has been going out much more often than he used to with his friends. i‚Äôm already paranoid about his friends in the first place because he does not usually reply quickly when he‚Äôs with them, but recently that has turned into panic attack level breakdowns about doubting his safety. for example, if he goes out to the mall and doesn‚Äôt reply for more than an hour, i immediately start uncontrollably sobbing and have, at that point, full-on convinced myself he is dead or that something terrible has happened. by the hour and a half mark, i will have sent probably 200 imessages and tried to call at least 15 times. i have desperately googled any accidents or tragedies in his area. i can not calm down until he comes back. i‚Äôve been putting forth absolutely all of my energy into refraining from doing this but it never works. i feel so bad. it‚Äôs worse when his phone dies, or even when he sleeps in a little late. i have sat there, staring, waiting for the delivered thing on imessage to move down for hours. i can‚Äôt focus on anything else. 

i don‚Äôt want to pin this on our relationship being unhealthy either, because it‚Äôs honestly the strongest relationship i‚Äôve ever had and he agrees in terms of himself. though the paranoia is mainly focused on him because he‚Äôs my FP, it‚Äôs with my family too. lack of response sends me into panic attacks for almost everyone about their safety. i have to walk into my moms room at least twice every night to make sure she‚Äôs just sleeping and not dead. i have traits of OCD so that part may be part of a compulsion but either way it‚Äôs still incredibly distressing. i have not gone a day without having at least two panic attacks for the last week. nothing helps until my body can‚Äôt handle it anymore and passes out for the night due to stress.

the only advice i have managed to receive is the basic ‚Äúremind yourself that these thoughts aren‚Äôt rational, build communication‚Äù advice, but it just doesn‚Äôt work. the severity of this is far too much for anything like that to even begin to graze the mindset i‚Äôm in when this happens. i don‚Äôt know what to do. does anyone else experience this?",bpd_disorder

TW: illness, possible BPD episodes, mental illness

I do have childhood trauma. My dad suffered from cancer for five years and the last six months were really traumatizing for my family in terms of his illness. He did eventually die. Also the rest of my family couldn't be emotionally there for me the entire time he was sick. So I felt really alone while and even after he died (I had really awful episodes of full-blown screaming and crying), and there were even times I threatened suicide. Keep in mind I was only 10.

I've suppressed and depersonalized a lot from my trauma and my therapist is helping me dig it all out. I'm also working on accepting that it was trauma and that it was bad.

Well anyways, symptoms:

My therapist says I do have some traits of borderline personality disorder (such as impulsively, rapidly shifting moods, and self harm and suicidal ideation). And when I mean fast shifting moods I MEAN FAST. Someone could say one thing and doesn't even mean it insultingly and it will cause me to downward spiral into obsessive thoughts and self destructive behavior. If it gets bad enough I can also get a panic attack which will cause me to demand my family members to get away from me while I contemplate on self destructive behavior. I can also trigger sort of manic episodes if there's just a lot of chaos (good chaos) going around or if I'm just feeling good. Lots of sugar and caffeine can also cause this.

In terms of abandonment issues they're pretty mild if even there at all. Like if I have a fight with my friends (which can get pretty out of control on my end) I can get paranoid that they'll never want to talk to me again. Or even if I say something I can start this. I'll just become convinced that they hate me and don't want to talk to me anymore. Mainly because I feel bad but I don't know. I guess this could also fall under the category of unstable relationships which was a big problem after my dad died.

I also have kind of an unstable view of myself. Like one day I could like myself and the next hate myself and fall into feelings of self-loathing.

I also have ongoing feelings of emptiness but I feel like that could be more from emotional suppression to dissassociation.

I think my therapist doesn't really know if I'll develop borderline because I'm only 15 and not an adult and I think she said that we'll just see how my personality continues to develop. But I wanted to ask you all anyways. Not if I have it just if I should look into it more.",bpd_disorder

"Is there an online test/tool you could use in testing your reflective functioning (mentalizing) capacities? It‚Äôs been written that people with BPD hyper mentalize on ways that are harmful due to deficits in their abilities to understand their own mental states and those of others. Basically hypermentalizing is ‚Äúprocess that involves making assump- tions about other people's mental states that go so far beyond observable data that others may struggle to see how they are justified‚Äù (https://uh.edu/class/psychology/clinical-psych/research/dpl/publications/_files/Sharp_Vanwoerden_2015.pdf)

I‚Äôve looked for the reflective functioning questionnaire (RFQ) but I‚Äôm not sure how the scores can be put into context or averaged.

I‚Äôm trying to do away with the hypervigilance, the constant needs for validation and reassurance and I get that the mentalizing and poor, primitive constructs of my experiences and those of others are definitely at play here in the issues I‚Äôve had in my life.",bpd_disorder

"My first post and second language so sorry in advance. 
I 22f was diagnosed with bpd after a prison sentecing in 2018. I used my time since then to gratuate the equivient of highschool and raising my dog. I tried cutting out the people who were toxic and working on my self while going through different psyco thearaputic -? (like appointments, classes and stuff). My family and I are no longer on speaking terms, I have zero close friends or long time relations and no boyfriend or favorite person for the first time ever and I feel the loneliness and emptiness everyday since finishing school and not really doing anything besides smoking weed and drinking to numb the lonelines. I put myself out there despite my ptsd and fear of rejectment, but always tend to seem standoffish or overshare, and the continue to overthink and feel ashamed for said oversharing. Those new people I have met, always give of 'good vibes', but I am trying to find friends, and I am usually the only one to intigate contact and I have trouble differentiating wether I am overthinking and maybe trying too hard, or that these people are just not the right friends for me and that they are just politely tolerating me.

"For the people who have been in long-term relationships, have you had any success after your partner grows tired? For more information, we've been married for a little over 5 years. For most of it, I wasn't diagnosed. Now that I am, I'm starting to notice every way I've affected our relationship but mostly how it has affected my partner. For example, he doesn't go anywhere to avoid a reaction. He doesn't talk to many people to avoid a reaction. I've actually made a lot of progress so far, no where near perfect and I mess up sometimes. I want him to enjoy things. I want him to have friends and be happy. I absolutely do not want him to feel like he has to walk on eggshells. I love him and I don't want to hurt him any longer. But I can tell he's tired, absolutely drained. He lives the same day every day because anything out of routine may set me off. I hate it. I know he loves me, but he isn't happy. And he won't leave me. And maybe I'm being selfish by not doing it for him. Because I want this. I want him and our forever. So if I keep doing the work, can this work? How can I show him that things can be different? I urge him to make plans. But he still won't because ""it'll be more trouble than it's worth"". It feels like he's not giving me the chance to be better. I know I can though.",bpd_disorder

"Unfortunately, due to poor past relationships, I now see all interactions in the form of a power play.  And I want to win--because when I am winning, I feel loved and safe and like the rug isn't about to get pulled out from under me.

However, I feel like my BPD is a handicap in that regard.  I forever feel like I am ""too much"", like I have to filter out these strong intense feelings or they will overwhelm other people and make them lose interest in me.  My go-to for years has to been to try not to show emotions to other people at all because I think I look weak when I do.   My new person is LESS overly anxious / obviously needy than my last one.  He is a little harder to ""win"" with.  I am obviously so excited about him(new person) and want to gush all over the place, but I know that other people do not find that attractive.  

My new person is online.  It is what it is.  When we are together on voice, I think I am clearly the stronger personality.  I am more direct than he is, more opinionated, more to the point.  He seems charmed by that(the confidence, I mean).  Over voice, I am the boss lady and he seems quite enamored with me and says very vulnerable things.  But with time and distance; text/messaging, I soften, my insecurities come out and my more gushy, emotional side just pours out and it makes me deeply uncomfortable.  In those times, I think he holds more power.

I've been trying SO hard to look chill and unaffected and secure and not to act on insecurities, but now I realize that in being so unaffected and considerate--I might be having the opposite effect.  Like maybe I look \*too complacent\*.  Like sure, do whatever you want, I'm cool with it.  I'll just be right here waiting.  Take your time.  

And that, to me, is HORRIBLE.  I don't know how to find balance.  I just oscillate wildly between being too soft, sweet and gushy to being too chilly, too bossy, and icy.  

How do other people accomplish balance between these feelings?",bpd_disorder

All I want is a solid relationship and I‚Äôve worked so hard to better myself and be a more reliable person. I‚Äôve come so far and the people who‚Äôve stuck around (love them) tell me that I‚Äôm doing much better.

I just don‚Äôt understand how people can tell me that I‚Äôm special or that I ‚Äúfeel like a breath of fresh air‚Äù and then leave. Do people just see me as a stepping off point? I don‚Äôt know.

Being part of the LGBT community also makes this more difficult as I‚Äôll have to hide my sense of style to fit into the societal norms (where I live).

"So! I was just diagnosed yesterday by my psych. He‚Äôs been low key considering this diagnosis for a while but he‚Äôs a pretty aggressively responsible psych he wanted to ensure that it was correct (data collection, ruling other things out, environmental factors, med tinkering, etc) and that I was in a place where I could hear that. He also isn‚Äôt writing it anywhere due to the stigma so I‚Äôm never denied care (instead writing ‚Äúsevere emotional disregulation), and we had a really long and in depth discussion about it.

This honestly makes a lot of sense and is‚Ä¶kind of a relief in a weird way? It‚Äôs nice knowing that I‚Äôm just like, not crazy? But it‚Äôs also just a lot to take in. 

We discussed different things to potentially alleviate symptoms and I wanna eventually do DBT, but he was very upfront with me about the fact that it sucks and is hard and takes years. He‚Äôs really good about being completely and totally honest with me, and even showed me what the homework might entail (yay informed consent!) and I‚Äôve decided that I am not currently ready to start DBT. Again, I think this‚Äôll be really good for me later, just not right yet.

"I had heard a while back that the manifestation of symptoms of people diagnosed with borderline personality disorder can sometimes change with age especially within their 30s and 40s. I‚Äôm in my late 30s and have noticed that my anger and irritability has really increased since my late 20s early 30s (I can literally feel myself about to punch a wall if something minor happens even non-person related such as my vacuum cleaner won‚Äôt pick something up or something not working for me and so making me invest more energy or time into something when I want to get on with the day). I‚Äôm constantly on the verge of losing it over the stupidest things that I recognize are minor set backs. Also- I find myself pretty much annoyed with everyone. Like all the time. Whereas I was never much of a people person I didn‚Äôt get annoyed simply being in a crowd of people at a food store for example. But within the past couple years it‚Äôs like just hearing other people talk sometimes can be enough to set me off even if it‚Äôs nothing negative towards me or even towards me at all!

Has anyone else experienced this? Could it be from an accumulation of disappointments and letdowns by people my entire life ( mother was BPD/covert NPD nightmare and I really fly off the handle with her easier than ever too) to the point where just seeing another human puts me on edge? It‚Äôs like a default misttust and dislike of all people until/unless I talk one n one with them and find them to be ‚Äònice‚Äô (manifestation of splitting??) but of course if they then let me down it‚Äôs back to ‚ÄòOh I should‚Äôve known better.. just another piece of crap person‚Äô

Funny side note: i jokingly say say that when i geT angry about even something minor I feel like those Warner Brothers cartoons when a hammer hits the cartoons foot and the temperature gauge goes from 0 to 100 and bursts at the top lol. Anyone relate???

"Hello, recently my boyfriend broke up with me and this left me feeling extremely empty and going in and out of depressive episodes and just causing me to feel so many emotions and once. He keeps talking about his friends and stuff to me and he just seems so much happier without me. This really hurts as he is my FP. We still talk quite a bit but just as friends but whenever he mentions stuff about his friends or other people flirting with him or about how many women he gets, it really gets on my nerves as I have extremely bad issues with being jealous and like it causes me to fall back into these depressive episodes and self isolate as I don't know how else to cope.

This man has got my emotions all over the place, he confuses me so much. He has told me many times that he has moved on from me and that we probably will not get back together. I don't really know what to do. I feel like nothing without him like I feel absolutely empty and as I do not have a therapist right now life is so hard to deal with I really don't have many friends either. I have nothing. And because I'm autistic as well making friends isn't very easy for me. I feel absolutely hopeless sometimes I feel as if nothing is going to get better I always feel like a terrible person as well for my actions as I'm very impulsive. I don't know maybe I'm just jealous of him being able to move on in like a week and having all these friends and I have been sort of left behind to just suffer as I don't really have anyone. It's so unfair I really don't know what to do every day is a struggle like BPD has taken over my entire life I feel so out of touch with reality like so disconnected from my body at times it's just the worst.

I want to get myself out of this, I don't know how to though because every time I think I'm getting better I realize nothing is I just had one or two good days and the rest of the week is shit. I don't know how to change the way I think, I don't know how to deal with myself. Sometimes I feel as if it would be better for me to just die. Life doesn't feel worth living for me currently. But the only reason I'm still here is that I have hope for the future. I believe that one day things will get better just at this current moment and time it is how it is. My issue is getting myself out of this. I've gone through so much in life I feel as if I would be better without people around me, as I can't deal with the emotions people trigger for me. Maybe I should just let go of my ex and move on and act as if nothing ever happened but I know in reality I can't do that because without him I feel like nothing.

If anyone has advice on how to get myself out of this and how to stop feeling like this I will really appreciate that, lately, I've been just trying to find other people to become obsessed with but I only ever look for anyone that I see parts of my ex in as I feel like there is no one else out here like him.

"DAE ever feel like this? Is this typical BPD behavior?

I always thought it was my abandonment issues that I was always jealous if my husband gave attention to another woman esp if attractive  but now I‚Äôm noticing it goes beyond that I find myself getting jealous and irritable if he gives a lot of attention to his parents even like I get very aggravated if I feel they ask more from him than they should even though they‚Äôre elderly  and then he will go and do it for them I end up feeling like he is ‚Äúchoosing ‚Äúthem over me even though technically I don‚Äôt need anything from him at the time! A lot of resentment has built bc ive asked him to tell th em ‚Äòno‚Äô sometimes and he never does bc he says they ‚Äòneed‚Äô him. For some reason this is extremely triggering to me. 

Also, even more ridiculous.. getting super aggravated if I‚Äôm trying to talk to him about something and he is fiddling on his phone or watching a tv commercial I will yell at him what‚Äôs so interesting sbout this damn commercial. I get so annoyed. 

So I‚Äôm starting to realize it has nothing to do with  attention he gives  romantically but actually any kind of attention that has taken off of me I get resentful about. Tv-parents or even sometimes work calling that he stops listening to me for etc. 

Furthermore I really  think this is a pattern from childhood bc when this occurs I do the same to family members I get extremely aggravated and jealous of my mother for example tells me she can‚Äôt talk about something right now because she have to go tend to her grandkids who is a three month old. I immediately get upset like I‚Äôm your daughter I come first. I recognize a baby has more pressing needs but her telling me she doesn‚Äôt have time for me is extremely triggering

Even as a child I would get extremely resentful toward my 8-12 year younger siblings if my mom left me to tend to them or even allowed them to ask her for something while I was talking to her.

"How do I love myself when I am alone and have no identity? I've been isolating myself for the past 7 years to keep myself from hurting others, and I'm not sure if it's working. But all it's done is point out all of my issues and show me that I haven't changed. I struggle the most from taking interactions with a grain of salt. Everyone seems very fake and drained when talking to me, and I become very desparate, but as someone who might be struggling with alexithymia, I can't express that.

"This isn't the usual thing in relationships I experience. This is different. My ex and I broke up a while ago but all through the relationship and even now I think about his twin sister. 

I don't like his sister I never have. I tried to like her by going places with her and talking to her. And she's okay but she rubs me the wrong way. I just don't like her. I feel like I'm always trying to prove myself to her.

I've recently started talking to my ex again as friends and it's making me think about her more. Is this something different or could this be related to bpd?

I really don't want to think about her all the time. I haven't even talked to her in a year and I never see her except for the rare run in at the gym.

I've blocked her on social media to help with it so I can't look her up either. It feels like something out of my control. I can't help but want to know what she's doing. What is going on?",bpd_disorder
"I liked him because he was different.  

Right before my rediagnosis for bpd and a few months ago and finding this subreddit, I actually told this person he was my favorite person. I genuinely meant it. To my fucking horror ... when I came here and realized what this actually meant. 

He is a narcissist and took advantage of me mentally and emotionally. He admitted this to me. I feel like he's watching all the time. Even here, I know its silly. My ocd, ptsd won't let it go. I have multiple people that know and have witnessed his behavior towards me. 

I made very fucking AWFUL mistakes and judgements.  For years I could not FOR THE LIFE OF ME figure out WHY I was doing this. Damn it all clicked. It just hit me and I had to sit and think about it for a long ass time. I finally was able to let it go.

He is still not over it. He is blocked on everything. I've had to sever friendships, leave communities, and hide from this guy because he   can't respect boundaries when I say its over this time. Im changing my IP, making a new account, keeping the friends closest to me.. and just moving the fuck on. It feels great.  My mind is free.... just because I understand and want to change and correct my behavior.

"I would like some insight into how others take the meaning of words, like friend.

I'm a literalist, if a word is used, I will generally stick the traditional definition of the work, because I believe that is the common belief around it.  I understand words sometimes have double meanings, and slang usage, but I stick to traditional definitions as slang usage has gotten me into trouble before.

I recently found out, that words don't quite mean the same thing to everyone, like the word friend.  When someone says I'm their friend, that makes me legit happy.  I feel like we can share our feelings and secrets with each other and be like the stories you read in grade school of characters being best of friends. Staying in constant contact and being there for each other.  In reality, it seems friend to some people, just means you're good in my book and nothing more.  If that's the case, why not just say ""X, I like you, you're good in my book""?

I'm feeling torn because if someone calls me a friend and I like them, I'm learning that **maybe** they don't mean friend the way I would use it.  If that is true, then what is the point of words in terms of relations to people?  Why even bother?  I feel like you really don't ever truly know someone, which makes me distrustful of people, but this thing I'm noticing about words not meaning the same thing is really troubling.",bpd_disorder
"This is my first time posting in this subreddit, so I apologize if this isn't organized or anything.

I recently learned (2021) that I struggle with BPD. I struggled admitting to myself any of the pain or the true debilitating nature of my BPD, and especially the ways it affects me about romance.

I am not ready for romantic love, which is not to say I don't deserve it (hard to think I do after this), but I am not ready, and I'm willing to admit that now which I wasn't before. I don't think there was a way for me to ever be ready for a relationship. I am 22 years old, and I recognize I have full responsibilities for my actions even if my intentions are different from my actions, but I do not have any of the emotional skills a 22 year old should have. I feel like a child emotionally developmentally speaking, I don't know if that is common but it's the way I feel.

However this conclusion only came to me after a time of crisis. I cheated on this person, we were not officially dating, however we were committed to each other and it was completely my idea to do so, and I spent a lot of effort to break down their walls because I genuinely thought and had the intention that I could be the best person possible for them but I could not be that without helping myself.

My childhood wasn't great, my dad used to be addicted to drugs before I was born and was/is an active alcoholic, I recognize the ways me and my dad are similar but he refused to get help for himself at any point (He's now 60 yo), my mother has put up with my dad's abuse the entire time they've been married, it took me until this week to realize the way my dad treats my mom isn't how any person deserves to be treated. However, my view of love is poisoned because I never got love (or felt it) from people it was supposed to come from. My dad abused me when I was younger and still continues to emotionally abuse me, and did not have any skills to pass onto me to cope with any traumas or illnesses or anything.

Besides that though, I was SA'd multiple times when I was a child from a really early age (between 8-11, I literally cannot remember when it occurred to me at all, which I think was a survival response from my brain, I wish my brain could've just completely blanked out that that happened but I can't. Every time that I should've gotten love from my family I wasn't met with love, and I don't think it's out of genuine want to hurt me or anything just I recognize I don't think my parents should have had me, because the conditions I was raised in weren't conductive to me having a healthy mental state unless I was getting support from a young age which I didn't. I also was groomed on the internet many many times from childhood all the way throughout all of highschool. I fed off the attention of disgusting people because I felt like that is what I deserved, and talking to those people was some of the only forms of attention I was getting as a child.

My intention in telling the above information is not to ask for pity, regardless of how I was treated, I shouldn't have treated this person this way if I truly loved them, because you do not cheat on a person you love. But I couldn't even love them, they were the first person to provide me true genuine love, and I couldn't do anything but reject it. Almost every romantic situation beyond this one went bad for me, I have terrible taste in people and I've continually met people who met me with more trauma. I was always the second option in every situation and I've been cheated on in every situation, which would make me think since it happened to me I would never do it to someone else but I did it to them.   


They have expressed that they want to be with me, like it is a genuine want in their brain however they cannot be with me, and I understand that now (during a 3 hour phone conversation last night I didn't understand this at all, and was just begging for them to stay over and over). They want to be with me, that's what their brain wants however, the conclusion they've come to every time is that they cannot be with me because their paranoia won't allow them to. I am willing to put in all of the work that is required to help them heal from that because I am not capable of hurting them in that way anymore (I know some may not believe me but I can only admit that now knowing I was capable of hurting them before because I had terrible coping mechanisms to deal with that.

They told me to move on, they told me I needed space from them so I could move on, but my brain feels a genuine need to fix this relationship if it's possible, and I am just wondering if it's able to be fixed. I want to love them and think I can be a genuine loving and healthy partner for them I just needed therapy in order to process all of my traumas. I don't think I am saying something wrong in saying that, but regardless of how I feel now, and my desire to be a better person, the overwhelming thought in their brain is me hurting them and I just don't know if I can ever fix that. So I am asking for perspective.

"I posted a few days ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/we4bws/my_bf_doesnt_want_this_to_be_a_part_of_our_life/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Basically my bf of 3 years has anger issues (in my opinion) and is constantly annoyed / frustrated bc of something. He has a really short fuse. 
In the post I said I forgot why we fought, but I remember now: I made him a cup of coffee that morning and because he wanted to cuddle, I put it down in its usual spot in front of his bed (he doesn‚Äôt have a nightstand). As he got up his blanket got into the coffee and he very said ( very annoyed and frustrated): ‚Äúwhy did you have to put it there?! Now my blanket is wet!!!‚Äù
Just for context‚Ä¶

Since Wednesday night I have a very weird pain in my chest and wanted to go to the doctor today (yesterday was too hot to leave the house and these pains are unfortunately not new to me). He was supposed to leave work at 9:15 and be home 5 minutes later. I called him to ask if he wanted to come with me and if so, if he could not stay longer today, as the doctor is only available till 12. 

He said that he definitely wants to go with me as he didn‚Äôt want anything to happen to me on my way there. 
He came home 45 minutes late. Didn‚Äôt call beforehand or let me know or anything. Told me he had to stay longer bc of some training stuff (which apparently he knew in beforehand as apparently this is every Friday). I was a bit annoyed but mostly stressed out because with time for travel that only left us 1.5h for the doctor and I didn‚Äôt have an appointment so I knew it would be very stressful anyways.

He was super stressed out and annoyed/ angry with me that I was stressed out and apparently ‚Äúfollowed him everywhere though he just came home and wants to relax a bit‚Äù
I said that we have to go now. He told me that I play the victim again, I‚Äôm selfish and I could‚Äôve gone to the doctor already on my own if it were so important to me to be there early. And that if I could go there by train it can‚Äôt be that bad. And that he didn‚Äôt eat anything yet, is tired from work and just wants to relax for a bit before we go. 

I got annoyed with him as well and told him I‚Äôll go alone and that working for three hours isn‚Äôt really all that stressful, which was rude I know. 
He followed me desire me telling him to leave me alone and that I want to go to the doctor alone. On the way there he berated me some more but eventually apologised - even though I told him we could talk about this later, not in public, and that I don‚Äôt want to accept his apology right now. 

He apologised nonetheless and just kept being annoyed and frustrated for the rest of the visit and the necessary grocery shopping afterwards. He now is very annoyed at me as I told him I want to spend some time alone. Idk if you got the picture yet‚Ä¶ he is a very annoyed person ;)


So.  I love him I guess, but his behaviour I cannot tolerate any longer. There‚Äôs so much more that I cannot post here for we all have better things to do; how am I supposed to act now?


I think breaking up is the sensible thing to do as some of you guys suggested as well under my first post. 
We live together and he‚Äôs somewhat financially dependent on me. When I wanted to break it off the last time, he said he‚Äôs gonna leech off of me as long as possible and that he won‚Äôt move out. He‚Äôs not an official tennant (?) for this flat (moved in with me after his mother lost their flat) and has nowhere else to go. No money no nothing.   I don‚Äôt want him to spiral into depression and worries because of me breaking up with him. I also don‚Äôt want to be petty and break up because of some minor issue that can be fixed. He apologised ‚Ä¶

"A few weeks ago (yes, I'm still thinking of it) my friend had jokingly told me I had no friends when I mentioned something about one of my irl friends. It hurt me but you know, I registered it was a joke to him so I didn't comment on it. I have never been an open person nor have I ever really had a deep-ish connection except with another friend I had who in my opinion, has BPD and she did use to agree but she's gone really radical and doesn't even believe it exists, but that's unrelated.

Like I said before I am not emotionally open, not to my family and especially not to my friends, I don't know why and I can't think of any underlying cause. I cannot make deep connections. I hate texting and calling my real life friends, the only people I enjoy texting are my online friends and maybe it comes from the fact I never really texted real life people when I was younger so it's super awkward? (I have been on the internet since I was like 7 and I'm almost 15 right now so..) I don't like having my irl friends in my online life and only enjoying seeing them irl and nowhere else. 

Online all my friends are simply my friends. if I'm close to you then I talk to you but that's all we do. We talk. I have never had a meaningful romantic relationship and am probably aromantic so even more reasons why I'm an antisocial freak, but I wish I could connect to people. I want deep relationships.

"TW: suicidal thoughts

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I have a significant trigger which I can‚Äôt avoid. My partner broke off our engagement over a year ago for reasons. He was justified in doing that. Now it‚Äôs just over a year later and he still won‚Äôt commit to me in that way despite occasionally talking about when we get married.

I can‚Äôt cope. I agreed to a new engagement ring thinking it meant he would want to be back on but I was wrong and that triggered a meltdown. I then thought when it arrived maybe he would do it then but he said no he still has things he needs to get over. He was fine with the idea of having promise rings but it‚Äôs not enough to me and feels childish being that we live together and have children and basically are married in everything but legal terms. 


Anyway this triggered a huge meltdown in me. I was supposed to take my son to the hospital for an appointment. I struggled out of bed just before we had to leave and went with him but I couldn‚Äôt talk because I knew if I did it would just end badly. He texted me calling me mature. I texted back why I couldn‚Äôt speak. He didn‚Äôt see those messages until I snapped on the walk to the hospital and just completely broke down. I had a panic attack. Then I nearly ran out into the road in front of cars. I eventually dragged myself to the hospital but was just hurling abuse at my partner because I‚Äôm so hurt. He just stopped responding. Only one parent is allowed in with a child and I‚Äôm not allowed to be on my own with my children because of my risk of self harm and suicide lately. 

I then left them both there. I‚Äôve gone off to a park somewhere to just sit. He doesn‚Äôt know where I am. He‚Äôs not answering my messages. I feel guilty because my baby is at the hospital and though probably ok I‚Äôm scared in case he isn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm just a failure of a mother. The whole way back to the park I kept considering jumping in front of cars or in front of the train I was on. 

I‚Äôve tried so hard to get better. I‚Äôve done all I can and I‚Äôve done all I can to make things better for my partner but it‚Äôs not enough. He wants things from me I only feel I can give when I‚Äôm secure but he won‚Äôt give me that security. He says just being there is enough but I feel I can‚Äôt trust that he doesn‚Äôt want to just walk away. I am convinced he just doesn‚Äôt want to be the bad guy and leave me because he knows that may be the end of me. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt know how to deal with my trigger. I‚Äôve had two failed engagements, one of which is with him. We‚Äôve had couples counselling and individual counselling but he won‚Äôt move at the pace I need and it‚Äôs literally destroying me",bpd_disorder

I haven't seen my very close friend for about a month now, and i couldn't see her a couple of days ago because i was simply unable to function.

I offered her to meet any other time and place and tried to explain why i can't attend the party, but she is still convinced im lying about my emotional volatility and that im just being an asshole. I don't know what to tell her and it's making me hate myself, please offer advice if you can.",bpd_disorder
"I think about her all the time, I have dreams where we get back together like every night. But I always have to remind myself that I will never see her again. Even after everything she did; she smeared my name making up lies saying I was physically abusive and said she never wanted to see me again after she dumped me out of the blue one day. it left me traumatized. regardless I still miss her, because when she was good she was my best friend, she was the most amazing person I had ever met and she made me feel like a human for once. 

Before I met her I had no one, no friends and I was honestly on the brink of suicide, I didn‚Äôt feel like a person. But then this girl came in and made me feel loved and appreciated, she gave me a family and showed me a world of excitement and adventure. She changed me for the better.

I basically became a member of her family, I was with them every day. We got a fucking summer job together man. And I became an active member of her church, and her friend group and now I can never see any of them ever again. 

That‚Äôs the thing that hurts the most though, because with a normal relationship no matter how bad it ended there‚Äôs always hope you can reconcile with your ex one day. I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôd all agree it would be a terrible idea to ever reach out again no matter the circumstance. With my ex, reaching out and trying to reconcile no matter how long it has been would be a bad idea because she‚Äôd either hurt me even more or try to hoover me back into another relationship where i‚Äôd get hurt. 

It‚Äôs almost impossible for my brain to accept that she‚Äôs gone and she‚Äôs never coming back. Everything we did together, all the adventures we had, the stuff we learned about each other was for nothing. I‚Äôll never talk to her again, I‚Äôll never get to sit with her and watch our favorite show, I‚Äôll never get to carry her to her bedroom again when she passed out on the couch, I‚Äôll never get to just hug her and feel her love, ever. again.",bpd_disorder
"I could come up with a dozen theories as to why I think I do. I had an abusive mother and a near non-existent relationship with my father. My childhood was filled with verbal and physical abusive and chaos. I‚Äôve witnessed intense and terrifying anger outbursts from my mom growing up, and I became genuinely afraid of her. I didn‚Äôt feel safe at home, nor did I feel loved. I was sexually assaulted by my cousin. When I reached my adolescence, I started looking for interaction outside of the family, but I couldn‚Äôt form or maintain friendships. I didn‚Äôt have friends until highschool. I made friends who I didn‚Äôt have anything in common with, and then I made other friends who I did. The first time I ever told anyone ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù was with them at the age of 17. I suffocated them. I pulled back before I could really push them away. I even tried leaving but they stuck around and even stayed by my side despite me dissipating constantly. 9 years later and they‚Äôre my best friends. Now I‚Äôm healthier, I have a good healthy relationship with my family and my friends. But during that time I where I felt abandoned by friends and family, I looked for love in girls. And ever since it‚Äôs been addicting. I‚Äôm not the most handsome guy, but I guess I‚Äôve had my share of flings. But it‚Äôs never enough. I‚Äôm not handsome enough to always have a girl available to validated me in any way. So the search for any girl to pay attention to me is just terrible. And I know it‚Äôs bad to think and behave the way I do. But I can‚Äôt help it. I want to be loved. I want to be desired. I want to feel like I‚Äôm worth it. I want to never feel rejected or unworthy, but that‚Äôs all dating is for me. And I‚Äôve tried going to therapy and working out and doing everything I can to be grateful for what I have instead of what I don‚Äôt have.

"undiagnosed borderline here.
for context im gonna tell you what my pharmacological path has been to this day.
i started taking a small dose when i started therapy, for my anxiety and my insomnia, which tbh actually helped me, but too many things happened in my life and even though it always had been a recurring thought, i attempted suicide with these meds, so yeah, my psychiatrist decided to change my whole medication and gave me a ton of new meds, which i didn't want to take because i hate the feeling of having to depend on some kind of substance to be happy, so even though for a brief period of time i would follow my meds therapy, after a while i would stop taking them.
a couple of months ago i started to feel the constant feeling that i couldn't remember anything from my past, except i got triggered (for example, one time i remembered i had this hobby with a special person which consisted in bringing back to life old shoes, and it only got to my mind because i saw a tiktok, but i really struggled), so this plus the fact that i hate being on meds at all, brought me into quitting again.
it's been two months and i actually feel kind of better without them, but people expect me to take them since meds = no suicide, but yk, i just feel numb when im on meds. not happy. still sad af. but extremely numb.
also, i feel like meds brought away my ""spark"", if you know what i mean. i don't feel like myself anymore.",bpd_disorder
"so, it's been a while since i started thinking people tend to treat me differently because im an undiagnosed borderline (been in therapy for two years, ive done every kind of DSM-5 test n shit, but psychologists and psychiatrists here are reluctant to give a diagnosis).
less than one year ago my dad died of cancer, and since i have a way older sister e too many problems with my bipolar mom i decided to live with my sister, who has two daughters that are basically my age. anyways, me and my nieces are very different, im a very calm person and i always try to keep it cool even when we're having a big fight, on the contrary they don't see any problem in shouting and screaming all the way around; lately i started noticing that my sister is always kind of sweet with me, and when we talk about my mental health she always makes sure to make me know that since im a borderline im a ""disabled"" person, which honestly kinda pisses me off.
like, i know i have a ton of problems due to my disorder, but why do people treat you like you're dumb? sometimes i really feel like my friends and family see me as a poor kid, kinda disappointing.

"So, I posted the other day about being confused about the motives behind an ex-friend with BPD's intentions &amp; feelings of why she ghosted me a few months ago. I chalk some of it up to splitting, but it's gotten to a point where I don't know if that's *just* it. To explain, I *do* feel that she started splitting on me in the month leading up to her ghosting me. She started saying things in DMs on Discord that would indicate that's what was going on, mainly that I did things I wasn't for reasons I wasn't.

However, there's a few wrenches thrown in since that lead me to think that there's more going on here.

For 1, I never got an apology or an admission that that's what was going on &amp; an honest effort to make things better on her part, despite the fact that she in the past had shown to me that she could easily recognize when her BPD influenced her thoughts &amp; actions in other instances.

2, she's been making Twitter posts since she ghosted me that indicate that she legitimately thinks I'm a terrible person; posts about how I'm like an actually awful dude we both knew over 2 years ago &amp; how people were showing her ""true friendship"" by doing things similar to things she &amp; I did, mainly watching a show she likes together with them even though we did the same thing with movies &amp; YouTube videos when we were friends.

3, she took a message I sent her explaining how she was wrong about some of these things &amp; pointing out other things as ""schizo"" &amp; victimizing a mutual friend of ours just because I sent him 2 messages that weren't actually that bad &amp; he told her about them after I did.

I talked with someone on here in the replies to the other post &amp;, while I had thought it was petulant BPD, they said that it was probably more of the impulsive type, which I can see, as both cause more narcissistic traits to crop up. However, I don't know if what's going on with her is just that, or if something else could b going on. If anyone can help me figure this out, I'd be grateful.",bpd_disorder

I asked why she answers like that and she said it‚Äôs tiring because I always talk and ‚Äò‚Äôwhine‚Äô‚Äô about the same. i was a little surprised and weirded out by her answer, than she told me she feels like she is too tired herself to deal with other peoples emotions, I asked her what bothers her and we talked about it, I felt really bad for her being so overwhelmed and I saw her struggles, I realized that maybe she doesn‚Äôt see me because I never tried to see her as well and when she tried to tell or hint me I didn‚Äôt care that much. we both ended this conversation on a really positive note and I went to sleep satisfied.

Afterwards, I just kept searching for someone to love me and care about me. My home was toxic and abusive so I moved far away from them to better myself.

 I again dropped out of school and decided to enjoy my time away from my home at my new apartment with my new partner at the time. I realized I was toxic and abusive myself and decided I needed therapy to focus on my trauma. Because of my need to fix myself I never quite finished school and since I was always depressed and anxious I wasn't the best in shape. I have adhd and that makes doing school work even harder for me. I never finished school and I am a bit overweight. 

My now ex (M25)...would always tell me to lose weight. He said I have nothing else to offer him and that he could find someone hotter, with a citizenship, career, family, less mental issues, some accomplishments and someone who doesn't nag. That completely broke me. We were talking about making it work until he got to a point where he decided he didn't want to settle. I've been struggling with my mental health and have been taking medication and talking to a therapist. I'm currently going to school (a major he doesn't approve of) and in the process of getting my visa. I'm working on my weight and now that I finally got approved for adhd meds I can finish school. I know I'm not in a good point in my life. He's right, I don't have much to offer and I haven't been my best emotionally. He wasn't good at letting me express myself and that made me feel invalidated. He blocked me after I begged him to give me a chance to improve. I begged him to give me space and to go back on a break so that at least we'll be together some day. He kept saying no and blocked me and said it's for my own good. He said he's going to block me for a couple months and to focus on myself (get my shit together). That I have to learn to live without him.

I don't think I can live a life without him. I don't see myself with anyone else. I was willing to look past his own flaws. I never did feel good enough for him and now I know I'm not. He's the first person I've ever loved. I don't want to live a life without him.  I don't want to live anymore. I hate myself and I hate that I'm so damaged and broken.

"Someone very important to me who has BPD has started talking to this guy. She seems to really have feelings for him but he treats her like shit. Everyone in her life who knows is extremely worried about her and I'm at a point where I'm not sure what to do. They haven't met in person but here are some of the things he's done so far:

Started masturbating to her on call without asking. She could tell because he was shaking. It made her so uncomfortable she had to hang up.

She had a friend visit from across the country. He got mad at her for not ditching her to call him.

Told her that he sees her as a lesser valued human being because she's on disability

Slut shamed her for having hsv

Told her she's not allowed to talk to her male friends because ""a shoulder to cry on becomes a pole to ride on""


And that's just a couple examples. There are more things. She grew up in an abusive household and she's putting herself back in that situation. We are all extremely worried about her but she insists that she loves him. We are all convinced it's a really bad BPD episode. How do we save her from this?",bpd_disorder

I have been feeling like I have BPD for a few months now. I have all the major issues like self harm, attachment/ fp, major mood swings, unstable relationships, massive irritability, impulsive, etc etc etc. I wanted help and this is how it went. 

D: is there anything else you have questions about?

Me: yes I was wondering who I would contact about screening for BPD. 

D: what?

Me: borderline personality disorder. 

D: what are you suicidal?

Me: no. 

D: a personality disorder?

Me: yeah. 

D: why would you think that? Did someone tell you that?

Me: no it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve been thinking about it. 

D: well you have to call a psychiatrist. 

I am so upset that she questioned me like that. Is it not ridiculous that the only question she asked me if I was suicidal and proceed to question me about having a personality disorder.

I told her I just needed a phone call and the only thing I got was ""I'm busy, if it's bad just go to the hospital"" now I know this sounds awful but on that same night I think she had just found out her friend had committed suicide. Then shortly there after there was more shit that got worse for her.

I can't even get a hug from her because her past trauma is being making her uncomfortable. I haven't seen her genuinely smile for the past 2 months, the few times she will hug me they're short. I can't hold her hand either. I miss who she was, because this isnt the person I fell in love with and I want to help her get back where she was. I've asked her multiple times to go back to therapy, and if the insurance doesn't cover it I told her I would cover all of it. I just need her to get better.

Can't you find other better ways, let's say even original ones, to exploit such intense feelings for therapeutic purposes? it was what I was hoping for and even though it seems to have gone badly I think it didn't have to go that way.

"CW/TW: mentions of self harm, suicidal ideation

-

Obviously self harming behaviours can often be big part of BPD, but I didn‚Äôt realise just how badly I rely on it and how much I crave to do it, until more recently.

I was doing really, really bad a couple months ago and was actively self harming every day, and was very close to attempting suicide again. I‚Äôve slowly managed to get myself out of that pit and recently have been doing okay for the first time in a long time. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm happy because I‚Äôm not and I still get intense, depressing thoughts and feel down often; but my mood as a whole is more steady and I‚Äôm definitely doing better than I was. HOWEVER, no matter what, I still crave to hurt myself. I ache for it. I think about it all the time and want to do it. I feel compelled to. Especially when something goes wrong or if I feel a little low. I haven‚Äôt in just over a month because I am trying very hard for my partner who wants me to get better (he is very supportive and understanding, never mad if and when I did hurt myself - he only wants the best for me), and I thought it was meant to get easier overtime but it just gets harder. I need to feel that relief.

I said sure no problem, and sort of went about my day. I did a full clean of my house, took her for lunch, and then we watched Netflix and played ps5.

When we got into bed she just layed on her phone and watched tik tok. I started to try pulling her towards me to kiss her or caress her or something. She caught on and said ""do you need me to help you out"" which I do appreciate, but I was a little hurt because intimate time is something I'd like to share together instead of her just pleasing me.

Unfortunately this is a common occurrence, but last night hit me really hard for some reason. I think it's because she got my hopes up by saying she would be willing to fool around later, and then I was looking forward to it all day, and then I was brushed off again.

The frequency of this makes me feel like my girlfriend isn't sexually attracted to me and that she only gets me off to keep me happy. I do appreciate that, but I really crave the feeling of her desiring me. I want her to not be able to hold herself back, the same way I feel when I see her.

On the downside, nowadays my SH manifests as me punching my own face/body in fits of rage. Usually I am with my FP when this happens.

**Prompting Event:** There was a very painful interpersonal situation that occurred months ago that caused lots of falling out in a friend group that I distanced myself from. One past friend reached out to apologize (which is great), but it brought up other unresolved pain from this group falling out committed by another person that's gone ignored/unresolved. I reached out with a similar olive branch but there's no response and the ignoring behavior - while responding to the other person - has triggered a lot of rejection, dismissal, and pain. 

**My current state:** I was in DBT for awhile and have been 'recovered' for quite awhile.... I'm aware of many tips, and I know that part of coping is just moving through the tension and pain and remind myself it's not the end of the world.

and now, i cant stop thinking about it. they left this morning and i still am thinking about it. after the call they seemed fine, and they gave me attention. and nothing seems suspicious. but my brain keeps asking 'what if?' questions or skewing something they said or wondering if they have different meanings to what they say. why would they willingly call with their ex but dont enjoy calling me? do they text/call their ex regularly? do they text/call other people in general more than me? do they even like me???? 

i havent done anything about these thoughts, but it feels like im freaking out. do i say something? is my reaction justified? how do i stop freaking out lol?",bpd_disorder

"So I THINK, almost 90% sure that I have bpd, now I'm not self diagnosing or any of that but I've been searching up the symptoms and noticed I've been experiencing the symptoms for as long as around may 2021. There's always the possibility that I'm wrong and its something else that I've mistaken it for, but that's the main reason I want to talk to someone because I don't know wtf is going on.

I am scared to talk to one of the social workers at school, I have anxiety about it. In my head its like 

*What am i just supposed to go in her office and say I think i have bpd? or just not even mention that and tell her the symptoms that I'm experiencing. What if she thinks that I'm faking it? What if she just blows it off as ""oh your growing up so your body is going through a lot of changes this is normal""*

If it is true that I have bpd then this will pretty much be my only shot at getting the help that i need until next year when i go to a new school so I don't know what to do because i have a bad relationship with my mom, i don't feel comfortable telling her about what I've been experiencing because of the thoughts mentioned earlier and there is no one else that i trust or can talk to.

"(undiagnosed) When my emotions are at their highest (which is right now, hence this post, so apologies in advance bc I‚Äôm about to get inarticulate and rambly.), especially if I‚Äôm being called out for a shitty behaviour, it feels as if everyone around me is morally superior to me, and I am inherently flawed to the point of believing I am undeserving of anyone‚Äôs love, attention, or energy. It probably stems from the fact that I have never lasted in a friend group because if I am ever called out on anything (for example, cancelling too many plans, speaking without thinking, or even, in the case of living with people, politely told I haven‚Äôt cleaned something properly etc) I become overly apologetic, hyper-sensitive and self-sabotaging. 

Reminiscing about these friend groups is kinda painful for me, because I realise how many feelings I‚Äôve hurt, and how untrustworthy I am. It‚Äôs frustrating because I know that these kinds of confrontations, when dealt with maturely, are supposed to make friendships stronger. I think becoming a flailing emotional wreck whenever a friend initiates a simple confrontation with me tends to scare them off a bit, lol wonder why. I become an emotional wreck because once I fuck something up I convince I‚Äôm morally flawed and deserve to die, and whoever calls me out on it is an angel who could do no wrong. Like in my head I am a reprehensible, heinous, irredeemable devil creature and they are too nice and deserving of better friends to be wasting their energy on me.

I really struggle with separating memories from fantasies from dreams from ruminations and from desires. I worry that in retrospect I am less consumed with the thought dying and more interested in the idea of being dead ‚Äì rather not existing at all.


My biggest fear is that I will lose to my irrational self. There are times where I feel so removed from myself and my actions. I know I‚Äôm doing things but I cannot stop. My irrational mind find a way to justify it. Like it (‚Äúit‚Äù being my irrational mind) knows that if it moves faster it can win. There are times where I feel like I can rationalize anything. I can justify any action. During those irrational moments I feel so absolutely hopeless and desperate. 

I struggle so hard to use right words and say the right things. I‚Äôm trying to avoid manipulating people. I‚Äôm trying avoid people manipulating me. I‚Äôm trying to avoid being hospitalized. I‚Äôm trying to avoid be fired. I‚Äôm trying to make them like me. I‚Äôm trying to not ramble. I‚Äôm trying to not sound insane. 

Even writing these messages I feel surreal. I‚Äôm telling myself that I should not use suicidal ideation or thoughts to make people feel sorry for me. It‚Äôs manipulative. Despite having those feelings I shouldn‚Äôt share them. 

I feel like I have to remove myself from situations and interactions to avoid manipulating people. 

I think a large part of that is based on a lack of identity. Meaning that it feels so easy for me to become someone else. I feel compelled to absorb pieces of people and mimic them.

My biggest struggle I‚Äôve had in my life is dependency and abandonment issues with romantic relationships that I have.

It‚Äôs such a mess‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been trying to figure out if I have bpd or not and finally got to see a psychiatrist for a one time hour long appointment and by the end of it I was like ‚Äúokay so do you think I have bpd?‚Äù and she was like ‚ÄúI mean.. you have a lot of the symptoms of bpd but I don‚Äôt want to say that you have it; it has a lot of negative connotations (I forget exactly what she said but essentially she said something along the lines of I have a bit of control and self awareness over the symptoms to an extent, like it felt like since I‚Äôm not outwardly acting shitty, she doesn‚Äôt want to say I have it because it feels like she feels like diagnosing me is saying I‚Äôm not nice or something). Anyways so from that I‚Äôm still confused whether I have it or not because shes basically telling me I have it but she doesn‚Äôt want to put that label on me. 

This appointment was several months ago, maybe even a year ago now.

So basically i still struggle sometimes with getting over an ex. We dated for 3 years, it was a toxic relationship. 
He broke up with me, after 2 years we tried to pursue a relationship again because we both still had feelings for eachother, broke it off again and then after another 2 years we just casually hooked up for about 6 months before i met someone else who is now my current boyfriend and honestly the most beautiful soul i‚Äôve ever met.

But i just cant get my ex out of my head, it‚Äôs not necessarily that i miss him alot or still have deep feelings for him, well sometimes those deep feelings do come up when i see him somewhere or had a dream about him, but thinking of him became more like a routine.

Basically what i want to know is if anyone else can relate not fully getting over someone, i still think about him and sometimes i still cry about it even though its been like 5 years since we had the relationship and i dont think i will ever get over him for 100% but it annoys me and i feel quilty as well because this was the reason i never wanted to date someone else..",bpd_disorder
"Last year was incredibly hard for me. I'd just met somebody amazing but she went from being really into me to wanting to be friends, and as much as I tried to be ok with that I couldn't get over my feelings for her and I became really unstable and eventually we had to stop being friends for my own safety (I did not handle that very well at all and now we can't even talk, as much as I'd like to apologise. I hope she understands). Anyway, I had a tough time with that but I was in therapy and it was keeping my head just above water. Then one day for some reason I was feeling especially bad and my therapist was being really antagonistic about it, which led to me storming out of her office, going out and getting drunk, and attempting to take my own life at about 3am the next morning (2 days before Christmas).

I don't really remember it happening but one of my friends stopped me and we started looking after each other and went away for new year's together and she basically saved my life again because that trip helped me to feel more human. Over the course of this year we got a lot closer and tried to have a relationship. Now she's got her own problems mostly stemming from having been in abusive relationships and she'll sometimes lash out and not remember anything she's said and done. I keep trying to be compassionate but it triggers my bpd when someone accuses me of having ulterior motives or saying I've done things I haven't. I lose myself and can't figure out if what they're saying is true or if my memory of what happened is and so I haven't been able to give her the support she needed.

Just recently this all got too much and I'm at a point where I'm too afraid of how much being with me is hurting her and we tried to go back to being friends but she's not coping with that and now, once again, someone I care deeply about won't/can't talk to me. 

Obviously I see huge parallels with how she's been and how I've been in the past and I'm feeling awful about how I've made her feel, even though I know it's not really my fault. And it's also made me reassess a lot of how I've been in the past.

I'm really trying to get help and I keep getting turned down for the things that will help me and I just want to know if I should maybe just give up on trying to have relationships since they always end with both me and someone I love getting really fucked up by it.

"For background, I am 33 and just recently received my diagnosis. I have been in therapy on and off for other assorted mental health diagnoses since 2014.

Is anyone else married or in a long term relationship with their FP? My husband has been my FP probably since year one or two of our marriage, and that has come with all the things it implies. Everything for him is magnified, he gets my worst and my best, and I have thrown a lot at him over the years. Everything I'm reading seems to imply that FP relationships are inherently toxic or at a minimum difficult to manage, and I find it kind of confusing because my marriage is extremely compatible and happy.

To be transparent, my husband likely has a personality disorder as well and thrives off of care-giving and being needed and adored.

But how often have you been paranoid about something and it has not actually happened? I find this rarely happens to me and most of the time the paranoia was very valid. 

For example, you believe strongly that someone will abandon you and then it actually happens. Or you feel like a friend is lying with no proof then you find out they actually did.

He has one childhood female friend. He has known her for 10 years. The thing is, he's touchy with her the most out of all his friends. She is touchy too, she does that tk me too.

They also play fight literally whenever they see eachother and that has just crushed me.

I've told both of them my concern but they just reassured me that they're strictly platonic, they're both in relationships and tje reason theyre touchy is becauxw they know both of them are comfortable w it.

"So I (19F) have BPD. I have extreme mood swings and breakdowns and I am depressed almost all of the time. I only have a few days where I feel normal and motivated.

All of my close friends know about this, but they still think that I do it for attention.  Not all of them, but a good 60% of my friends think I'm acting ridiculous with my attachments and reactions to minor things. The thing is, I explained numerous times that I understand that I'm acting crazy, but it's out of my control. I do control myself not to hurt anyone, as I do get impulses to be mean quite often. But I cannot control my crying at everything and mental breakdowns.

I don't suffocate them with my illness, in fact, i barely talk about it at all. But they obviously notice my behaviour and think that I should get a grip on reality and ""just chill""

"The problem with mental illness is that it robs you of the solution to it, which makes your mental illness worse, which further robs you of it. 

So I've always had friends. My symptoms are mostly turned inwards which lead to many people combatting my diagnosis when I first got it. There was a small flare up last year which lead to me losing a lot of friends (which a lot of people in the group had done worse stuff and knowing that only made the flare up worse). 

I moved abroad and now I've came back to pretty much nobody. I sometimes go weeks without speaking to anyone. This has took my internalised BPD and very much pushed it external. 

Sadly the few people who I do still have in my life I'm becoming increasingly more critical and fixated on their actions as They're now all I have. Small things like them not messaging back or I didn't get invited somewhere just feels like they're pushing me away like everyone does... And while I never raise these issues or anything, they can definitely tell and it is pushing them away which is making everything worse. And my people pleasing is through the roof because I just want someone around me. 

It's also turned into social anxiety so Making friends has become harder than ever which makes me feel worse which makes my symptoms worse.

I've stopped having casual flings, despite being a social area I'm still good with. I stopped because I was getting jealous of these people I had a one night stand with. This was never a thing in the past and it's a side of myself I really don't like... This jealousy is in spite of me not wanting to take anything further with them because I know I'm not in the right frame of mind to hold anyone on the mantle of partner. 
But is cutting this out good, or is it just another social area I'm getting rid of and only going to make my symptoms worse?

I need to know how to make this better. Honestly other areas of my life, my hobbies, side projects and soon to be employment, are firing on all cylinders beso I think working on myself is all I really do, but it hasn't made me any more comfortable being alone. My attitude towards people is still decaying.

People say stop caring about what other people think and the friends will follow. But if my reasoning to stop caring what people think is for other people to like me, did I ever stop caring what people think?

"first off, i don‚Äòt like calling my fp my ""favourite person"", for me it stands for ""focused person"".

i have a heavy problem with switching between fps after the smallest triggers. my boyfriend that i‚Äòve been dating and living with for 1 1/2 years was my fp but i splitted on him the first time after a year and lost my focus on him. instead it switched over to a colleague of mine for a few months, i was literally obsessed and felt like i was cheating (i did NOT act on anything) because of it. I lost my focus on him when he was away for 3 weeks.

my real problem here is that i went from said colleague being my fp to it being my ex.
he cheated on me 2 years ago and i wasn‚Äòt happy in the relationship at all. so he kinda did me a favour and gave me a reason to dump him. i know all that. but recently i caught myself making up an old imaginary version of him that has no flaws and i connect all my positive memories to it. 
That was triggered by a heavy long lasting episode that i had because of my parents splitting up and me finding out that my ex has a new girlfriend. I enjoyed that he was still obsessed with me all these years and it damaged my ego seeing that he has someone new.
Honestly i only wish him the best, i don‚Äòt long after what we had but somehow i do. I want him to be happy but i keep thinking of what we could‚Äòve done better. He gave me the perfect amount of toxicity that my current bf doesn‚Äòt (luckily!!) but my self sabotaging ass somehow needs it to feel something.

I‚Äòm so used to the chaos that i can‚Äòt settle for a peaceful relationship. I‚Äòm fighting so hard against my own head every single minute so please don‚Äòt give me shit for this. I cannot control my emotions, obviously.
I love my boyfriend so much but i can‚Äòt share these feelings with him, so i just feel incredibly lonely with this.
I can still think rationally which makes this shit 10 times worse.

I wouldn‚Äòt share anything this personal on here if i wasn‚Äòt so desperate for someone who can at least tell me i‚Äòm not alone with all of this.",bpd_disorder
"Before I get into this, I‚Äôd like to put a content warning for all things body image, diet and ED related.

My issues with food began around age 12 and I‚Äôm now 22. I go through long periods of time where I get scared to eat, and I‚Äôm not sure why. The thought of eating just fills me with a paralysing dread. This is countered by times when I will stuff myself- to the point of feeling sick- with whatever crap I feel like eating. McDonalds, ice cream, sweets, sushi. Usually all in the same day or two. And then the fear returns. 

But here‚Äôs the thing: I don‚Äôt not eat because I want to be skinny. I hate being skinny, I‚Äôm currently 50kg at 5‚Äô2 and I don‚Äôt feel like a woman, heck I‚Äôm even more skinny than my teenage self. Which is why I have my eating days, why I force myself to consume and consume and consume till I can‚Äôt even move. Those days it will get so bad that I can‚Äôt even work properly, every hour I‚Äôll be dashing off to the staff room to eat a sandwich like it‚Äôs my last ever meal. It‚Äôs like a rush to get everything inside me cause I‚Äôm not sure when I‚Äôll allow myself to again. 

But right now I‚Äôm off my food, like a sick dog. The thought of preparing and eating a meal, or going out to eat just terrifies me. I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve it, what‚Äôs the point in eating if something bad is going to happen if I do. I should note that although I don‚Äôt feel guilt around food, when I feel guilt about other things (E.g. taking the day off work, disappointing my parents, how my body looks) I will have to be sick. It‚Äôs just such an overwhelming emotion that I have to let it out that way. I also hit my thighs and I will say out loud ‚Äúyou disgust me‚Äù when I see my body in the mirror.

My therapist suggested the gym, as that will make me naturally hungry at more regular times, but I‚Äôm too afraid to go. I judge my body so harshly I can‚Äôt be in a room of perfect people, who‚Äôll be looking at my weight and lack of experience and judging me for it. 

I‚Äôm really at a loss, I don‚Äôt think I have an ED cause I‚Äôm not focused on loosing weight but I know something in the way I am with food is not OK. Any advice appreciated, I‚Äôm hopefully going to be seeing my doctor next week.",bpd_disorder
"Hey! This will be a longish post but I need to get it out...  


I'm 26 and f and I've only recently been diagnosed with BPD and it's been a whirlwind few months trying to wrap my head around that diagnosis. I was admitted to an inpatient facility for 2 and a half weeks and was diagnosed with sensitivity ASD, ADHD, binge eating disorder, BPD and Bipolar. 

Just over 12 months ago my wife and I started trying to have a family and we fell pregnant the first try but unfortunately lost our angel at 8 weeks - we then went on to have another miscarriage 2 months later and that was when my entire world started to fall apart. I had a complete breakdown. 

Feeling so lost, out of touch with who I was, battling the grief I was drowning in I (now what I understand as) split. I split completely from the only person i've loved in 7 years. I stopped caring about her, about myself. I started to drink excessively and started to experiment with drugs (i've been anti drug my whole life, this was completely out of character). I broke up with my wife and started to give my affections to other people, people that didn't matter. We've been back together for 6 months but my mind and affection still wonders regardless of the deep feelings I have for her. She's my FP.   


I've been trying to find who I am, because all i've been for 7 years is my apart of this relationship where i've lost all sense of who I am, what I want and what I need. I've realised that I might be polyamorous...my wife however is not. I know that if I want to pursue that, she will no longer be in my life. Does anybody have the greatest fear that their FP will leave them but also have the need to be able to give more than one person love and affection in a different manner? It seems so contradicting to me and I can't work it out in my head.   


I'm unsure if this will make a lot of sense to anyone? It doesn't even make sense to me but any kind of input would be greatly appreciated :(",bpd_disorder
I have a gf. She had many sexual partners in past. My bpd makes me think that she is cheating on me. I am paranoid that she has someone. I always fight with her because I am so jealous.

I just need some advice on how to deal with this because I now have no job, back at my family home without a bed and had continuous episodes since. I know this is something people go through, but I‚Äôm not handling it well at all and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Does anyone have any advice or coping mechanisms please?

I have to wait a couple of hours or a few days to clear my head to finally understand what it actually is. At times, I don‚Äôt end up understanding what it is, and choose to just ignore the feeling. It‚Äôs hard coping doing this. Today I brought up something that my boyfriend did that upset me a few weeks ago; I decided to bring it up as it was nagging my brain from time to time. We didn‚Äôt fight, I just communicated what was done that upset me. He apologised and didn‚Äôt say anything else, we didn‚Äôt discuss it further. We just ended it at the apology. It makes me think that he probably thinks this is one of my other episodes, although I haven‚Äôt done anything impulsive, I only brought up the subject.

This happens every time. I shouldn't be surprised. But at 23, I find myself feeling like a loser again. 

The worst part is I don't even like these people. They literally only ever talk to me when they need something. I'm barely acknowledged here. And yet, being alone with not anyone to talk to here feels like the end of the world (I'm aware enough to know it's not).

"TW: Mention of self-harm, alcohol, weed, and abuse 




Hi, I'm so glad I found this community! 

Just a little background before I get into the good stuff. I was diagnosed during a stay in a Crisis Stabilization Unit (CSU) in February of 2021. I was struggling with a myriad of problems, the main problem being my recurrent suicidal thoughts/gestures. BUT that seems to have gotten better, now that I am no longer with my ex. 

So... the FP. I'll call him ""Clark"" for the purposes of this post. Clark and I met in Head Start. For those of you who may not know, Head Start is the equivalent of preschool for poor kids. Anyway, Clark also has CP. I took to him like glue, and we were inseparable during Head Start. The fact that he used a walker or crutches to get around didn't put me off at all. In fact, on days we got to play with the wagons, I'd push him around no problem. 

Clark and I remained friends until he moved away in second grade. When I found out he was moving away, I was devastated. It was the first time I had known true sadness. I remember it vividly. I was sitting with my papaw at his tool shop in the flea market. My mom ran into his mom, and she broke the news to me. I took it so hard. 

Clark and I met again sophomore year of high school. We had two or three classes together, and we just happened to sit by each other. We would casually talk about school stuff and all that, but eventually we would talk so much WE'D GET IN TROUBLE FOR TALKING AND GIGGLING. Y'all. We are both normally shy and timid people. We never got in trouble for talking in the past, either of us. 

Clark and I eventually exchanged email addresses and spent lots of time after school on yahoo messenger together. We'd watch Smallville (hence why I've dubbed him Clark for this post), and we'd exchange music video links for each other to watch. It was pure bliss. 

Junior year rolled around, and we lucked out. We had two classes together. We sat next to each other in both classes. However, not all was sunshine and rainbows. My mom was dating a man who lived four and a half hours away. My mom decided he was the one and that she wanted to get married and move away. I broke the news to Clark, and he grew distant from me. This broke my heart. By this point, it was obvious I had feelings for him. So I spent a lot of time crying, listening to sad music, and thinking about him. 

So mid-junior year, I moved away. We still talked occasionally on yahoo messenger but I still felt like he had kinda forgotten about me. 

Fast forward to college. I wasn't happy with the school I chose, because it turned out to be a party school. I wasn't about that, so I ended up transferring to the school where he was. For context, Clark and I started talking again while I was in college, and I confessed my feelings for him. He said he felt the same way. So my unhappiness with the school I was at AND the feelings factor played into my decision to transfer. 

So, I got to Clark's school, and he was partying hot and heavy. He decided he liked his freedom and didn't want to commit to anyone. So I moved on, and I ended up with my now-ex. 

I didn't talk to Clark much while I was dating my ex, who I'll call, ""Fred."" Fred was mentally and sexually abusive. I had an incident where I had self-harmed while drunk and drunk-texted Clark about it. Clark tried to console me and wasn't upset or mad or anything. But, in my brain, I assumed he would be and avoided him for over a year and a half. 

Then, one day, I got to thinking about Clark and decided to text him. He was happy to hear from me. We ended up talking somewhat more regularly after that. 

One night, I smoked weed for the first time with a good friend I made at work. My friend had fallen asleep, and I got a little bored. So, in my still-high state, I told Clark I loved him, with the clarification that it was in a platonic way. Clark said he loved me too... platonically. 

I wasn't always the best at keeping up communication with Clark. I was still with Fred, and it was always one incident after another with him. But when I was at the CSU, we were allowed to have our phones. And I'd call Clark every once in a while. 

Since then, Clark and I have talked almost every single day. And that was a year ago. I have feelings for Clark again, but I'm also wondering if it's a favorite person thing. Could it be both? 

Clark has already made it clear that he does not want a relationship with anyone. However, we have this long-distance FWB thing going on. It makes me wonder if he has feelings but just doesn't want to act on them because of the distance thing.

"my cousin with BPD passed away. she didn‚Äôt take her own life or overdose, but her ED and inability to take care of herself essentially caused her body to shut down. she was 26. she was sober and was working so hard to be a great aunt and person. 

we come from a very ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk about mental health‚Äù family, and although her parents were great support systems, i know (i also have bpd) the pressures of your other family judging you and the paranoia of them leaving you or disowning you because of your actions. 

her parents were the ones who introduced mine to each other. without them i would not be here. they were the only relatives we had in the area and she and her family were always people we looked up to. as i got older she became a mentor to me and the only family member i could talk to about bpd and substance abuse or really any unhealthy coping mechanism about. she was one of the main reason i stopped using and got my life together. i have suspicions that one of her siblings was sexually abusing her but obviously i can‚Äôt ask her now and would not bring it up to her family. 

all of my family says they find solitude in knowing she finally is at rest, and that she never had to struggle anymore. 

I understand where they‚Äôre coming from but it doesn‚Äôt sit right w me. i know she was suffering but she also was trying to stay sober and had made it to the point where she had reasons to stay alive and fight. i saw how she was healing herself and how much she cared about her family, especially her nephews.  she was staying clean to be a role model to them.

"I'm so tired of my partner invalidating me...which he has literally admitted to me he does do sometimes.

It's really upsetting feeling like I can't express myself and my human emotions without it being dismissed and blamed on just me being a crazy bitch with BPD whose splitting and has ONLY erratic and OTT emotions.

And it just isn't accurate at all. I don't know what to do its hard when you love someone and you're addicted to them to feel so invalidated. 

I can't find any videos online about this anytime I search bpd and invalidation it's always about how pwBPD invalidate their partners (cos ofc we're the bad guys right?!)...

"My best friend of many years has BPD. They are currently not in treatment. This week, they wrote me a text message and called several times in the middle of the night (I am three hours ahead since we're on opposite coasts, and my phone is in on do not disturb mode at night on a schedule, so I wasn't able to respond until the morning).

They had been on a trip with family who returned home before them and seemed very upset. I don't know if something happened between them, which perhaps triggered them. However, I became concerned because, in their messages to me, they described a situation happening that is 100% not possible (without going into detail). This makes me believe they may either have been under the influence of something when writing to me, lying (least likely I think since it was such an unlikely/unusually specific scenario) or experiencing some delusional thoughts.

I am not sure if I should say something or not. They seem better now, and I don't want to upset them or jeopardize that. I am bipolar and am biased because medication/therapy have been part of my life for years, but I do wish they would speak to a psychologist or psychiatrist. There was an incident earlier this year where they showed some signs of paranoia (which they realized on their own afterwards) and felt extremely embarrassed by it to the point where it triggered suicidal thoughts, which had never happened before. They don't share many, if any, specific details of their mental health with me, and I hate watching them suffer/not being able to support them in the way a professional would.",bpd_disorder

This is the very slimmed down version but i‚Äôm not sharing that to try and have you all see me as a victim.I want you to have the context before I tell you what i did. 

I had him blocked an all accounts but one(i forgot about it) and got triggered when i saw him like a picture i had posted. I‚Äôve been working on not burning bridges and trying to be the better person but he doesn‚Äôt deserve that. i don‚Äôt want him ever thinking that what he did was okay, although i know he always will because he‚Äôs a narcissist. 


anyway, i basically said stuff along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a cheating abusive asshole and have no right to like my pictures after what you put me through. stay the fuck away from me. you prey off young girls with money to fuel your addiction because you‚Äôre too lazy and incompetent to get a job. you tried to bring me to my worst and couldn‚Äôt because i‚Äôm stronger than you thought i was. don‚Äôt you dare to try to justify any of your actions with ‚Äúlove‚Äù because you only care about yourself. if i ever see you in public i guarantee i‚Äôll make sure everyone you‚Äôre with knows what a piece of abusive shit you are. if anyone you‚Äôve stole from presses charges i will be the first one to testify against you. even your friends think you‚Äôre a piece of shir. when we broke up they reached out to me and told me they were so happy that i was done with you. i want to wish the worst for you but you‚Äôre gonna end up dead or in jail in less than 5 years anyway so it‚Äôs not worth my time. at the end of the day, have a job, education and a future. stay the fuck away from me unless you want to me up in a ditch (that may have been too far) 

i honestly don‚Äôt think think me losing wasn‚Äôt warranted given all th stuff he put me and my family through, but am asking if i went too far? i know it‚Äôs not healthy to fight for with fire but it felt SO DQMN GOOD to stand up for myself after months of abuse. 


did i go to far? i also blocked him before he could respond because i didn‚Äôt care what he had to say and knew it would only lead to me sending more hate messages which as me setting a personal boundary (progress i guess lol)",bpd_disorder
"Was laying in bed and reflecting on my relationship with my boyfriend, who is also my FP and I know I won‚Äôt leave him, I love him too much but our relationship is so toxic and I needed some safe space to vent.

- Back in Feb 2020, he called off our relationship, lied to be about why it was ending. Said he was unhappy after a huge argument, very much triggered by my (then) undiagnosed BPD. He immediately started seeing another girl. Yet told me he wanted to focus on himself. 

- He cheated on said girl with me a few days after they started dating, which he hid from me as long as possible.

- went back and forth between me and this new girl for 4 months before they finally broke up and in nov 2020 we got back together.

- i go above and beyond for him, yet when I expect anything at all, I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs not right to have any expectations like an i love you before bed for example.

- If I ever being up how much I do for him and how little he does for me, he‚Äôll tell me things like ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt keep track,‚Äù and ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt do nice things for people expecting things in return.‚Äù

- when I have an issue with anything he sarcastically says he‚Äôll just start simping

- he constantly is on my as* about the say sh*t he does to me. But somehow it‚Äôs different when he does it. 

- If I have a negative feeling about anything he says/does he claims I‚Äôm in a mood and sums it up to my bpd. Making me wish I never told him about it.

- In our over 3 year history on and off, I‚Äôve only ever had a handful of apologizes

- He cheated on my with a GUY back in 2021, sexted a mutual friend and a few days later when I found out, said he didn‚Äôt wanna leave me because he loves me but said it was a test so he could know if he was into guys too.

- His friends/family do not know about us being exclusive, despite us always being together, he has just never straight up told them.

- After he cheated on me, I left all our group chats and stopped coming around his friends/family. When they asked about it he said it was his fault but he‚Äôll deal with it. I have been told that they through I was just having another one of my moments. So he cheated on me, and then allowed his friends/family believe I was just having one of my freakouts. It‚Äôs easier then 1- telling them about us and 2- owning up to what he did.

- I did something I didnMt wanna do for him. When I went along with it, and he didn‚Äôt like that I went along with it, I told him I did it for him and felt pressured. He pulled and extreme and equated it to if he came to me every day for a week and asked to ra*e me, on day 7 would I finally cave and say yes?‚Äô He constantly counters with extremes like this where he‚Äôll take a similar situation but it‚Äôll be so extreme that it‚Äôs very different. But because I can‚Äôt argue it, I have no way to win. 

- He gets annoyed when I don‚Äôt get him how I feel, but When I do, my feelings are often invalidated. If I tell him this he‚Äôll spin it and say me telling him that invalidates his opinion or he won‚Äôt address my feelings and remind me in 10 mins everything will be fine anyway so why deal with it.


Don‚Äôt get me wrong, he‚Äôs not a horrible boyfriend. I love him, but I do know he‚Äôs toxic as all hell with me. And guess I just wanted a safe space to vent before I fell asleep. No advice needed.",bpd_disorder
"TW - Intrusive Thoughts 

So yesterday one of my neighbours hammered on my door claiming my cat has scratched his car. A bit of background.. This guy has been a tosspot for a few years after his missus asked me if I drive a auto as at the time she was taking her driving test. I said yeah, I have enough anxiety in my life without clutches and gear sticks. 

That transpired as hey I cut myself (I do..) smash things and punch walls. Turns out on of my neighbours who I thought was friends told her my shit and she apparently was scared and told him that I threatened her. At which point I arrived home and he threatened to knock me out and all this shit..cling me a head case and a woman beater..like wtf. 

Fast forward to now. He hammers on my door saying he wants me to pay for a respray of his car because my cat scratched his car. 

So I said show my.. so I admit there was cat footprints on his car. There are 8 cats in this court between 8 houses so could be any one but he says he has videos and pictures it's mine. I asked to see them he said no. The scratches look more like he's brushed up the side of a tree or hedge. It looks nothing like cat claws and nowhere near the muddy cat prints. 

So he starts demanding money. At this point I'm getting passed off and tell him it ain't cat scratches it's from a hedge or branch. The scratches are on the front passenger upright of the windscreen...not really where a cat would scratch anyway. He's getting more aggressive saying he will 'sort me out' and 'deal with my cat accordingly' in other words kill her. At this point I said touch my cat and there would be trouble. He started acting all victim saying I was threatening him. At this point my mother and partner told me to come inside which I did. 

Came inside and my Mum decided to call 101 and got advice from the police. They laughed and said hand over no money and if he took it to civil court it would be laughed out. They are coming out today and going to have a word etc. 

Problem is I have been up all night super angry thinking of horrible ways to hurt him. When I went to sleep for a bit I had bad dream where I killed him. It's really bothering me. How the hell do I stop thinking about it and not feeing s angry. 

I'm so wound up about it all. Its completely taking over my thoughts to the point of obsessive.

The infection has since cleared but I never stopped. I ended up cutting tonight because I currently live with my mom and she doesn‚Äôt know I smoke cigarettes. I barely find relief from cutting anymore. I‚Äôve been self harming for 12 years and I feel so juvenile for still doing it. I see it as harm reduction from using drugs because my drug use was very dangerous (I would mix several depressants at once because I didn‚Äôt care whether I got high or just died, since then I‚Äôve been still abusing ‚Äúsafer‚Äù drugs that don‚Äôt show up on drug tests and I NEVER use when I‚Äôm at work and no where near as frequently), but my self harming is starting to go too far. I just hate my body so much. I see my value as only sexual because of my past sexual trauma. Because I don‚Äôt fit the societal standards of being the perfect sex object, I just want to destroy my body in anyway I can. Seeing pictures online of women with much better assets than me makes me feel like I‚Äôm nothing. This is gonna sound so fucking stupid, but there‚Äôs one specific picture that gets posted in various memes that triggers me so badly. It‚Äôs a picture of hot women in Denny‚Äôs uniforms, the reason why it triggers me so badly is because my FP (my bf) sent it to me and made a suggestive comment with it back in fucking January. I didn‚Äôt tell him how much it fucking broke me because I don‚Äôt wanna lose him. I feel worthless if I don‚Äôt have sex with him *at least* once a week and it‚Äôs been over 2 weeks. I post nudes of myself on NSFW subreddits just to get the sexual reassurance I feel like I‚Äôm lacking. I know this all sounds fucking ridiculous, typing it out is so embarrassing but I just need to get it off my chest. I‚Äôm self aware enough to know I‚Äôm just trying to make myself suffer, invalidating myself, and that feeding into my negative thoughts, but I just can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs just so much easier than working on my recovery, recovery is so much hard work and it‚Äôs very exhausting. I always say awareness is a curse without self control, and this is exactly why. I cringe at all of these behaviors and thoughts but I feel like I just can‚Äôt stop‚Ä¶",bpd_disorder
"i‚Äôm sorry in advance if this is disorganized, my mind is feeling really scrambled and i‚Äôm hurting a lot more than usual inside right now but‚Ä¶.

my fp just blocked my number and now i‚Äôm never going to speak to him again. i‚Äôve spent every single day for the past 2 weeks crying and trying to figure out what went wrong because we used to talk every single day, and we had been talking for 10 months now but until today he hadn‚Äôt responded to a text i sent him for 2 weeks exactly. last night i couldn‚Äôt sleep and i ended up sending him a really long text basically just detailing how him ghosting me really hurt my feelings and how it was immature and disrespectful of him to do that and that even if we‚Äôre just friends, you don‚Äôt treat friends like that because friends are supposed to be people you care for and he wasn‚Äôt treating me like someone he cared about. i also told him in this text that  something i struggle a lot with is feeling used and disposable to the people i care about because a lot of times it seems like they don‚Äôt care about me as much as i care about them. these feelings were exacerbated by the fact that right before he ghosted me, we had hooked up and he promised me before anything happened that he wasn‚Äôt using me and he genuinely cared about me but wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship because at the time we weren‚Äôt living in the same place but he is moving to where i live after summer.

so, basically: we‚Äôve been talking for 10 months, hooked up once in the past back in october of last year but i ghosted him after a few weeks because he started talking to me less and i was getting scared that he was going to leave me so i left him first and then about a week later i unblocked him and apologized profusely. we started talking again like normal and ended up hooking up again in april and then he ghosted me right after.

i found out tonight that he now has a girlfriend. i don‚Äôt know how long they‚Äôve been together for, but somehow in the last month since i‚Äôve seen him and he told me he cared about me but didn‚Äôt want to date until he moved down to where i live, he‚Äôs gotten a girlfriend. and it fucking HURTS. as soon as i saw them together on instagram i couldn‚Äôt control myself and immediately sent him a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù text and told him i wished he had the decency to be honest about what he wanted from me, and all i got out of him was 2 meaningless sentences and a blocked number. to add insult to injury i don‚Äôt even think he read my long text.

i‚Äôve calmed down a lot since it‚Äôs been about 2 hours since this all unfolded but i really dont fucking know what to do. even in the time when we weren‚Äôt talking i wanted nothing more than to talk to him and thought about him all the time and constantly was thinking of the times we were able to spend together in person and how much i still cared for and love him even though he wasn‚Äôt talking to me for whatever reason. now that i know why he stopped talking to me and seeing the fact that he didn‚Äôt give a shit about my feelings i‚Äôm going to be stuck in the loop of thinking about why i wasn‚Äôt good enough for him and trying to figure out why and where and when and how everything went wrong and i just don‚Äôt know what to do with myself without him‚Ä¶.

my friends just say i need to grieve and find the good in life which i understand and don‚Äôt blame them for saying but i don‚Äôt know how to feel any good when my life feels like it‚Äôs only temporary highs and permanent lows. if anyone has ever been in a situation like this or has any advice at all please please help me, i‚Äôm feeling so incredibly lost and alone right now.",bpd_disorder

Being split on is new to me( first time falling for women with bpd) but i can confirm it sucks and couldn‚Äôt have come at a worse time. Will I eventually hear from her again?

I want to be respectful of her feelings but at the same time leaving things like this doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. I‚Äôve put in a tremendous amount of time, energy and work adjusting and learning because I care for her deeply. And I‚Äôm sure she would say the same.

im just worried this will prevent me from creating relationships with new people. im going to college in the fall and just want to start fresh and have healthy relationships but my constant irritable nature is making me really paranoid i won‚Äôt be able to connect to people in the way.

"This mostly happened as a teenager but it makes me feel really guilty and suicidal to this day.

When I was newly 15 I invited this adult (said he was mid 20‚Äôs but who knows) that I met online to come over to my house, and I kind of knew he would prolly expect to hook up. When he got there I kinda panicked and didn‚Äôt want to do it but I didn‚Äôt feel like I had a choice now that he was here and came all the way from god only knows how far and now knows where I lived. I layed down and kinda just froze as he had sex with me. Never moved an inch. I was upset after felt disgusted with myself and cried in the shower. A while later still as a youngish teenager (16) I told  some of my closest friends and my boyfriend that I had been raped referring to this situation. I didn‚Äôt go into details about the situation though. Looking back I feel like a liar and an imposter can I call this rape? I feel extremely mixed feelings about it mostly guilt and shame for how I used it for attention from one‚Äôs close to me.

Later in life I have experienced more text book instances of SA but I still question and doubt myself probably because of my attention seeking actions as a teen.",bpd_disorder
"I've been diagnosed with borderline more times than I care to count...

I'm tired.  Really, really tired.  I used to try really hard.  I thought if I analyzed people's behavior I could discover the secret to ""normal"".  I could learn to read people and find people I can trust.

My family is gone.  They left when I came out as an incest survivor.  My mom is the only one left, but I don't trust her.  Bpd has ravaged that relationship beyond repair.  

I abandoned the job I went to college for to do customer service.  I abandoned that job, too and started a new one yesterday. 

The only thing I have is my boyfriend, who won't propose after 8 years.  I'm convinced he doesn't actually love me.  Except I'm logical enough to know that's the bpd, too.  

My therapist left the practice, yet another person to leave.  I have no friends, nobody except my boyfriend.  

I don't want to get out of bed.  I don't want to talk to people.  It's so stressful, so hard just to have a conversation with bpd.  It's like trying to read a script for a movie I haven't seen.  What are they thinking?  Do they hate me?  Will this person abandon me?  

The thought of going out into the world with all my paranoia, all my fear, all my attachment inappropriateness... It's exhausting.  Am I going to fawn over a stranger today?  Am I going to snap at someone who talked at the same time as me because I feel ignored?  Am I going to want to fight someone?  Do I have to smile and suppress while I feel all of this in 1 day so that my employer doesn't know what's happening?  

I'm so tired of living with this.  I don't really want to live, but what would people think if I didn't?  

I don't want to go outside.  I don't want to be seen or heard.  I don't want to text people back.  I don't want to go to work and say hello to strangers.  I don't want to pretend to listen to their small talk about the elevator moving slowly.  I don't want to have any interactions anymore because they all hurt.  

I'm so tired of bpd... I don't want to leave the house anymore.

"F22 here and I just can‚Äôt get past this wall of shame I‚Äôve been experiencing lately for my previous actions and idk how to move past it and feel better even though I‚Äôm trying v hard to act different in my current relationships.

I‚Äôve always been extremely obsessive over people in my past and it‚Äôs just flat out embarrassing. Most recently, hardcore professing how into this guy I was after he clearly was not showing interest. I sent him paragraphs on paragraphs just so embarrassing. 


Before that I was obsessed with this guy I was kind of hooking up with and like quadruple texted him made him playlists and everything when he would barely respond and clearly wasn‚Äôt into me like that. Things like this have happened on numerous occasions and looking back at how desperate and diluted i was and I feel trapped in a lot of shame about it.


Not only the obsessiveness over people but an obsession for attention from them, more so as a teenager just doing extremely attention seeking behaviors to get them to love me and pay attention to me. 


This has just been going on for so long what kinda triggered this shame spiral was reading old diaries and texts that just make me wanna cry of how much I devalued my self worth obsessing over people who don‚Äôt care about me.  I‚Äôm just so embarrassed and ashamed.

I work part time but if I ask for more hours they can give me upwards of 30. I live with my dad and he pays for everything except my personal expenses. so far I've saved most of my money. 

anyway, to get to the point. my aunt has completely lost it. she's a single mom of a one year old baby that is an active addict, convicted criminal, and generally a very violent person. she regularly steals from my grandma and has done so since she was a teenager. she is also diagnosed with schizophrenia and has done nothing to try to get help for it. she is about to lose custody of the baby and my grandma has a restraining order against her. if she loses custody the baby can either be adopted by my grandma, by my side of the family, or be put in the foster care system. My grandma is pretty old and honestly a pretty toxic person herself. she says that she probably won't be able to raise her full time. I'm worried about the baby growing up in the foster system and potentially be subject to mental and physical abuse and trauma. I'm not sure what to do. my dad isn't entirely opposed to adopting but says that I'll have to do most of the parenting.

"I just got dumped,

The person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with dumped me. It was more then a FP, it was more then delusional attachment. I completely genuinely loved him and wanted a family with him. It‚Äôs so easy to brush of us with BPD as being delusional, but I really mean it when I say I loved this man completely. 

It‚Äôs the love that happens once. I don‚Äôt doubt I‚Äôll love someone again in my life. But I‚Äôll always remember him. It will haunt me forever. 


We were long distance but closing the gap in literal weeks. We video called constantly. There was very good communication. I loved him completely. He said he did too. He put in literal hundreds for this trip, to see me. To close the gap. 


And it‚Äôs over now. 


He won‚Äôt give me a straight answer. He just cried and said he doesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with me. He cried like it was the worst punishment on earth. He told me he couldn‚Äôt get my old actions out of his head. Of times where I was delusional and erratic and suicidal. Something we had long since talked about. Something I‚Äôve been to therapy for, for over a year. 

I‚Äôm not lying when I said I‚Äôve been fine for Upwards of a year. NOTHING happened. It hurts so bad to learn my BPD caused this, when I got HELP for it. And I fixed it. But it wasn‚Äôt enough

What do you do when they say to communicate, and to fix. And I did that. And he said it was good. And he said he was happy with it. But it wasn‚Äôt. 


And so I did everything right and it‚Äôs over. And the trip I was about to take to see him is over. And the life we said we would build is over. And the man I loved with all my soul I‚Äôll never even get to touch physically. I‚Äôll never hold his hand. I‚Äôll never brush his hair and look into his eyes and tell him how much I love him


All over my BPD, for something that happened long ago. That haunts him. That destroyed my future. My disorder ruined my life again. Even when I did everything right.

"Hey! I wanted to post here to see if anyone has had similar experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

For some history, I have a diagnosed Panic disorder that I've had since I was a kid, and I'm a fairly anxious person but highly social. I have never been diagnosed with a mood or panic disorder. However, I have a partner now for about 7 months who is rapid cycling bipolar. They're medicated and have done a lot of therapy. Since being with someone who is well educated on mood/personality disorders and has been teaching me about their own, I'm starting to notice patterns in myself and my past that aren't normal. I've been struggling with coming to terms with it but I think there's a decent chance that I have BPD and I'm not sure where to begin.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fairly good at regulating my emotions and words as I have in the past had extremely angry lash outs that have ruined friendships/relationships and have forced me to grow as a person. I don't handle rejection well, usually sends me spiraling emotionally. I've never had a relationship last longer than 6 months as usually around this time conflict begins to arise and I'm completely incapable of dealing with it. I start to believe I'm being emotionally abused, I look for evidence of narcissism in the partner. Instead of addressing the core of conflict I find other reasons for it that have nothing to do with me. Sometimes I'm even well aware that that's what I'm doing. I know my thoughts are irrational but I have a very hard time getting them under control. I've fully convinced myself that my partner is secretly cheating on me or lying about things. I've done this with friends too, have fully accused them of lying to me about things that ended up being made up in my mind. I will say that these fears and thoughts aren't completely senseless as I've had a number of situations where I was treated quite poorly including an alcoholic step father and a much older than me partner with a drug problem in my early 20's - but at the same time, I should be able to compartmentalize and not believe everyone in my life is out to get me and ruin things for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I just want to know if anyone has dealt with these thoughts. So many people with BPD talk about having big lash outs which I don't really have anymore, but the thoughts I used to have before having them still exist. I  just don't externalize it like I used to. But being completely incapable of staying calm during conflict with friends/family/coworkers/and now my partner is going to ruin my life eventually. I emotionally can't function until it is fully resolved. If this isn't a trait of BPD can anyone point me in the right direction? And if it is, where do I begin and  how do I get help. I seriously can't handle the way my brain deals with conflict anymore. Every small bad thing that happens makes me feel like it's the end of the world. It's running me down emotionally and mentally and every connection is my life is unstable in a big way. Not sure where to begin.",bpd_disorder
"I swear every time I am away from my FP, it feels like withdrawal. 

We‚Äôre friends and not partners so as much as I wish I could, I cannot just spend every waking moment with him, but I say yes to every opportunity I can to be around him. Even something as small as going grocery shopping together after work feels like the world to me. I like his company so much that my fianc√©e says it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs my boyfriend. I confess there is a ring to it, if grossly inaccurate. 

The moment we part ways, it‚Äôs like a surge of emptiness fills me. How much I miss my FP and love him becomes all that‚Äôs on my mind. I do my best not to open his insta to get a look at his pretty face in order to pretend I‚Äôm near him. But I do find myself moaning to myself how much I miss him and love him. I want to curl up in a ball and cry until the next time I talk with him. 

The last thing I want to do is excise my FP from my life. He is incredibly fond of me, even if not in a romantic way. He‚Äôs the one who really jump started our friendship. He‚Äôs been a net positive in my own life encouraging me to finally pursue a career. Heck I‚Äôm even considering law school knowing how much he thinks I‚Äôm capable of. More than anything I just care for him and want to be there for him as much as it is appropriate to. I just don‚Äôt want to feel so much pain whoever I don‚Äôt have access to his attention.

i was just wondering if you all have the same problem as i do that i can't feel the love people give to me? like i can't process that people actually care about me and love me no matter how kind someone is to me.
i have loving people in my life who understand this disorder and who keep reassuring me, but no matter how much i get i can't feel it in my heart and it makes me feel so sad and constantly want more.
if someone important to me shows me a lot of kindness i feel very warm in the moment, and sometimes i can even process that i'm actually loved which gives me a lot of hope, but after usually just an hour or two it disappears and i go back to feeling that constant dread in my heart.
another big problem with it is that while i can't feel the love people give to me, i can still feel the love they give to others so i get very jealous sometimes for stupid reasons. i'm really scared that if i keep going like this then it'll get draining for the people in my life. does anyone know what to do about this? why i feel this way? or have any tips or ways to cope with it? or feel the same way? i also recently started going to therapy so i'm hoping that will help. i really hope all of you are doing alright, and let's do our best to fight this disorder.",bpd_disorder

Then back to me not being perfect and neither is she. 

However, I don‚Äôt believe I did any of these things, but that‚Äôs besides the point. I validated her feelings. 

She told me also that ‚Äòshe felt smothered by herself and me‚Äô‚Ä¶

What does that mean? 

I know she‚Äôs a fearful avoidant type of AS, I‚Äôm just so lost. 

I‚Äôm in NC for almost two months now, and I‚Äôm still stuck on that phrase. 

Any help explaining would be great :/",bpd_disorder
" So a month ago, I broke up with my very toxic ex. It was a very hard break up and even though I've taken big steps to getting over him, of course things are not completely cleared up in my head yet. 
  I met my new FP a few months ago playing online video games and we've technically become video game buddies by now. We even exchanged social media and we've been talking regularly (if not everyday). It's clear he likes me as a person and enjoys my company. And.. I know it sounds silly but.. I started noticing that I've become attached.. Sometimes he'll leave me on read and it hurts. If we don't text for a day I miss him. I'm trying to stop myself from getting any more attached but I feel like the only way is to stop playing/talking with him and I feel so bad and don't want to do that.... I catch myself romanticizing him and he actually is one of the most attractive people I've met , both physically and mentally. But it could never work like that between us cause he lives in an other country and is focusing on his studies, he even told me he is taking a break from dating etc and I respect that. 

  So yeah, anyone has any tips to not get further attached to this new person? It's really hard considering how attracted I am to him and my neediness for having someone care for me .. I catch myself making scenarios in my head that obviously will never happen and it hurts .. a lot. Idk if the feelings are amplified because of my break up or what. But I was attracted to him even before I broke up with my ex. (But I obviously didn't act on them)",bpd_disorder
"Hi, I've had a fairly odd/unique life thus far. I was 300lbs in school and didn't have a lot of friends [0 I spoke to outside of school], dropped out in gr 10 [bullying/social anxiety] and now we're here. I'm 21, not 300lbs and would like to make friends. I do not have a single friend and have never done any activity outside of my house without my family. My family is another story in of itself. My father took his own life in prison when I was 2, my mother traded me to my abusive great-grandmother for drugs/alcohol money and I resided with my abusive grandmother from age 6-16 [where another source of abuse/neglect came from. I was not spoken to and not cherished/cared for. I had all the things to survive food, clothes, housing but never once heard ""I love you"", or spoke to anyone about school or spoke to them about anything other than logistics. Also the woman who abused/neglected me was abused in a residential school. I don't blame her but obviously would've liked things to go differently. At age 16 my non-abusive and most important person in my life came about, my grandmother who has since loved, cared and provided for me and given me unconditional love in a way I did not feel as a child.  

Questions : 

**For people who have gone through DBT/medications , which would you suggest first? And, has the therapy corrected thought patterns or are you simply coping with a strategy of thought? [stoicism etc] I am 21 and male.**

**I am not diagnosed but figure I am probably BPD [symptoms link-up and the cause] I apologize if I offend anyone by claiming to be without a diagnosis*

I should also mention that during the time I resided with my abusive grandmother I did nothing but play video games from age 6-16 as a coping mechanism/escapism, I also used food to cope with anxiety. Nowadays I've adopted healthier coping mechanisms such as : Morning runs, working out and smoking weed.

"So I (21 M) know this girl(21 F) . I've known her for a very long time (went to school together), we've been good friends for fairly long. Now she has been in a 3-year relationship with this guy, they cheated on each other more than once yet somehow always stayed together. She always wanted to leave him but couldn't. Eventually I told her that I was attracted to her and knew that she was too, but I wouldn't want to start anything with her til she was still with this guy. After some weeks she tells me that they're breaking up, and after a bit more we start seeing each other regularly and having sex. The relationship went good for about five months, and I could tell she was into me and was having a good time too. Then one day she tells me that she's going to visit her cousins for the weekend, and when she returns she starts acting suspicious, so I ask her what's going on but she wouldn't tell me. After a long on and off she finally tells me that she didn't go see her cousins, but her ex. Now it's been three weeks since we haven't heard from each other anymore. I'm still surprised that she did what she did and why. Now I know that this might seem like me trying to give myself an answer to that and me just being delusional, but lately I started to inform myself on BPD and although I've just scratched the surface, I recognized a lot of patterns and behaviors that match up to hers. Especially regarding relationships. As soon as I started mentioning the idea of us being a couple, she started to freak out, yet she was the one who had always been more attached and seeming to want commitment. The fact that she can't get out of the relationship with her ex, the fact of her pushing away me, one of her few friends that she has left. A lot of thing add up. And I guarantee that there is a bunch of other stuff that matches up too. Now what she did is unforgivable, but I feel like if she actually has BPD things would be different and I'd still want her to be part of my life, 'cause I wouldn't want to be another person that she pushes away from herself. I know that she went in the past to a psychologist, but for a short time. It could even be that she was diagnosed but didn't tell anyone. I don't know if I should tell her about it or just let it be. Again I am not 100% certain. The thing is, I don't even know if it would be good for her to know that she has it. But I kinda want to intervene because I know that she's suffering now and she doesn't want to lose me either. What would you do? Assuming she has BPD, do you think she needs to know or is it better to just let things be? I hope I didn't offend anyone, I'm new to all this.",bpd_disorder
"This is my first or second post on this subreddit so i‚Äôm sorry if i don‚Äôt follow some of the customs here but i felt like i needed to talk about this. 

Im genuinely the most refreshed and happy I‚Äôve been in months. Recently our relationship had been getting extremely stressful because of personal issues and big decisions about our futures that we have to make. It was really bad and it got to the point where we were getting into arguments almost daily that would send us both into really bad spirals. Our relationship was toxic and manipulative and we were terrible to each other even though we wanted the best for each other. Both me and my gf have been diagnosed with BPD and our mental illnesses/issues have had a huge impact on the relationship as a whole. 

Yesterday, we were at the breaking point of a hopeless argument that lasted for 2 days. After a final conversation we broke up (for the 5th time). Today she texts me after asking if we can talk and she‚Äôs talking like it‚Äôs the first time we‚Äôve talked before. It felt really nice and I went along with it. We introduced ourselves and talked about random things for a while until we decided to meet up later today. We met at a coffee shop and started talking about relationships. We referred to each other in the past as our exes and it let us open up about the things we did wrong in our past relationship. She talked about how she felt that we moved way too fast and it set up a bad foundation for our relationship and I talked about how I felt that we should take time to get to know each other better so we can see each other for who we are and not a fabricated version (we both made each other our favorite persons). Everything was really non-judge mental and honestly really cute, all the while talking as if it was our first date. It was funny and cute and refreshing to have a fresh start for both of us. 

Later tonight we watched netflix on netflixparty and we set a time to stop watching and go to sleep and we actually followed it :). 

I don‚Äôt know if this is going to help anyone but I would highly recommend starting over with the same person. A lot of relationships with BPD are ruined because of these built up problems that never seem to go away. Starting from scratch is a nice way to help with this. Take a second to reflect, and then talk to your partner like you‚Äôre just meeting them. Go on a first date. Now we know what we did wrong the first time and we won‚Äôt let it happen again. I cant speak like i‚Äôm a voice of authority because i‚Äôve ruined a more than couple relationships before because of my constant spirals and unrealistic expectations resulting from BPD, but I feel like this is a nice way to help with some of the problems BPD creates in your relationships. 

I hope this helps someone/a couple struggling from something similar, or at least lets people see that there‚Äôs hope for even the most messy relationships.",bpd_disorder
"I need some perspective on how much contact people have with those that they identify as their FP, and who are not romantic partners. Mine is my best friend, and I struggle a lot with wanting their company all the time. I know that is not reasonable, but I'm wondering what is reasonable. If I had it my way, I'd talk to them on the phone every day and see them a few times a week. There was a brief period when I was seeing them multiple times a week because they were going through something, but once they felt better, they didn't want to hang out as much. I loved that brief moment of time.  I might have unrealistic expectations and do not want to cause added stress to them by asking to see them more often.",bpd_disorder

"I don‚Äôt want to self diagnose, but everything that I read online makes me believe more and more that I do in fact have bpd. I‚Äôve taken online tests which I know aren‚Äôt completely accurate but i always get that it‚Äôs highly likely and contact a therapist immediately. I have read article after article, each time i cry because i have never been able to put into words the way I feel and the way my brain works and these articles describe myself so accurately. I struggle with regulating my emotions, control, anger, self loathing, self isolation, emotional outbursts, and the list goes on. From the time I can remember I‚Äôve been like this but I always keep it to myself because I thought my feelings weren‚Äôt valid. I was often told by my family that I‚Äôm dramatic overly sensitive and that I overreact. I used to throw things at the floor and rip up papers, kick the wall, and self harm (such as hitting, scratching, biting, and worse) I was in 5th grade the first time I can remember doing some of these things. I never did this in front of anyone, including family. I cried myself to sleep most nights, feeling like I was crazy and I always felt like if I was ever honest about my thoughts I would be locked away. I want to get diagnosed but my family is taking me off our insurance and I can‚Äôt afford it. I saw a therapist for a few months but it didn‚Äôt work out bc she said something that completely wrecked me and made me doubt myself.

"I recently came to the conclusion that when it comes to BPD in my case is that I cannot truly love someone because deep down I don‚Äôt care for or about them and I really never did. That information hits me like a ton of bricks when I don‚Äôt have access to that emotion or feeling in my brain. I split, literally everyday. I do my very best to cover it up and make sure nobody knows my invasive thoughts. It kind of takes over sometimes and then I realize how I‚Äôm a child who has somehow ended up in an adult‚Äôs body.

When I go throughout my day I don‚Äôt really care about anything. I want to mention in advance that I have huge identity disturbance hence why my room is bland and plain-looking with no furniture or decorations, my clothes is random stuff of every colour yet I wear mainly black, I don‚Äôt have preferences, have a hard time with favourites, likes &amp; dislikes and interests and essentially have no life plan or purpose.

I smoke weed to make sure I don‚Äôt get panic attacks from triggers combined with overthinking when I‚Äôm sober. My mind legit goes insane. It‚Äôs the only way I can function without the extra thoughts, sleep better too. But then times goes much faster and you don‚Äôt realize how much you have spent it doing absolutely nothing but browsing the internet and typing up things like this.

My brain goes at a million miles a second and I feel so shitty when I‚Äôm unproductive yet not able to control anything about it. It feels like hell. And some days are euphoric where I‚Äôm the narcissist on the stage, nobody is in my way and I only live for myself today. Though we know how that goes, moods change throughout the day. When someone asks me, ‚Äú*how are you doing?*‚Äù I have to really think about it because overall, I have no idea. My black and white thinking goes to that extent. Sometimes I sweat so much for no reason as a result of anxiety, at times it‚Äôs social while depressive thoughts too surround me every morning, afternoon, evening and night. Everyday simple, basic tasks have always been difficult to maintain with so much going on at once.

"Hello, 
Just looking for some feedback on this question. I was wondering how most of you approach this topic. I've found, if i tell people early on, they'll then associated any negative experience with me to my BPD. Or they'll use that as an excuse for their actions that may have bothered me. It takes away our validity in a sense. I sometimes hate telling people because then they start assuming things about me/ other people with BPD. 

So, do you tell your coworkers? Casual friends? Acquaintances? It kind of gets passed along anyways. 

All advice appreciated. Thanks!",bpd_disorder
"So, I mean fragmented as in noticing the roles each part of your mind and personality plays in your daily life. When I was young all I could se was the borderline self, I was borderline in my entirety, my existence was a borderline existence. Now, 12 years after my diagnosis, after many different therapists, psychiatrists and medications, after 12-step groups (SLAA) and lots of reading I moved to the quieter side and can finally see that borderline is a part of me instead of describing who I am. 

There‚Äôs the critic voice that shames and shuns me whenever I slip up, there‚Äôs the borderline voice that craves trouble and instability, theres the child voice that‚Äôs completely frightened and there‚Äôs *me* the mediator who just wants to live a nice life, make progress in my dream carreer, enjoy their family and make friends.

After I started DBT I felt that my inner dialogue was more evident and as I made progress I seemed to negotiate with these ‚Äúparts‚Äù better. Whenever I sense the borderline side is craving messed up situations I can explain to myself that‚Äôs utter bullsh*t and will only lead to negative results. There are times I‚Äôm not that able to work things out and I do happen to have an episode (which I think is 99% related to the child self that‚Äôs terrified of abandonment and thinks that the world is plain evil). The critic side, as a result of decades of internalized shame, is still quite loud in my head.

"He portrays the idealized version of himself I fell for. Meanwhile I have the knowledge that he's a highly manipulative porn addict with narcisstic traits. I suggested therapy but he claimed he couldn't wrap his mind around it. He can wrap his mind around jacking off multiple times a day and donating sperm to dozens of strangers off an app similsr to tinder, but not going to therapy?

I'm sad and depressed from seeing him portray the idealized version of himself I fell in love with. Marketing himself to unsuspecting women as someone who wants a relationship but he doesn't want a relationship, he wants to manipulate and concer women. He has a revolving door of temporary relationships because hes not capable of a healthy one.

He's probably had several girlfriends and done another dozen sperm donations. Meanwhile I'm depressed and haven't gotten remotely close to anybody like I was with.

I want to clarify, as I know its a frequently a debated topic in this group thing. He has narcisstic traits, obviously I'm not qualified to diagnose him. He's manipulative, portrays himself to the outside world as someone completely different from who he is. He gaslighted me, he made me feel like I was losing my mind. He idealized and discarded me like garbage. I suggested he go to therapy but he said he couldn't wrap his mind around it. So he's not seeking treatment, he's not self aware, he's not working on himself. I note these facts as there often what I sight as evidence that while I was diagnosed with BPD I made genuine efforts to seek help and better myself, as any responsible person should.

But her love comes with a lot of conditions. Like I should marry the one she decides, etc., So there's no use expecting love from family. 

It's insane how I could keep pouring love for people who do the bare minimum. All the people I've loved at some point told me I deserve more than what they could offer. And that's 100% true. I give a hell lot cause idk when to stop giving. The only way for me to stop is when I give too much for too long and I get hurt too bad as a payback for all the love I gave. 

Ik it's not normal how much I could love someone. How much I'm willing to do and risk for the bare minimum. And ik that I should put myself as my first priority. It's not like I'm haven't tried it. I just want someone to not abandon me. To sit with me on my low days. And to give me random hugs without me having to ask them. Is it too much to ask for? People make me feel like it's my fault. It's my fault that I want love. I should love myself. But idk how to love myself until someone else does.

"

I (13F) struggle with self harm and recently got diagnosed with BPD, however, I don‚Äôt want to stop self harming, at all. She told my mother to lock up all the sharps and my mom already did, so my psychiatrist asked how i was still self harming, and my mom told her that i had some stuff hidden away.

My psychiatrist proceeded to tell me to either tell my mom where it was so she could confiscate it or have to lose my privacy and be under supervision.

There are tons of opportunities where i could self harm, when i'm changing, showering, at school. If i REALLY had to have supervision any time i could self harm, i would have to be watched in the bathroom, changing, etc OR have my body checked afterwards.

My mother knows i would lose it if i lost my privacy, especially since we (my mother (58F), my brother (18M), &amp; his gf who stays over almost every night (17F) as well as my moms boyfriend (67M).) live in a one bedroom duplex. I have to sleep in the living room with my brother and his girlfriend, while they take my bed and im on the couch, when her bf comes over. 

Not having privacy is whats has me on edge and going on a downwards spiral. Ive never been suicidal and rarely get angry, but in the past 2 weeks, Ive found myself wanting kill myself AS WELL as hurt someone else because of anger.

At this point, i honestly just want to feel better in anyway. I don't care if its a bad coping mechanism or a good one, i just want this shit to end. Drugs, suicide, sex, ANYTHING. 

I feel like i need to be in a mental hospital, and i wouldn't be opposed to going, but unless i am currently trying to kill myself, which i'm too much of a pussy to do, we have to pay for my stay there.

Either way, if i told my psychiatrist i felt i needed to go, i feel like she would just say i don't need too, and i would feel like i'm overreacting and wanting attention and i'm not that fucked in the head.

My mom was wanting to send me to a hospital anyways, but then again, we'd probably have to pay, and considering were basically 5 people living in a one bedroom duplex, we CLEARLY don't have money for it.

I have no one to tell this to, so i'll speak to the internet ig. I can't talk to anyone, not even my family or friends. I just can't. I don't know what to do.

"Trigger warnings for mentions of rape, suicide, miscarriage, drug and alcohol. Ive tried to keep it as brief and vague as pos.

This post is going to be rambly and a bit all over the place, so sorry in advance. Also sorry for the grammar and spelling errors. I‚Äôm looking for advice and guidance please.

Hi, I was diagnosed with bpd 3 years ago. Theres been a lot of trauma in throughout my life, and the past year or so I finally started to feel more stable which was ace. Until recently, i cant pinpoint when things started slipping up again but today theres been a kind of explosion of all my built up emotions and I took it out on someone who didn‚Äôt deserve it at all. 

I‚Äôm not trying to justify my actions but i think a bit of background would be useful. Growing up i was an awful child, i was always angry and i never knew why but used to have physical outburst at my parents. It was only towards them, and I don‚Äôt know why it was at them and why i was ‚Äògood‚Äô around others. I never wanted to hurt them but i couldn‚Äôt stop. This lead to me eventually going into foster care as my parents couldn‚Äôt cope but it also wasn‚Äôt a healthy environment for my siblings. I don‚Äôt blame them for that decision. It still hurt. Now looking back i can see how incredibly damaging i was to their mental health, but i still cant help but feel hurt. A lot of their time was taken up with my outbursts, and i never got any quality time with them as a result, the rest of their time was spent with my siblings. Rationally i know they spent time with me because of my outburst, but it annoys me because i didn‚Äôt get that quality time like my siblings. Its frustrating as i know rationally that was okay, but the other part of my brain has always told me they don‚Äôt like you, they didn‚Äôt want you thats why you got sent away, they only speak to you cause they feel bad. The rational side of my brain is constantly at battle with the other side of my brain and its draining. How do you get it to stop?

In foster care, i got in with the wrong crowd- drugs, alcohol, unhealthy relationships ect. I was also moved foster placements over 15 times as i was too much for people to handle. I had ‚Äòfriends‚Äô use me and steal from me, and then death threats when i called them out on it. I was raped by another foster kid who at the time i was in a relationship with. Has a miscarriage. I had episodes of psychosis from drug abuse. I ended up in and out of psych wards too for attempts. In one of the hospitals a close friend committed on the ward. In one of my foster placements i was neglected, and there was an investigation into ss which found multiple failings. This isnt for sympathy. I have felt so done over by people. I blame myself alot, like if i could control my anger i would have still been at home and none of that would have happened, or if i kept my head down and stayed away from the drugs and alcohol alot could have been avoided ect. 

But i also see the bad in everyone. I think everyone is out to get me. Or how long before that friend wants to hurt me. Or how long before that family member decided to cut me me off.

I have such a fear of being hurt by people that I struggle to go out alone. I go on walks by myself to areas where theres not people, but everywhere else i have a carer which is usually my mum.  I moved county to get away from all the stuff from where i used to live and to be close to my mum for support. For a while that was going great. But then she started to take a step back because she couldn‚Äôt commit to helping anymore. It annoyed me as i moved the the county she was in aa she said shed support me and it seemed to have all been for nothing. I could‚Äôve moved to a few other county‚Äôs where other friends and family had offered to support. It took me back to the feelings i had when i was a child of being too much and unwanted. I kept it to myself for a while, but we were arguing more and more over the smallest of things. Until today when we had another argument, and she said she wasn‚Äôt going to the concert i brought us tickets for and to ask my dad. I was so hurt, the kind of hurt where u can feel it in every fibre of your body. I went to hers to try and talk, and i know I shouldn‚Äôt of. She asked me to leave, and thats she didn‚Äôt want to talk. Every rejection felt like another knife pushed into me and twisted. I wanted her to know how i felt and i knew shed be annoyed if i didn‚Äôt leave and thats the closest shed get to hurting like i was. She said if i didn‚Äôt leave we were done. As i was sat refusing to leave i was thinking to myself just go home, this is going to make things worse,why do you want her to hurt? Your sick. But i couldn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt explain why. She said if i go we will talk on Friday as i said if i leave theres no point as you wont speak to me anyway. She drives me home but then I‚Äôm thinking she just said that to lake me leave. Its like im a shell and im being controlled like a puppet. Im refusing to leave the car again. Eventually i leave, but again i don‚Äôt know why i left, just like i don‚Äôt know why i refused to leave. I remember everything, but its like it wasn‚Äôt me.

My anger, my distrust, my feelings of rejection are starting to rule my life again. I had this under control for so long but its like a screw has come loose and now everything is back to how it was when i was younger. I don‚Äôt want to be like this. So i guess I‚Äôm asking for help on how to stop all of this again. I currently have a referral for the mh team in place, but i need something sort term for now.",bpd_disorder

"Hi all,

I'm used to relationships ending badly, and my exes always eventually resenting my abandonment issues and using them to utterly crush my self-esteem. My last ex told me that I had insatiable needs that no girl would ever be able to handle. 

Recently I figured out that I actually have so much trouble communicating my needs; I let them convince me that I'm the one who's overreacting and that I have to deal with this myself. ""You're not a child anymore but an adult!"" Basically, my partners are always emotionally distant and make me feel that there's no place at all for my issues. So I'm really having trouble with the question of how much support I may ask for from my partner.

And also: the less support they're willing to give me, the more abandoned I feel..

Today I had the following thought: I'm allowed to ask for however much support I need, but they're also allowed to leave. Like let's say I would want to cuddle for 3 hours every day. Of course that would be insane much, but if there's someone willing to give that to me, then that doesn't matter anymore right?",bpd_disorder
"Because I've been in abusive relationships in the past, I no longer can tell what's a reasonable request from others. I usually am a people pleaser and agree to all terms of a relationship in order to avoid abandonment. 

I am sad to say that a friend has become my FP and it's been very crippling for me. They know all about this, and vowed to stick by me and reassure me. They've been doing this for the past year for me, but they now have a new boyfriend. They haven't been available to see me, talk on the phone, or even to text for over a week. When I communicated my sadness about this, they stated that when they are with their new boyfriend, they won't be able to communicate with me because it is rude to him (although when they are with me, they communicate with him all the time). This is reasonable to me, but the part that's re-traumatizing me is that her new boyfriend refuses to leave, so it's been over a week of little to no contact from my FP. And this will happen at least once a month now of little to no contact for whenever he is around. It really only takes a few seconds to respond to an ""I miss you"" text, but even that's too much now. I'd like perspective on this, because I have none and am getting more and more triggered. I am sad because they know all about my abandonment issues, and they seem minimized now. Help.",bpd_disorder
"My life when I‚Äôm dating someone is basically 40% alone time and then 60% time with my FP (who is usually my boyfriend). I usually like to spend time with my FP not in public but in private where we can chill out.

If I‚Äôm not dating someone I usually am like alone 80% of the time and then 20% with family. Rarely I will go out with old friends. My sister pointed out that I don‚Äôt spend much time with my family and I agreed. I don‚Äôt know why but I find time with my family and friends to be draining. It could be because my family doesn‚Äôt really like to do things that I like to and typically they go out in public which actually drains me. 

When I‚Äôm with others, I can‚Äôt help but think of things I want to do when I‚Äôm alone. My most recent FP/now ex had nothing in common with me in terms of things we liked to watch so I‚Äôd even have these thoughts with him when I‚Äôd be scrolling Netflix and find something I‚Äôd like but he wouldn‚Äôt. I would have these moments where I‚Äôd crave independence or alone time from my FP but I‚Äôm still a cranky and insecure mess when they leave (mindfulness issue ik). But the point still stands that my FP is the only person I wanna hang out with, otherwise I just want to be alone. Thinking of how I naturally prefer this makes me realize how easy it‚Äôd be to fall into an abusive relationship where I‚Äôm ‚Äúcut off‚Äù from others‚Äîwhich is something my own family has said that they‚Äôre scared of for me.

Apologies if this is common knowledge. I am still going through the diagnosis process and am in DBT therapy. I have other diagnoses of depression and anxiety, as well as social anxiety.",bpd_disorder

"Recently, my friend mentioned she thinks she has BPD. A lot of her actions align with symptoms, and I want her to reach out for help.

A difficulty at the moment is that she is in a codependent relationship (by her own admission). Right now they are stable, but for months until recently she was deeply upset, as her long term bf had been really shitty towards her. Things like emotional infidelity, telling her he hates her, laughing at her expressing her feelings. At one point she was serious about leaving him. I think a lot of her self esteem and happiness comes from whether her relationship is stable.

I really think that because she feels happy in her relationship and therefore happy with herself now, she‚Äôs dismissing how she felt then. I asked if she had called someone to discuss BPD, following on from the conversation about it that we had last month. She said she doesn‚Äôt feel she needs to because she feels good right now. I strongly think she should, as I don‚Äôt think how she feels now will last. I care about her a lot and don‚Äôt want to see her so distraught again. So I‚Äôm going to have another conversation and really encourage her to reach out.

Does anyone have any guidance on how best to approach this? I like to think I am emotionally intelligent but I can always learn more about BPD. I will speak to her with care, reassure her that I‚Äôm not upset with her and show that I only want the best for her. I will also listen and stay patient, but ultimately I really want her to get help and may have to be persistent with my encouragement. I‚Äôm not sure if this will be helpful though.

My friend is a wonderful human being who I am so grateful to have met.

I hope everyone reading this too realises they are good enough and capable of living amazing lives, even if it doesn‚Äôt always feel like it.",bpd_disorder

"Up to this day I‚Äôm kinda confused why my friend was ignored by a wedding he got invited to. He was very close to the bride prior to the wedding (they were colleagues and he was her supervisor of some sort).

This two literally text daily, it made me wonder how her fianc√©e was taking it because the texts would go from morning like the moment she wakes up and can last up to 8 to 10 so it appears neither one has boundaries when it comes to texts or they don‚Äôt feel there needs to be one. So the closeness started September last year and is still ongoing now.

The wedding happened a few days ago and I was stunned that her first reaction to seeing him (while she was standing beside her groom in her dress) was ‚Äúoh hey I didn‚Äôt recognize you with the glasses‚Äù. That was about it.. I thought that was strange and my friend looked a little confused too. Bride didn‚Äôt introduce him to the groom despite my friend saying he wants to us dinner with them..that kinda thing makes me think they were close but at the wedding the bride seemed like she didn‚Äôt want to be associated with my friend. 

My friend didn‚Äôt grow up rich and so he brought me there as his plus one saying ‚Äúyou have the upbringing to help me navigate their social class‚Äù. It was a very upper crust group (like old money) and even for me it was a hard table to work on. I had to pull every card I had lol.

We had to ambush her during a photo session just so he can introduce me to her. She gave me a hug and told us ‚Äúsorry guys I have to check with the other guests .‚Äù 

At the reception I was already drunk and having fun with my steak. Bride never looked at us anymore after the intro at the photo session.

The entire night he was texting her like how he usually does when he‚Äôs at home. I felt kinda sad for him. He was also lost on what topics to talk about and ended up talking about gophers, which is really not something you talk about during these events.

Anyway it seemed like she was literally avoiding us (facing the other way sometimes) I also saw her look at me and she never asked how I was or that she was happy to meet me. Nothing.

The wedding was kinda expensive so it didn‚Äôt make sense why she ignored us. We had to go home without saying goodbye. My friend never met the husband.

My friend posted on his Facebook wall pics of the wedding and tagged the bride and groom. She responded like how she usually does, and if I‚Äôm not mistaken they are carrying on and texting as usual now she‚Äôs married and on her honeymoon (lol).

What gives? I‚Äôm confused at this. I go to a lot of weddings (this is my friends second wedding invite, he‚Äôs not a popular guy). 

Thoughts? Please don‚Äôt be mean thank you :) üôè

"so I've been sober of all substances for a few weeks now, and having extremely vivid dreams is typically part of the withdrawal process. But damn, I was NOT expecting this.

I used to have this recurring dream of my mom yelling at me, shaming me, ignoring me, etc as I try desperately to explain to her that she/something has really hurt me or that I'm emotionally not okay. usually it starts with her doing something terrible to me and then dismissing it. then it builds and builds until I'm SCREAMING at the top of my lungs and hysterically crying (or, sometimes, trying with all of my strength to scream but nothing will come out). Sometimes, I become totally deranged and start to get physically violent in these dreams.

since I've been taking a substance break these dreams have come back but they're now about EVERYONE I know. the guy I'm involved with, my parents, my coworkers, my friends.... it's always the same idea, they do something to hurt me and I end up desperately screaming until my throat is raw, yelling obscenities, crying on the floor, begging for them not to leave me, but they always do...

These dreams are absolutely horrid and leave me with an anxious feeling for the rest of the day. anyone else have these ""bpd themed"" nightmares??",bpd_disorder

"Hello everyone!

Recently got properly diagnosed with BPD after originally dealing with Major Depressive Disorder all throughout my teens. I am 23 now. 

My question is what is the next move to handle this condition. I do have a therapist but would certain forms of therapy be better for me such as DBT OR TFP? 

It is seeming the older I get the more traumatic experiences I have endured which I think worsened my mood/thought processes hence why I think this has unraveled into BPD.

"I‚Äôve been in a relationship with someone for a couple years. But the last six months, either they‚Äôve turned into an asshole and been super toxic or I‚Äôm just exaggerating every little thing they do that pisses me off. 

Yesterday was the last fucking straw I stg. We get into an argument. They have the audacity to admit that they‚Äôre piggybacking on me for money and then gaslight me about it right after. 

I‚Äôm furious. I can recall a *number* of times that I‚Äôve been gaslighted by them, as well as other numerous offenses. I‚Äôm this close to ringing up a list and giving it to them, then telling them to get out of my life. 

My problem is that I doubt myself. These things have happened right before my very eyes but *I‚Äôm still not sure that they‚Äôre real*. This could just be me splitting and grabbing whatever I can out of thin air.

"Are strong and uncontrollable emotional responses something that happen daily for you (maybe multiple times a day?), weekly or randomly? And what kind of situations trigger your emotional responses?

I haven't been diagnosed formally but I have traits. 2 days ago I was in a passive aggressive/anxious fury because people were coming over later that day. When I was asked by my husband if I wanted pancakes for breakfast I broke right down into a sobbing mess on the kitchen floor because I couldn't decide if I wanted one.

"I know there‚Äôs something wrong with me and I guess people in my life know that as well. I think most people think I may be narcissistic but I have many BPD traits as well. 

I used to be very shy and reserved, I do suffer from anxiety. And my mental state really depends on outside sources, such as if I have something to do everyday as I hate being alone and bored and if I‚Äôm getting attention from my friends.

When I‚Äôm in a good mood, I‚Äôm high energy, talk a lot, very social, arrogant and high ego. People often say I act with a big ego. I don‚Äôt like doing nice things for my friends as I‚Äôm scared to get used to I usually take from them but I‚Äôm not much of a giver. I like when people look up to me and are impressed by me. I try to act arrogantly as if I‚Äôm better than everyone else. 

I am not known for high empathy, I can sometimes switch it off. I really don‚Äôt know if I feel empathy, I have felt happy before when bad things happened to best friend because in some selfish way I see people as my competition, even though I know he wants good for me. I think it‚Äôs called a ""Schadenfreude"" feeling. I guess I want good for my girlfriend, I truly care for her, even though I don‚Äôt give her much effort, she does everything for me I can‚Äôt be bothered doing much for her. I still in some ways pick myself over her. 

The reason why I think I may be borderline, is because my moods are very unstable. Sometimes I am very down, feel very bad about my life, don‚Äôt want to be alive, anxious, and just low energy. Then something improves my mood and I feel great about myself, I love myself and my personality. Like I feel euphoric during times like this. I fish for compliments I love when people say how fun and confident I am. I often have daydreams about being hella famous and people making edits of me. I would love to be a politician one day and I would make it so that I would be a president of my country forever, fuck elections. 

My biggest fear is being alone, and being abounded I have manipulated friends before so that they don‚Äôt go away to university in different cities so that they stay here for example. I like to keep people to myself. I hate when any of my friends get into relationships because I want all the attention. 

My dad is an obvious narcissist so maybe it got passed down to me, however, I‚Äôve never been close to him, he left home when I was just around 10, now I‚Äôm 23.

I‚Äôve never engaged in self harm or suicide attempts even though I thought about these things before when I was extremely down. 

I‚Äôm not sure who to talk to, it‚Äôs hard to get therapy in my country so I‚Äôm trying to find out what I could possibly have to look into getting better and buy some self help books.",bpd_disorder
"Hi. I don't know what I'm aiming to get out of this. I just don't want to feel alone.

My partner and I have been together for 13 years come tomorrow. I haven't seen them since Friday. They're not coming home until at least Saturday.

It started Thursday. They came home and were, as they said, overly stressed from work. I tried to give them space. I was running to the store to grab something for dinner and asked if they wanted me to grab something for them. They snapped at me. I don't remember exactly what was said between us.

We share a car, so I drop them off at work Friday, and go to work myself. I text them as I'm getting ready to leave, and they say they're hanging out with their mom. Okay, cool, let me know if you need me to pick you up or if she's dropping you off.

They tell me their not coming home tonight, that they need space to clear their head. Weird but okay. They stop home sometime that night to grab a couple things like change of clothes etc. I'm letting them have space and not being a bother, letting them come to me if they need me, thinking they'll probably be back Monday night. Couple days away, no big deal.

They told me Sunday they're not coming back until after Friday. Our 13 year anniversary is Wednesday. I ask if they want to at least have dinner or something - no, they don't. I ask if they're leaving me. They say they ""don't *think* so"".

I lost it at the fact that they couldn't say with certainty that they weren't leaving me. I drank that night, I smoked (weed) that night, anything to distract.

"I have my own BPD tendencies and I feel like if I bothered, I could get a diagnosis, but it's been easier to manage my own symptoms when I tell myself ""it's the bpd, stop reacting like this"" 

I've had weekly therapy too which has really helped. Anyway. I've been talking to this girl for about 6 months and I've made it clear I'm not looking for a committed relationship because I can't do relationships and tbh I'm not even super into the girl, I just prefer her company to the overwhelming loneliness I get. Like, I just wanna have a casual FWB thing. I've been very up front about all of this. She says she's cool with it, but I suspect it ain't. 

The woman structures her days around me, is very pushy about inviting herself over, constantly texts me even if I don't respond, and in those scenarios when she has invited herself over and I tell her not to come over, she reacts poorly and completely detaches for a few days before she starts texting me like mad again. Many of these texts are ""I love you's"" and long-winded showering of compliments. I never return the sentiment. She also keeps buying me shit unprompted and anytime I try to suggest she's violating my boundaries, she deflects. If I enforce a boundary, it ruins her.

I almost wanna cut her off but it's hard to because she's unilaterally well-meaning, nice, and I'm worried she'd do something extreme if I confronted her. I also enjoy her company but not to the degree that I want to spend every waking moment with her.

How do I gently tell her I think she isn't being healthy and I don't think we want the same thing?

"I'm a 22yo woman now, and my first relationship was when I was 15. He was 18, we dated for a year and then he dissapeared 2 weeks, told me he did mdma with 2 girls, cussed me out and broke up and after the break up he was even more mean. I was very in love with him and I never got over it. I dated other people between 15 and now but I still find myself missing him oftentimes. I also *still* feel really hurt about how he acted towards me when he broke up etc. 

I am so sick and tired of missing this man and it just feels like I'll never stop wanting him and I'm so sick of wanting him. It's been 7 years I really want to move on.

Does anyone have experience with this, and can tell me that it *will* end someday? I cannot handle missing him for the rest of my life, I want to start living my life..",bpd_disorder
"CW: Suicidal ideation

Posting requires me to put in some effort or it gets auto removed - I respect that. So here is my effort:

I'm in a deep rut. Lasting months... years... with small glimpses of hope lighting the way. 


This last suicidal ideation has been the most serious. I am planning. My therapist knows. I'm getting more comfortable with the decision the longer I am working towards it. It gives me peace.

The silence hurts me. My trauma mostly unveils it's nasty face in those moments. So music has somewhat been the medicine to my soul. 

As part of my planning and Last Wishes, I made a list of songs I'd like played at my memorial service. Making the list made me realise how big a role music has played in my life. It's been there, allowing me to share my pain and experience exactly as I experienced it. I don't think anything could ever comfort me more than music has had the ability to. 

I've overplayed my music and if I'm going to die I'd love to have listened to a few more great pieces. 

So I ask that you share your absolute favourite song in the comments (if you could only take one song to your grave)? Mine would be 'Time is Dancing' by Ben Howard

TIA

P.S. I'm probably not going to respond to any comments addressing my suicidiality. Mean no disrespect and appreciate your concern.",bpd_disorder

Is this the right place to talk about that? I don't want for it to appear as if I'm bashing anyone, just maybe some validation in that a lot of situations weren't ""my"" fault and was more likely due to that person's BPD. Because I honestly don't know if I was a rubbish partner to her, or if it was me or a combination.

"My mom (58yo) lives with me (33/f) Pretty sure she‚Äôs either narcissistic or bpd herself. I was diagnosed with bpd in 2016, and I‚Äôve either got Stockholm syndrome or trauma bonded to her at this point. My mom was also my abuser in my childhood. I don‚Äôt really know how I managed to stay alive despite her beatings and emotional abuse. My younger brother was her favorite child but he cut her off as soon as he turned 18.

Anyways, my mom and I have been taking care of 7 stray kittens close by our neighborhood. It‚Äôs funny because she has shown more concern for these kittens, than she shows me. She nicknamed me ‚ÄúA.C.‚Äù (short for adopted child even tho I‚Äôm her bio kid). But anyways the issue is, this particular area is a bit secluded and I had an incident that happened back there a few months ago which my mom knows about. A few months back, I was taking my brother‚Äôs dog for a walk and I was being followed by this creepy guy. Basically the guy was mimicking my movement. If I started walking fast, he started walking fast. If I stopped and took a few steps backwards, he did the same thing. I really thought that I was either going to be hurt/kidnapped/killed etc that day because I didn‚Äôt get good vibes from that guy. Naturally I was freaked out because I suffered sexual abuse in my childhood too. 

Now every time we go to feed the kittens, I start feeling really anxious/paranoid and it clicked that I‚Äôm having a panic attack everyday because of that incident. I told my mom that we need to switch up the times that we go over there (just in case someone is keeping a watch on our movements) and she just thinks it‚Äôs hilarious that I‚Äôm so ‚Äúparanoid‚Äù. She‚Äôs called me things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre such a scaredy cat‚Äù, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt realize I gave birth to such a wuss‚Äù etc etc. I‚Äôm literally thinking in my head ‚Äúwell sorry, I don‚Äôt want to get hurt or raped‚Äù.

"I work in a factory.  There are about 18 people on my shift.  4 are women.  One woman is my boss, 3 are my coworkers.  2 of the coworkers are young and attractive.  My boss is a lesbian.  I've busted my ass for months, attempted to help out in every way I can, showed initiative, and I basically am stuck working in the same two spots and given few opportunities to expand my knowledge despite telling my boss I would like to.

Attractive girl 1 is on her phone constantly, makes tons of mistakes.  She is the asst. manager in training.  2 guys applied, one who worked there for 4 years, due to an ""HR error"" their application emails were not forwarded to my boss so it looked like this girl was the only one that applied.  Seems fishy.

Attractive girl 2 was reprimanded for going too slow on multiple occasions.  She isn't a bad worker, but she def does not have the speed that many of the guys do.  She now has been given more responsibility and is in charge of doing quality assurance on my shift, which she needed special clearance for.

I realize I'm not perfect, but for my first 6 months or so at the job (I've been there about 8 months) I worked INSANELY hard.  Went above and beyond.  I did have a day where I left work bc I didn't want to cut myself at work and I was def going to, which resulted in an HR shitfest that I don't want to relive here but it sucked.  

But even so, there are other people who work very hard as well and they aren't given special prestige positions.  Did I fuck up by working hard and should have started out shitty as fuck at my job then incrementally get better?  Or did I just make the mistake of being a man and working for a sexist?

This hurt my feelings because I‚Äôm doing awful in school and I‚Äôm extremely frustrated and disappointed in myself. My dad knows this yet now he says he doesn‚Äôt care. 

So I sat in our living room for this ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù where my dad basically was scolding my younger brother (15M) about how he spends too much money on fast food. My dad kept comparing my brother to me saying I spent way less money than him. I couldn‚Äôt sit there and listen to him talk to my brother in that condescending tone. Yes, maybe my brother could be more wise with his money but he is also a 15 year old kid and the way my dad went about it was very confrontational and disgusting. As well, any time my mom wanted to say something during this meeting my dad would tell her to ‚Äúshut up and don‚Äôt speak unless spoken to‚Äù 

After sitting there 5 mins I started screaming at my dad and told him he‚Äôs gonna give my brother mental health issues just like he did to me. He doesn‚Äôt know how to treat people with respect and he clearly doesn‚Äôt care about anyone but himself. He‚Äôs a complete narcissist.

Firstly, I'm a complete abstraction of what it is to be a human who experiences full spectrum of emotion, it's as if my internal dialogue is someone else and I'm playing a character. My reactions, appropriate displays of emotion, affection, etc. For the past couple years It has been as if I plan out or act as I'm ""supposed to"" semi seconds before display of action. Everything feels like a facade; I dont feel real. I don't feel how other people describe their perception of reality at all. It's like I'm simply existing in a vessel, I walk, talk, and control this vessel yet I am not the vessel itself, simply the operator; except I'm slipping through the cracks: I'm slowly losing grip on the control I have, my empathy is dampening and I'm slowing idealizing acts subconsciously with quite malicious intent and atrocity level result. I'd rather not share what, though the ideal ""targets"" are in the social column of literal scum I know this is not a normal thing to pathologize day to day; and so, I am extending my thoughts to social media to get a second hand opinion: Should I reach out before the mask shatters ?

"I've been realizing that a lot of this disorder is actually lacking the self-evident reality, or even understanding, that certain functions, certain needs, certain resources, should be performed and contained internally and independently. We just didn't have the right programming put into us, or otherwise have a disposition to the opposite.

Healthy people know how to \_\_\_\_\_\_ themselves.

Love themselves.

Trust themselves.

Help themselves.

Reality-check themselves.

Emotionally-regulate themselves.

Soothe themselves.

Esteem themselves.

Validate themselves.

Assure themselves.

Care for themselves

Be kind to themselves

Motivate themselves.

Feel good by themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of my default behavior is looking to others to \_\_\_\_\_\_ me. Like a baby looks to their mother to do certain things. But a baby grows, they become self-efficacious. The separation-individuation phases allow children to do this. If there is trauma, or if this isn't allowed to occur, then some severe issues arise. 

The schema of looking to others causes a weak ego, because if other people are performing functions that are necessary for my self to be stable, I cannot then have boundaries, because I need to fuse with them, I need to push buttons in this world to get other people to perform those functions.

So, if I am to have boundaries, and to not need to push other people's buttons (manipulate), I think I need to at least understand: 

\- Which functions am I looking to others to fulfill? 

\- What payoff do I get from putting my attention where it is right now? What am I doing that for?

\- How can I create a better solution, internally?

If I have an internal alternative to the payoff that someone provides to me, I am not dependent on them. I do not need to give them so much leverage over me, I do not need to put up with crap. Nor do I need to try and push their buttons to get my needs met, because I would just meet that need myself.

What does this ultimately mean? It means that other people are less likely to be engulfed by my needs. Other people are less likely to feel the pull of the black hole inside of me, which needs something from them, and then run away. It means that other people will be free, they won't feel like I've reached my hand into their soul and grabbed a piece of it for myself, and try to shake me loose. They'll see that I totally respect them and I won't need anything from them, and I won't want to forcefully take it, I won't want to trick them to give it to me, I'll actually be a fiduciary for their best interest, because I'm not reliant on them for my best interest, so they don't need to sacrifice what they would have used their time and energy on for themselves on my needs instead.

Some imagery: To become like a shining star, that self-sufficiently produces enough energy to burn bright for millions of years, and maintain its boundaries. To not be a black hole, to not absorb other entities, to not be insatiable or inescapable.

There's a certain power in freedom. And there's a certain aversion to obligation.

"I‚Äôm at an all time low tonight and I am in seek of some reasons, a single reason, that others keep trying to make it through each day? Just to suffer more the next? It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me anymore. 

It‚Äôs been 7 years of diligently fighting to manage Borderline. Therapy (DBT/CBT), medication, oversight by great psychiatrists, exercise, meditation, eating right, even relocating to a different country in pursuit of getting better in a less stressful environment surrounded by nature. 

Everyone always says ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù‚Ä¶. Over and over. And it hasn‚Äôt.

Tonight I‚Äôm really struggling with why I keep fighting? I have no purpose. I live alone. No job. Why should I count making it through another day as a ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù?How is it ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù if it just leads to another day of suffering no matter how hard I try to heal and cope and manage all these symptoms. 

I see nothing in my future but more suffering, loneliness, and burdening those I love. It gets harder and harder to reach out as everyone is ‚Äúso busy‚Äù with their lives and kids and I‚Äôve just‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve lost my star. I‚Äôve lost hope. I am nothing but a vessel of grief, shame, guilt, pain, and agony.

I‚Äôm struggling to eat daily, shower weekly, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I look forward to nothing, I am overwhelmed constantly yet don‚Äôt even do anything.

On top of all of that, relationships just feel icky to me. Like I will always feel like i have to find a way to keep it together before I lose it all.

"Hi, I got my diagnosis yesterday at the grand old age of 35. More than anything it's come at a relief to finally understand why I'm different from other people. I was wondering how many of you told those around you? I've had a lot of time off from work this year, it's sort of been the catalyst to the diagnosis, and people are talking. Would you tell your colleagues/friends so they understand or would you just leave it? I finish the job in a month but want to set people straight that I'm not off just because I'm lazy.",bpd_disorder

I have lost all hope of recovery, 
I started feeling okay recently, everything was going so well and i was making major progress but now my very frail house of cards has come tumbling down again. I'm back to being unstable, I'm taking my medications, I'm doing more things to get out of my shell, going out more, attempting to get a job, but I'm still useless. I stopped smoking about 2 years ago but recently found myself back to it cause I can't handle what I am and what I'm doing to those who surround me. I'm completely at fault, I can't be happy and i don't know what I'm doing with my life. It has no meaning, no reason and no effort to change it on my part. Why can't I just stay well, why do i have to bring everyone and everything down with me, is it because misery loves company? I don't know anymore. I'm not going to commit suicide, but damn i wish I could just die already. Maybe that's why I'm smoking again. I hate everything I'm going through and i hate that i can't seem to stop doing shitty things. I am an awful human and i can't stop being that. I'm so sad, everything seems so bleak.  I did go back to therapy and I'm trying but I'm so tired i can't even clean my room and do my laundry, it's either sleep,  binge eating or smoking, i can't study, i can't seem to apply for new work, i just want this all to be over and done with. My support system has crumbled, i can't put my family through the stress of dealing with my breakdowns again. Everyone around me is going through worse things and I'm here with a brain that doesn't work. I haven't survived terrible stuff to be this way and yet I am, I still feel like I don't deserve to have this mental illness cause my life has always been so easy, yet i always manage to fuck it up. I am so privileged and yet I'm waiting my privilege by being broken. I'm tired. I'm just so tired.",bpd_disorder
So I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed but I think I do show some characteristics of bpd. One that I have noticed is the whole favorite person thing. I think I‚Äôve had 3 my whole life but they were all very far apart. First one when I was 13 second I was 16 and the most recent one at 23/24. Is this common or is it usually one after the other? I think I‚Äôve been dealing with bpd for a while but there are certain things I don‚Äôt think I relate to and that kinda keeps me from even mentioning it to professionals. Also is a diagnoses even necessary if I‚Äôm receiving treatment? I don‚Äôt know if I want be diagnosed because of the stigma. Like I have the fear of abandonment but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever struggled with identity. Idk I want to get better and address my issues but how much does a diagnoses even help?,bpd_disorder
"I'm recently diagnosed but I suppose it is a relief in some ways. There has been a long history of pretty severe  emotional dysregulation but it was often overshadowed by opiate and then stimulant addiction.

Stimulants really accelerated my sexual acting out and it was really demoralizing. I thought if I could just get clean I could put these behaviors behind me. Porn consumption, excessive masturbation, chatrooms, cam sites, random online hook ups that made me feel empty.

Now after nearly 3 years without it, I'm starting to see that I just do this when I feel alone, scared, abandoned, sad, etc. A problem with my SO arose and their own mental health but it has now been resolved. I have to now live with a week of shameful acting out. I hate this cycle. 

I've spent a week just being generally gay online. Chatting with guys, going on cam with them. I guess I'm straight-ish. Maybe it's an attention thing. All I know is I delete all these apps after a run and just cry. It feels like drugs but except I have nothing to blame but myself. It would hurt my SO too, just like if I were getting fucked up.

"sry for wall of text 

im starting to think that i‚Äôm in an almost constant dissociative episode. i always kinda feel like my emotions are forced. everything feels scripted as if i‚Äôm having to tell myself how to react and feel something instead of just intuitively knowing what i think and how I feel. i feel like i‚Äôm thinking for someone else, like i‚Äôm watching things happen and playing a character. i only ever feel real and present when i‚Äôm high. i notice small things happening when i‚Äôm high that i‚Äôd never notice otherwise, i notice textures and smells and tastes and actually have a genuine and instinctual emotion toward them rather than just feeling numb towards everything. unless i‚Äôm feeling in extremes i feel numb, as if i‚Äôm just telling someone how to feel, what to do, and what to say which causes me to have much more dull and mild feelings toward everything. 

though i think this has been slowly building up for the past few years i recently went through something that triggered this episode. it feels like it went from a slow creeping phenomena i‚Äôd experience here and there to instant dissociation. ever since i stopped feeling the immediate danger i was in nothing has felt real and i haven‚Äôt felt fully present since. I don‚Äôt feel like myself. when i think about my past and the experiences i‚Äôve gone through i have little to no emotion regarding them. i feel very disconnected from them and it doesn‚Äôt even feel like i experienced them. like i know these experiences are mine, but they don‚Äôt feel like they happened to me. when i think back to my childhood, even just a few years ago i felt so much more present than i do now. it felt like i was living in the moment, feeling emotions and reacting instinctively. 

i started smoking weed originally to help cope with my bpd symptoms. it grounded me in a sense. everything felt so much more intense while high, emotions and physical feelings. instead of spiraling in my head i focused on my physical surroundings and how they made me feel and it took whatever anxiety i had away. i started smoking regularly about two years ago and these dissociative episodes started almost a year ago and have only worsened. i just don‚Äôt know what to do because smoking is the only thing i‚Äôve found to actually soothe me during an episode.

"I‚Äôve been broken up with my boyfriend (and FP) for more than a month now. It has been a roller coaster of all the emotions specially because at the beginning he wasn‚Äôt clear with his intentions and reassured me that we would talk eventually (because I was in another country at the time). But after coming back I realized that he is in complete denial and was expecting to just be friends and chill (with no conversation or reparation or acknowledgement of all the shit that went down). I got really mad and did the usual ‚Äúcall him 30 times and text him every angry though that comes to mind‚Äù.

After talking to some friends they reassured me that my anger was justified and cutting him off was the right move, but I can‚Äôt stop feeling that I‚Äôm being selfish and uncaring.
If I accepted our friendship he would still be in my life, but I wouldn‚Äôt be confortable without him acknowledging how bad he hurt me.

It has triggered a really bad depressive episode where I can‚Äôt get out of bed and just let every day pass by. 

I don‚Äôt know what to feel anymore, or if my feelings are justified or just triggered by sulking by myself. I just keep remembering all the shit that I put him through and all the times he was compassionate and understanding. I feel that I should get past my anger and try to make the best out of our relationship, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm betraying my limits.

I think that's why I've been making such bad decisions. I'm trying to replace the feelings I've lost, that euphoria I felt when I was with them. Nothing will ever be enough. I've been so alone despite having a loving new boyfriend. Every time I think of them the sadness makes me sick. Like I want to scream and cry and gag. I have to maintain a relationship with the person who did things to me or else I'll get in trouble. I have to keep dating him or it'll be a nightmare. I can't believe how stupid I am. I just want to sleep forever, not die, but sleep until things are ok. Despite being afraid of my mother I want to stay with her forever because I'm safe here. I'm not an adult, I haven't grown up at all. And yet I've been 30 since I was 12. I'm so scared of the real world I wanna stay locked in my room forever. I want my old friends back.

"Let me preface this with the fact that I have not been officially diagnosed with BPD. I‚Äôve always known something was off, but after reading up on it these past few weeks I‚Äôm almost certain I could have it.

I love my boyfriend more than anyone I‚Äôve ever loved before, and that‚Äôs the honest truth. He‚Äôs your ideal guy in just about every way imaginable. But‚Ä¶.any time things don‚Äôt go my way. Any time my expectations are not met. I can‚Äôt let it go. 

Little things trigger me that shouldn‚Äôt trigger me and I lash out at him. I pick fights that shouldn‚Äôt be picked when he‚Äôs just being a genuine guy looking out for both of our best interests. 

I swing from being head over heels for him to extremely irritated with him for honesty no good reason. We argue about once or twice a week. This week we‚Äôve argued every single day. And when I‚Äôve calmed down I am shocked and feel immense shame for the things I‚Äôve said. I am so mean for no good reason, and it‚Äôs never true to how I feel.

Tonight he told me he didn‚Äôt believe that I loved him. That I was in it to use him. Which‚Ä¶my heart aches so much, because it‚Äôs the opposite. I‚Äôm in it for this wonderful guy. He is the love of my life and I see a future with him. I want him to trust and believe me. I am surprised he is still with me at this point, with all this irreparable damage I‚Äôve instilled.

"I'm wondering if anyone else has this experience, because none of my friends do, and I feel very alone and \*extra\* mentally ill lately.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been boy crazy. Starting in second grade, I remember having an intense and obsessive crush on a boy in my class, I pestered him constantly, to the point where he \*and\* my classmates told me they hated me and thought I was crazy (I actually remember referring to him as ""my favorite person"" which is funny now that I think about it).

Every school year, I had a crush on at least one boy that consumed a huge amount of my brain space and had me obsessively writing their names, and my initials+their initials, and all the classic young love crush stuff. I regularly wrote stories about me and \[insert boy\] being in love. I would pray to god every night asking that we could get married (when I switched crushes, I would apologise and ask him to cancel the old request and here's who i \*actually\* want to marry, sorry, please, thank you, in the name of the father, son, holy spirit, amen).

The thing is, I could tell, even at that age, that my crushes were far more intense and obsessive than my peers. And it only intensified the older I got. And after I hit puberty? Forget about it.

I remember thinking pretty fucked up stuff, too. For instance, when my dad died in fifth grade, I remember thinking, ""Well, if my mom dies, I can at least live with my cousin and be with the neighbor boy I am in love with."" I mean, this was my logic as an 11 year old.

Of course, when I actually got my first boyfriend in 8th grade, the sexual element began, and further intensified/complicated my relationship to, well, relationships. I know everyone has different timelines for their sexual awakenings and weird and fucked up stuff happens to a lot of people when they're a little too young. (If my mom knew anything about my experiences, she'd have anyeursm.)

I think a lot was exacerbated by a) my debilitatingly low self esteem and b) I was a chubby girl and the ""DUFF"" of my friend group I guess you could say, so when boys started paying attention to me it was like, really? Me? Yeah, of course I'll s\*ck your d\*ck!

&amp;#x200B;

I am in my mid-twenties now, and I fucking hate this about myself. Sometimes I call myself a hopeless romantic but really, it's me having a panic attack and urges to self-harm when the current obession doesn't text back. Every new prospect is almost immediately my fp and the subject of an exhausting amount of my mental energy. I am imagining what it would be like to live with someone after one tinder hookup. I hate it so fucking much.

I am a quiet borderline, so I don't blow up their phone or beg for their attention or shower them with gifts or anything like that. But if I sense the slightest lack of reciprocation, my heart sinks and there are boulders in my stomach and my throat is on fire and I sob into my pillow and engage in various forms of self-destruction. And then when they text back, my heart soars and I feel elated and euphoric and regain the will to live.

I have so much love to give, and I want someone to give me a beautiful, requited, compassionate, comforting and all-encompassing love right back. I want someone, just once, to be as obsessed with me as I am with them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious about other people's experiences with this. I'm also curious about any of your theories regarding \*why\* this happens. I know personally that I was emotionally neglected after my father died due to my mother's drug addiction, and have had horrendous body image/ED since I was young (thanks mom), and just poor/non-existent self esteem in general. But, it seems to have started so early on, before all of that, so I'm curious if you think there are other factors to this obsessive boy-craziness. Social conditioning? Rom-coms? Seventeen magazine? Astrology? Genetics?

What is your experience?

"I grew up with a pretty normal family for most of the years, parents were married and an older brother. I don‚Äôt know if I never realized this or if it just got worse, but my dad was very emotionally abusive towards me. Also, I don‚Äôt know if this is considered physical abuse, but he would hit me over the littlest things (one time slapped and grabbed by the neck and thrown onto the couch over me not seeing that he called me to come close the garage). He also had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression. Fast forward to when I was 15-16, I first started seeing a psychiatrist for my anxiety (which I have had pretty much my whole life) to be prescribed medications. At this point, my parents had just recently divorced but I was actually happy since I knew how badly he would treat my mom. Later on when I was 17 soon to be 18, I became really suicidal and that feeling just kept getting worse. I developed intense anger that also kept getting worse and around summertime last year I was diagnosed with BPD, bipolar disorder, and depression.  This is when I really started to feel hatred and resentment towards both my mom and dad, but mostly my dad. I had barely been seeing my dad (a couple times a month) in the first place after he moved out around 2 years prior and also only talked to him when he would FaceTime me EVERYDAY. Things between me and him happened that I do not really want to go into which lasted for about 3 months where I had absolutely zero contact with him til my 18th birthday last November. After this we have been speaking, but he doesn‚Äôt know that I actually hate him. A couple months ago back in June I was going to intense anger rampages, we have pictures of him in our house still (mom and dad still on good terms) and I broke/ripped every single picture of him in it. The reason why I blame my mom somewhat is because she just stood by and watched him abuse me all those years and she uses the excuse that she didn‚Äôt want to leave me and my brother alone with him. I think this is complete BS as she could have done so many things (restraining order) to keep us away from him, but decided not to. I have told her a few times during one of my ‚Äúrages‚Äù that it is her fault I am like this and it is her fault that I want to kill myself. I know that she regrets everything about the situation and would do anything to take my pain and give it to herself. She has tried and made it her priority to help me get better, which I love and appreciate her for. My dad has never apologized for anything, nor does he realize he did anything wrong. I do know that he loves me so much, but I just can‚Äôt give him love back as I feel he is the reason for all my suffering and all I hope for him is death.

"The short story is, I am constantly detached from reality, my brain is sped up and constantly firing which makes me appear zany and odd at times, and this all most definitely stems from a cycle of inferiority and superiority complexes that are rooted in my self hate/low self esteem.

The long story: This phenomenon began last fall. The guy I was interested in all summer (he went no contact on me but he didn't leave my mind, it was absolute agony) finally came back late August. It didn't last too long. We first hung out again September 4th, he ended things (for the time being) the first week of December. Through it all, I indulged in plenty of paranoia, obsessive thoughts, fear of abandonment, hyper sexuality. 

Some random September day I came across Black Swan. Then that guy introduced me to Whiplash, then there was the first half of AHS season 10. The obsessive artist trope, the mad genius. All of my bpd symptoms that were drowning me these months, I turned them into writings, collages, and art. The beginning of this year, this all mellowed out up until March. Got dumped and this triggered a spiral. I wrote incessantly about the brainwashing of society and mass psychosis, sold around 90% of my clothes in a park because I saw no reason for material possessions, I made so much chaotic art. I saw myself as the modern philosopher and my reason of being put on this Earth to liberate those under the modern mental slavery. I'd go nuts when seeing groups of people always on their phone, I get on these mental tangents where I think most mental ailments are merely weakness enabled by society because of big Pharma. Theres some truth to these things but it also leads to a very antisocial outlook on my part.

and ugh. I hate it so much. It's now September. This has simply become another massive mood I get into for an hour maybe 2-4 times a day 5-7 days a week. Getting extremely fixated on being brilliant, saving humanity, etc etc. Frankly, it's just plain embarrassing, especially when I decide to post my ideas on my only social media every so often (I don't count this account as that). My creations and ideas are actually met very well but it only adds to my self hatred because it feels attention seeking and like everyone can tell I'm spiraling into madness and I just want to lead an ordinary teen girl life. Even with praise, there are those who stare at me as if I'm constantly spiraling, which I am! And I can't stop.

Maybe this is purely me going neurotic due to a modern world that I can't handle and my bpd symptoms merely emphasize my reactions. No matter the explanation, I can't stand living like this.",bpd_disorder

"So my Bf and I broke up about two months ago. I loved this guy with my whole heart. I loved him more than I ever thought I could love a person. He was literally my world. My everything. We always told each other we would fix everything and then it will be fine. We even planned on moving in together and already had a Amazon Wishlist with everything we wanted to buy. And then everything changed. About two weeks before the break up he started acting weird and cold. That was after he went to his graduation party. That‚Äôs when I think he first cheated on me. Because at this party he met a girl he actually tried to have relationship before (She is his new gf now). He never admitted it to me but a friend of my sent me a message where he sent her all the details about her and how they met blahblah and there he included that he stated meeting her when he was still with me. The next time he cheated was at a birthday party of one of his friend (who I was never allowed to meet because he has ‚Äúno friends‚Äù). He took that girl home because he once again was too drunk to handle himself. So when they arrived at his home he felt fine again so he took her in because ‚Äúhe couldn‚Äôt let her outside‚Äù and then he just fucked her. And the day after they met up again to see if they could become FWB. (At the time he told me he was going to his grandparents). 
He also tried to deny the ‚Äúactual‚Äù cheating. He only admitted it because I told him that it all would hurt less if he cheated on me (with the purpose of him telling me). His actual break up words (over a fucking phone call) were ‚Äúyeah I just don‚Äôt love you anymore and I also haven‚Äôt over the last like 9-10 months)
I really don‚Äôt know why I loved him so much. I don‚Äôt even miss him. It‚Äôs just all the abusive things he did to me that hurt (He not only cheated there is a lot more to that). I just can‚Äôt get in my head how someone who was once nice and sweet could to that to me. He knew who sensitive and gullible I was and he just used that.

I'd be lying if I said my upbringing didn't at least partially lead me into the mental health field (I have my Masters in Social Work), but that is another story for another time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do worry that my relationship with my mother has influenced and continues to influence my close relationships in my adult life. I struggle with interpersonal conflict resolution and avoid confrontation at times because I worry that my partner will lash out if I disagree with them. I feel compelled at times to apologize for how others feel because growing up my mom would weaponize negative emotions I ""made"" her feel against me.   


I worry at times that people whom I am in a relationship with will wake up one day and no longer want to be with me. That one may have something to do with the many phone calls over the years from my mom telling me ""I'm mad at your brother, so you're my favorite right now.""

"In the last month my partner and I have been going through some shit because of a betrayal of trust. Not cheating, but lying and what not. And currently he‚Äôs ‚Äútrying to earn my trust back‚Äù. 

Over the weekend he went and visited a female friend on Saturday night for hours. One I do not trust. Long story short, she‚Äôs been his friend since they were kids and I think she has a thing for him. 

Long story: when I first met this girl I thought she was lovely and added her to social media etc, because I figured I‚Äôd be seeing a lot of her. She would invite us to events and what not, so I returned the favour by inviting her to my events. She wouldn‚Äôt tell me if she was coming, never replied etc until my partner would ask are you coming ? She‚Äôd always claim she never saw the messages even though there was a clear ‚Äúseen‚Äù on her end. This happened multiple times so I stopped bothering. I later realised she had deleted me from socials when I went to tag her in photos. 
The last get together we all had, she completely ignored me and spoke to him the whole time, I tried to join in the conversation but she wouldn‚Äôt even look at me. She would be making remarks like ‚ÄúI never get to see you anymore now that you are with ‚Äúme‚Äù‚Äô. She kept playing with his hair, hugging him, said she loved him a whole lot .. the whole thing made me feel very awkward so I said I didn‚Äôt want to hang out with her anymore. 

Now fast forward to the last weekend, I was very upset he went to her house alone. I told him how I felt and he kept defending her and started yelling at me and saying I was acting like a child etc, tried to say I don‚Äôt like any of his female friends , I corrected him and said that‚Äôs bull I only have an issue with this girl. He tried to say things like ‚Äúoh sorry all of your friends are so perfect‚Äù and made it into a huge thing and brought up a lot of irrelevant things.

Tonight has felt off already. I'm very tired and on edge. I got out of the shower and went to get some lotion, but it came out looking weird, so I said out loud (but to myself), ""I'm not going crazy right?"" 

My fiance heard me from the other room. He sits up and says, ""What's wrong now?"" Now. Now. NOW? I can't explain how badly that triggered an emotional, cote trauma within me and immediately sent me into a flurry of emotions. I went from fear, to guilt, to sadness in the span of one (1) minute. 

Then, he was going to put lotion on my back and the new lotion pump wasn't working. This is where I started to get set off. I kept fiddling with it and eventually I just broke it from hitting the pump too hard. Now I'm even more upset. The pump is broken. Fucking great. 

At this point, I'm starting to go non-verbal and don't want to speak, let alone repeat myself. This isn't my partners fault at all, but I'm trying to motion him to just take the lotion off the pump straw part to use that. He didn't understand and kept doing everything other than just taking the lotion -- again, not his fault at all -- and at this point my rage is building. I'm trying my best to keep myself in line, but I can feel my control slipping. 

All I wanted to do was throw the bottle across the room and start punching myself in the head and scratching my body all over. I kept it together until he left and now I'm sitting here, trying to breathe, trying not to let the BPD win. Still, I want to smash my head against a wall.

" ***Apologies for the long post, for a TL:DR read the last sentence, but it'll be easier if you read it all.***

*To preface, I‚Äôm not splitting, I‚Äôm not breaking down, these are my genuine thoughts.*

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so, I think I‚Äôm in a pretty toxic relationship, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really my fault. It's kind of entirely theirs, but I want to be perfect for them anyway. 

They know what I have, I've explained everything I can to them hundreds of times over; what I need, why I do things, how to help, how to set their boundaries, how to communicate with me, etc.

I've explained everything they need to know hundreds of times. Asked them to do research on BPD, offered to do it with them. I've gotten them websites and videos and I'm willing to break it down for them in a way they'll understand but they just won't. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night they were an utter dickhead.

I was stressed and a bit upset for reasons that had nothing to do with them. (School, things I need to do, falling behind on things, being hungry, etc.) And I asked for some comfort and for them to be nice to me for a little bit. 

They were talking in a way that made me feel like they wanted to leave (one word responses, blunt answers, etc.) and so I started to worry about them being upset at me. I kept asking them to be a bit nicer and to comfort me for just a bit but they didn‚Äôt. I started freaking out about them and started asking them a lot of questions (bad habit).

Then they started ‚Äòcomforting‚Äô me but it felt so genuinely sarcastic. Then I kept asking them questions because I was trying not to freak out and it got to the point where they said:

‚ÄúWill you just shut up, break up with me if you want. I don't care right now. You probably want to break up anyway because you‚Äôre splitting.‚Äù

So I left and ghosted them. They proceeded to guilt-trip me. (‚ÄúI fuck everything up‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo you like me?‚Äù, ‚ÄúI can never do what you need‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never good enough, but I‚Äôm trying‚Äù, ‚ÄúI was tired and stressed from work‚Äù, etc.)

I understand them being tired and stressed from work, but they should have and could have told me before, but they didn‚Äôt even indicate it at all. I would have understood if they told me nicely before all of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

They only apologised this morning after my friend told them to, but they still missed the point. I explained how they could have handled the situation instead and they went on about how they were abusive and never going to be good enough. We are still together though.

They also told me how my emotions were tiring and my episodes were tiring and crap like that. Basically how I‚Äôm tiring.

I promised them I‚Äôd do better, I promised I would manage my emotions and they wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with them again because I really can‚Äôt lose them. I can‚Äôt. 

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôve decided that I‚Äôm going to do everything to be perfect for them. Never upset or angry or anything. I want to hide all my negative emotions from them. So how do I do that? How do I stop them or direct them somewhere else without making it obvious. How do I pretend to be fine with all the shitty stuff they do that they just won‚Äôt stop doing no matter how much I beg.

I‚Äôve given up trying to explain things to them, given up trying to get their help or venting to them or anything, given up showing them anything that isn‚Äôt exactly what they want. I won‚Äôt make them research anything, or do the things I really need because I can‚Äôt lose them.

"I have now been in two very toxic relationships. The second just ended a couple of months ago. Undiagnosed BPD definitely led me to be a toxic person who didn't have enough awareness or understanding to prevent a lot of things I regret. But I find that I am also very easily manipulated into believing I am the sole reason for everything bad that happened, and both of my exes became abusive. I will not be entering into another relationship for a long time, but I am trying to understand what led to this so I can work on it at the root of it within myself. I am able to list out very concrete examples of abuse from both exes, but I still struggle greatly to accept that I was a victim as well. I am trying to understand what happens in my mind that makes it so difficult to accept that I could have been abused. This has been a pattern throughout my life, starting from a young age. 

I idealized my mom from a young age and was brainwashed to believe she was ""the good parent"" who saved me and my sister and sacrificed everything for us. As an adult in therapy I came to realize that I was groomed to be my mom's validator and emotional support, and to keep her feeling good about herself. This pattern of idealizing seems to have continued into many of my relationships as an adult. I have had two very toxic relationships, and I was a large source of the toxicity in both, as a person who had undiagnosed BPD at the time and didn't have enough awareness or tools to manage it. Luckily, that has changed a lot in the past couple of years with a lot of therapy, so I have hope that I will be able to avoid another toxic relationship. But I am trying to understand why I idealize these people the way I do. Both exes became abusive, and both manipulated me into believing I was the problem. Both refused to take responsibility for their abusive behavior, and in turn I idealized them and devalued myself. I believed that because I have BPD, my thoughts and emotions were not reliable, so I trusted them instead. Both exes were very emotionally unhealthy and did not have awareness of this fact, which created a perfect storm - me not trusting myself and struggling not to internalize all of my shame from my unintentional toxicity, and them also telling me I was at fault. This dynamic is very dangerous as I've learned.

I am now in a safe place, with people I trust to not manipulate me. I am trying to understand how this happened so I can prevent it ever happening again. I both need to learn to trust myself (which means I need to continue working to unlearn harmful thought patterns) and to also stop idealizing other people. This feels so overwhelming, because I've been manipulated so much at this point that I feel unable to trust anything I feel. I have concrete examples of abuse, and I still find myself trying to find rationalizations for the things that were done to me. I think my self-worth and my trust in myself are so broken down that I choose to believe other people know better than I do. Even when my gut told me he was being abusive and people in my life confirmed it, I still ended up rationalizing his behavior and convincing myself I deserved it.

How does this happen? I feel so stupid and crazy and alone in it. Not only do I carry all the shame of my own toxicity, I also carry the humiliation of allowing myself to be manipulated and abused. I have to figure out how to recover from this, and somehow understand how it got to this point and unlearn those thought patterns and behaviors. I am struggling right now to believe that's possible, but I'm trying.",bpd_disorder

"TW: drugs, self harm, suicide 

I'm 28. 13 years of near constant therapy. I keep getting better and I keep getting worse.

How did I end up in this hell again?

I can't bear my emotional pain sober. My inner child is screaming and kicking. Screaming for help. It wants me to hurt myself or others. It hurts so much. Drugs help.

Someone also (apparently) reported me to the police. I created a fake persona online. That persona is basically my BPD with barely any healthy part left. I have an IG account and I'm on other social media, too. So people are witnessing me spiraling for about a year now and I'm constantly lashing out and being very honest. Now someone says they have a case against me and they might honestly do, I don't know. It's a gray zone. The most fucked up shit was said by my fakers. Yes, some people fake my fake persona. It's incredible. But they think it was me. I'm not sure what might happen. This whole thing is purely on the internet, mostly based around fake profiles and anonymous boards. The police might honestly just laugh at this absolutely psychotic dynamic. 

Still. I can't stop. Not even the thought of legal issues makes me stop. I'm already thinking about what to post tomorrow. It distracts me from my pain. Just like drugs. Anything to distract me. Anything is better than that pain. 

I need help. I sent my old trauma therapist a mail. Of course I sound totally fine. I hope he gets it. I need help. I'm out of control. I only trust him.

"It's clawing at the pit of my stomach. I don't know how to describe the feeling. Physically, it's like anxiety, but the source feels like sadness. It feels like I'm drinking a shot of whiskey every 30 seconds. Except none of the benefits.

I know it will pass eventually but I had it the entire day today, and much of yesterday. I almost started shaking yesterday trying to contain it. Today was a bit more laid back and more tired so hopefully tomorrow will be better. I want to cry but I physically cannot muster more than a couple tears. Don't know when that happened. I used to be able to cry so easily. Haven't been able to in a few years and nothing traumatic happened during that time. 

I've been posting here for a few days about a FP I've developed. Nothing new on that end (not that anyone is following lol) but my thoughts are getting worse. Haven't had an FP in a very long time. Not one like this, anyways.

I am analyzing my, well obsession I suppose with this person. That I barely know. And I am thinking about how much it is impacting my emotions. Yes, it's a new person and things are exciting, and these intense feelings are temporary even though they feel like they'll be forever.

But something I really think will be forever is the presence of these intense periods of joy followed by grief. And it makes me wonder how I will fare down the line. I'm a young adult. Already left a career due to social stress and took two small jobs. I like the *work* itself but it's the social aspects - or rather my internal schema revolving around these social aspects - that are slowly killing me. One of them has the FP and I am considering leaving that after only a few months. And I wonder; will it be like this at every job? If I do wind up dating this FP will it all just magically go away (no, lol, but I'd have a lot more energy to work on myself I reckon ...)? The pay's not great but the hours are flexible and I like the people I work with. I really like one of them. 

TW: &gt;!I am a survivor of a few suicide attempts from my teens. I believe that my brain, either from damage or from emotional shielding, has forgotten my feelings from then. I can safely say though that I think I must feel about as bad as I did back then. Although I am NOT considering harming myself at all. Thank goodness. Because really, what would that solve? Buttfuck nothin', that's what. I'm here for the long haul. !&lt;

I really don't know what to do. I want to keep working there both for my financial security and because, I really want to see her. But I am dreading possible heartbreak and wondering if it would be best for everyone there if I just quit. And if it would be best for myself. It would suck for a time, especially financially, and the hollow cold loneliness, but eventually things would be better. Until another FP came along ...

I just can't help but imagine what it would be like to be with her. I would feel so safe. I just want to feel safe and secure and loved. I want to be loved by someone I love, not just someone I tolerate. Just for a little while. It's ambrosia. I'd do anything to know how she felt. To know if I had a chance.

And typing shit like the above paragraph makes me think I would repel just about every reasonably sane person on the fucking planet. I just can't stop thinking about her. I wish I could, desperately. I'm trying to. But every activity I do I just go on goddamn autopilot and spend all my mental energy thinking. About her and her smile and shit. And how strong she is. And how I'd support her when she wasn't strong. If she liked me. Which I don't know, and I'm scared to know. So very scared. 

I've broken enough hearts. I need to date someone I really, really care about. Not someone that fills the void of an FP. But dating an FP is feeling impossible. Impossible to start. And I don't even know how to maintain it if it did. I had one once. Did not end well. But I'm wiser and keener now. Maybe it'll work this time, right? Maybe I've got a chance.

god everything is getting harder to hold on to. i have so many people around me who say they love me, but somehow i just cant accept it. i feel so alone even when im not.. i dont want to take everyone for granted but it seems like its just impossible for me to grasp that i am not alone. this whole rant is pointless too lol. im just so confused, i want to die all the time but i have things holding me back like leaving my friends. i dont want to die at the same time either which is frustrating because all i feel is a constant dullness and it never stops no matter how many times i spoil myself. sometimes i feel like i dont have bpd at all and maybe my manic episodes are just fake and all for attention. was everything i told my therapist actually real or was it all for attention???? i dont know myself and i dont know if ill ever figure it out. i feel like a fraud. i cant even bear thinking of anything from the past because i constantly get confused whether it was something i fabricated or if it actually happened. are my friendships genuine or did i coerce them into this friendship?? does my partner actually love me fr and chose to be in this relationship or is she just staying because she doesnt want me to impulsively hurt myself? i am in a constant state of confusion and the only thing ive been doing instead of actually getting help is recklessly spending all my money and lie myself out of trouble. on top of that my parents dont even believe in my mental illness which makes the invalidation feeling worse. gahhhh idk what to do with myself, i just feel so empty.",bpd_disorder
"TW: SA





Since my first fp assaulted me, since the trauma of our relationship. He‚Äôs a narcissist of course. The past few days have been hard. Sometimes I still feel like that girl, longing and wanting nothing but the affection he would never give me. Wanting nothing but to be desired by him. I tried so hard to be what he wanted. I daydream about it still lately these days. And my dreams speak volumes. He‚Äôs married now with kids. I think transforming into the girl he wants but now can never have. When will I stop thinking about how much I hate him? How much I still sometimes wish we could‚Äôve worked out?My heart breaks for that girl. The girl still stuck in her bathroom under the covers because the sunshine felt too happy. My heart breaks for her, my soul aches for her. When will I never think of him again? I know the answer.

"My mom cheated on my dad when I was 10. She said she loved him, she just made a bad choice. I promised myself I would never do that to the person I loved. I've been with my boyfriend for a year now, and I just moved away. Since we're doing long distance he said it was okay to be physically affectionate with other people, so long as I don't have sex with them.

I met a boy, however. He asked me to come over and kept showering me with compliments and kept kissing me and it just felt so good after weeks of no physical affection. At some point it felt like my brain literally turned off. The next thing I knew he was getting off me, saying how good it was. I don't even remember it.

I don't know what to do, so far I just decided to keep it to myself because I don't want my boyfriend to leave me. I love him more than anything in the entire world, I feel disgusted with myself for even going over to that guys house. I confided in my mother and she said if I loved him, I should hide it. I hate myself now more than I ever have before. I didn't want to cheat, i dont want to break his heart. I've just laid in bed this weekend and cried, he has no idea why I'm upset. He facetimed me and seeing his face made me want to tear my heart out.",bpd_disorder
"As title reads, my boyfriend and I recently broke up. Originally he chose to end things with me and I came over to his to convince him to stay. I agreed to whatever he wanted, I told him everything he wanted to hear because I was so scared of losing him. And after I saw him, it all got too much and I detached. Every word he said to me, burned in my mind. I tried so hard to love him as best as I could, I apologised, I attended therapy and was starting to feel safer with him. I never once really detached with him.

When I came over to his, he said some really hurtful things in the ways he perceived me and who I was. Despite how much I loved him and treated him with kindness, he still saw me as a big flaw. He made me question myself and my mind went into overdrive before I detached. 

He messaged me after that night and said he wanted to give us one last chance. I said okay but at that point I felt nothing. I didn't care whether he messaged me again or if I ever saw him again. He noticed I was different and questioned me which eventually led to us ending things mutually. I said bye, blocked him and felt nothing. We broke up a few months prior and I felt devastated the whole time, obsessing over him. I thought I was the problem and needed to fix myself. Eventually we (obviously) got back together.

Sorry if the story is jumping everywhere; my thoughts are everywhere. This time though, it feels different. Like I've flipped a switch on my emotions and I can now see him for who he is. Occasionally though, my emotions come trickling back. I guess my worry is that the detachment will eventually lift and I will be devastated all over again. The issue is, he's not right for me. He makes me feel so worthless. Since we broke up I've been a lot more motivated to look after myself. I'm worried, in those moments my emotions trickle back, that I will start idolizing him again. I don't tend to relapse on FPs when I start feeling like this but it still worries me.",bpd_disorder
"The loneliness is excruciating and can‚Äôt help but turn into sadness. It‚Äôs not as if I have people in my life and I just can‚Äôt see it or I‚Äôve pushed everyone away.

"I know this is long and no one will read this but I really need to write about it somewhere. I've never been active on this sub but i've been struggling with BPD for a while (diagnosed for around two years) as well as eating disorders my whole life, and anxiety and depression for the last five. 

I (F24) broke up with my FP (M25) last Monday. I didn‚Äôt realize he was my FP until after I broke it off. The truth is that for the past three months since i met him he was the focus of my entire life. Everything I did was around him and 100% of my emotions depended on him, going from euphoric to extremely depressed in a mater of seconds depending or not in wether i got a text from him or wether or not he wanted to see me. There was never a problem when we were physically together, but once we were apart my anxiety kicked in and I became super paranoid and jealous and obsessive. I never showed any of these traits towards him, I would never double text or call him twice or express jealousy, etc. I would only ask for constant validation (for example, ‚Äútell me i‚Äôm pretty"", ""do you like me?"" ""do you like spending time with me?"" etc.), especially during sex, which i knew he thought was weird. I never told him anything about my anxiety or my extreme emotions so instead I would just let my life fall apart and cry myself to sleep. He wasn‚Äôt my boyfriend, it was a romantic situation initiated by him after meeting him during a weekend getaway with a group of mutual friends. He was all in at the start but eventually the situation transitioned into FWB because he couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúoffer me a relationship‚Äù, i think that was the exact moment I started obsessing. I pretended to be fine with it cause I wasn't willing to let go, however, for me at least it never stopped being romantic. It wasn‚Äôt just about sex, we would go on dates and talk every day and hang out to do other stuff. We talked about everything and never stopped being exclusive. A lot of the things he said and did made me think he wanted more, but looking back i was probably overly attached and delusional or just confused. He wasn't a bad person. He always told me exactly what he wanted (on a verbal level), i just believe he started to like me too at some point and started doing and saying things not deemed casual which was confusing to me. 

Obviously it ended badly because his emotional unavailability led to him being inconsistent, somedays he would be the nicest, most into me person, treat me amazing, and then the next day he would take ten hours to respond a text and bail on me last minute for his friends or family. The highs were AMAZING, but the lows were unbearable and they were becoming more and more frequent. I decided to end it because it was clear to me that i wanted more and he wasn't sure and it was really triggering for my BPD. My anxiety and depression were (and still are) worse than ever, i had to increase my dosage of antidepressants and i got back into old ED habits these past months becoming severely underweight. I‚Äôm usually emotionally dependent on my romantic relationships, but they tend to be way more short lived and not as deep as this. I think it‚Äôs the first time I develop a romantic FP, i'm actually not sure i've ever had an FP, though looking back i've had some very toxic and dependent friendships in the past.

I went to the psychiatrist last Wednesday and he upped my dose of SRRIs and told me he thinks my BPD is worse than ever. Him and my friends and family are really worried about my weight and I am now being constantly observed and pressured towards eating. The thought of eating makes me sick and the thought of gaining back the weight i put off scares me to death. Everyone thinks that anorexia is the biggest of my problems because it's physically dangerous but no one was worried when I used to binge eat and was a couple of pounds overweight. All that worries me is how depressed I am. I see no way out of this.

I broke it off (kind of abruptly) because i thought it would be better to feel sad for a while than perpetually anxious. On the day it happened I acted impulsively and just lashed out on him after sex (i didn't want to have sex in the first place and felt no pressure on his behalf, just kind of felt this impulse), i said some horrible things. I told him i didn't want him in my life anyway because he's a drug addict with daddy issues and no ambitions whatsoever in life, and then i told him the only reason i ever liked him was because he was fucked up in the head and that was just my type. I made it seem like I wasn't interested in anything serious (a lie), just tired of the way he was treating me but I acted very aggressively and used intimate things he had told me to actually hurt him. I was fine the day after, i really hated him and never wanted to see him again. I obviously then regretted everything i said and this past week i've been feeling like dying. I think about him all the time from the minute i get up to the moment I go to bed. I'm constantly checking on him on social media and creating fake scenarios in my head that he'll suddenly call me and tell me he misses me and wants to be with me romantically. Even if this happened, I know that no amount of attention will ever be enough for me not to feel anxious and insecure, extremely fearful of anyone walking out on me. It's all I think about, I can't work, I can't sleep, I can't lead conversations with others. I keep thinking of things I could've done differently to get him to love me, maybe if I hadn't said this or that or acted differently this one time or been skinnier. I keep imagining how he hates me (based on that last encounter) and never wants to see me again. What scares me the most is that I felt so much for him, and I'm scared that he had absolutely no feelings towards me ever and was just using me for his ego. This is going to sound horrible but I'd rather know that I really hurt him and have him hate me, because it's the only way i'd know that he cared at some point. I know it was stupid to put myself in a situation like this considering my history of mental health. 

I'm a really social person and have a LOT of friends, and not in the superficial way. I actually feel a close connection to a lot of people. I know people with BPD don't tend to have long lasting stable relationships and even though for me it's always been true romantically and family wise, I make friends really easily and for the most part develop healthy long lasting relationships. Lately I've been receiving so much love. All my friends knew about my FP situation, most of them met him and saw us together. Even though most of them don't know I have BPD, just my family, (it's not because i'm embarrassed or anything, I just don't want people labeling me and acting differently) they know i'm extremely emotional and impulsive and know about my underlying mental health disorders. They know how hard this ""break up"" was on me and are all constantly checking in on me, texting me, sending me memes and playlists asking me to hang out. They listen to me, give me feedback, my male friends tell me the nicest things to lift my ego (not in a creepy way). I even feel overwhelmed because knowing about my ED my friends are constantly buying me food because they believe this situation will trigger me (already did). I know I should feel so loved, my family has been the same. Super supportive even though we've been going through rough patches lately. Still I can't help but isolate because it seems to me like none of this matters if I don't have FP. I feel like no one understands, like my friends all think they get it but no one feels heartbreak like people with this mental disorder were you literally feel like your mind is playing tricks on you and you just go through life floating around trying to get over someone. I feel like a could trade fifty people who are giving me unconditional love just for the slightest attention from this one person. 

I don't think i'll ever be able to have a relationship with anyone, I can't let any relationship develop naturally because I always need more than ANYONE can offer. I always bail before I get really hurt but then end up regretting it and more hurt than before. I also always tend to go for people who are emotionally unavailable and have never been capable of liking anyone who is actually interested in me. 

I don't know what the point of posting this was, i just really needed to write it all down even if no one reads this. If anyone does, please give me advice on how you've gotten over past FPs without necessarily finding a new one. I'd really like to heal by myself and not be emotionally dependent on anyone like this ever again.",bpd_disorder

I‚Äôm so fed up with feeling trapped in this inescapable cycle of hating myself and feeling powerless to change anything.

I just want to stop trying. Everything I do feels like it blows up in my face. I moved away from a place I hated and within 6 months burned my entire savings just surviving while looking for a job, had my car stolen along with like $3000 worth of shit, my insurance company paid the book value of the car so I couldn‚Äôt afford to replace it and they scummed out of paying for all the property inside because the lazy fuck cop that took the report didn‚Äôt want to list my property, took a retail job and felt like more of a failure with my advanced degrees and internships, finally managed to get a decent job and within a month I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I‚Äôm back living with family in a place I hate, broke, and have no hope for anything to get better. I can‚Äôt even think about having a job right now, I can‚Äôt even start thinking about what I want or can even do. 

I want to leave this place so bad. I hate being here. It‚Äôs so fucking hot and without a car it‚Äôs so frustrating having to ride a motorcycle in this heat. My friends and I talk about moving closer to each other since we live all over the place and don‚Äôt get to hang out more than a few times a year, but I‚Äôm so scared they don‚Äôt want me around.

I‚Äôm anxious that I just want out of this place so badly that I‚Äôm going to try and make another big move that‚Äôs going to blow up in my face. I‚Äôm scared that I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to pull off moving again, even if I don‚Äôt move there. I need to get out of where I am now for sure. 

I haven‚Äôt texted her in almost a week so I reached out today to see if we can talk or if she needs more space and she hasn‚Äôt answered.

I‚Äôm so angry at myself for making this about me. Why am I so fucking selfish? Why must everything be about me?

It‚Äôs so bad right now that I literally don‚Äôt want to be around or interact with anyone but her until I know everything is okay.

I want to go home and drink until this doesn‚Äôt hurt anymore.

I just want her to say something. Tell me it‚Äôs okay, tell me it‚Äôs not okay. Please just tell me if you need to be left alone for a bit. I love you more than I can ever put into words. If I did something wrong please just tell me, please give me a chance to fix it if I fucked up in any way. I would do absolutely anything for you. If you just need me out of your life‚Ä¶I‚Äôd do that for you too. I love and care about you more than I could ever love or care about myself.

I‚Äôm so tired of knowing this will never go away, I‚Äôll just *maybe* get better at dealing with it. Lately I‚Äôm so tired of this that I‚Äôve been inching into dangerous territory with ideation. Like how I‚Äôd go through with it and mentally writing letters to everyone. Even in my fucking mental suicide notes all I can do is apologize and seek validation. I also feel so pathetic because I sit and think about how people would react and what they would think. Would she think I just did it to be manipulative? Would she think this is just my way of lashing out and trying to hurt her? I hope she doesn‚Äôt think that little of me. Would she just be angry because I know how many people she‚Äôs lost to suicide? I‚Äôm worried because right now the only reason I won‚Äôt go through with it is knowing that others would be sad, that‚Äôs literally it.

I moved away from a place I hated and within 6 months burned my entire savings, had my car stolen along with like $3000 worth of shit, my insurance company paid the book value of the car so I couldn‚Äôt afford to replace it and they scummed out of paying for all the property inside because the lazy fuck cop that took the report didn‚Äôt want to list my property, had to take a retail job and feel like more of a failure with my advanced degrees and internships, finally managed to get a decent job and within a month I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I‚Äôm back living with family in a place I hate, broke, and have no hope for anything to get better. I can‚Äôt even think about having a job right now, I can‚Äôt even start thinking about what I want or can even do. I want to get the fuck out of here, I hate how hot it is and I hate feeling like such a useless failure, and I don‚Äôt know how or when I‚Äôll be able to save money. I don‚Äôt even know where I‚Äôd go. My friends and I all talk about moving closer together since we live all over the place and lately we‚Äôve been on the ‚Äúmove to (FP) state‚Äù, but I can‚Äôt stop feeling like she wouldn‚Äôt want me there. I‚Äôm anxious thinking about how every other move I‚Äôve made ended badly for me. 

I haven‚Äôt texted her in almost a week so I reached out today to see if we can talk or if she needs more space and she hasn‚Äôt answered. Rationally I know she‚Äôs probably just busy but all I can think is she wants me out of her life. I don‚Äôt even know what I did wrong other than being too attached to her. I don‚Äôt ever lash out or anything like that. I know I‚Äôm annoyingly clingy but I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong and I can‚Äôt stop sitting here obsessively replaying every interaction we‚Äôve had in the past month to dissect if I did something. I feel selfish because I know she‚Äôs going through a ton of personal shit and my stupid fucking brain just keeps obsessing over how she feels about me. I wish I could just leave her alone and not worry that if I don‚Äôt make an effort she‚Äôll abandon me. I‚Äôm so fucking scared that I‚Äôm just pushing her further away. I feel disgusting and guilty for making this about myself and I don‚Äôt know how to just‚Ä¶not.

It‚Äôs so bad right now that I literally don‚Äôt want to be around or interact with anyone but her until I know everything is okay. I went to a family thing and just‚Ä¶.don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone at all. I‚Äôm sitting outside in this abominable heat soaked in sweat so I can chain smoke in silence alone. I want to go home and drink until this doesn‚Äôt hurt anymore. 

I just want her to say something. Tell me it‚Äôs okay, or tell me it‚Äôs not okay. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm so fucking needy. I‚Äôm sorry I constantly seek validation and reassurance. I love you more than I can ever put into words. Please just tell me if you need to be left alone for a bit. If I did something wrong please just tell me and let me try and fix it. I‚Äôd do absolutely anything for you. Even if you needed me gone. I‚Äôd do that for you because I love you and care about you more than I could ever love or care about myself. 

I‚Äôm so tired of knowing this will never go away, I‚Äôll just *maybe* get better at dealing with it. Lately I‚Äôm so tired of this that I‚Äôve been inching into dangerous territory with ideation. Like how I‚Äôd go through with it and mentally writing letters to everyone. Even in my fucking mental suicide notes all I can do is apologize and seek validation. I also feel so pathetic because I sit and think about how people would react and what they would think. Would she think I just did it to be manipulative? Would she just be angry because I know how many people she‚Äôs lost to suicide? I‚Äôm worried because right now the only reason I won‚Äôt go through with it is knowing that others would be sad, that‚Äôs literally it. I feel like I‚Äôd be being selfish if I went through with it. 

I just wish this would go away. I wish I could just, not wake up tomorrow. I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore.",bpd_disorder

Come to find out a month ago I figured out what exactly happened. In April he got with a drug dealer and got a week supply dose of adderall which he had a long history of abuse with. During this time he Snapchated an old tinder fling with lots of nude photos, sexting, talks of meeting up, etc. i also found his only fans which he was active on as well as some throw away Kik accounts with old sexting conversations. I also found an old phone hidden under the couch which had all of this information on it. Keep in mind I just found out I was pregnant the day before I found all of this. Ever since this happened I‚Äôve been obsessively paranoid. After that rough patch happened and I was oblivious we talked of marriage and we even bought each other rings. He apologized profusely and we started couples counseling, weekly drug tests, and deleted all problematic social media accounts. I want to believe that he changed since April and he does truly want to be with me. He blames the pills and even has an appointment with a substance abuse therapist.

"TW: mention of Self-harm/Suicidal Ideation

I want to preface this by saying I was given a soft diagnosis so it isn't an official one.

I want to mention also that I had a previous therapist when I was young suggesting I might be bipolar (it's pretty clear now as an adult that I am not bipolar). But I essentially went to therapy for very bad anxiety that was affecting my job and went from one therapist to another until I landed on a final one. 

Now all the therapists I saw during this time was from the same company. The first two were really focused on me dissociating and my anxiety triggering dissociation. The final one though when she got me as a new client told me that she had previous interactions with my other therapist, we had had like maybe three sessions (this new one and I) and after we had finished going over my history she let me know she thinks I may have BPD. 

As I said she told me that she had this inkling from talking to my previous therapist (they had the same supervisor) so going over my history she landed on me having a lot of symptoms that line up with BPD. However, everyone who knew me was shocked by what she thought I had. I was also shocked too. 

My boyfriend was adamantly in denial and even talked to his therapist about it as well. Now looking back at it all I understand everyone's hesitance when it came to the diagnosis this therapist gave me. I do have anger issues and I can admit that I have a pretty bad relationship with my dad, bad anxiety, AND a history of dissociating and self-harm as well as suicidal thoughts.

BUT now that she is no longer my therapist a lot of my symptoms have kind of vanished. She had to let go of me as a client because her new supervisor (the employment issues here were ridiculous) thought I was not making progress and granted I agreed. So we parted ways but now it's been months apart and I feel sort of back to somewhat neurotypical.

I think my therapist failed to take into consideration that I have ADHD which comes with emotional dysregulation and a father with anger issues that I picked up. AND pretty bad anxiety that I am now on medication for-all of those are things that could explain a lot of why my behaviors aligned with a BPD diagnosis. I know misdiagnosis happens alot with mental health and I just wanted your guys thoughts and opinions.

You guys have been such a welcoming community and have kept me feeling seen despite my questioning my diagnosis right now. So please give me some input, I would really appreciate it.",bpd_disorder

"So just a brief idea of how I feel day to day.

I have what I feel like is a voice in my head telling me to do bad shit but the voice is mine. I would never do these things but those thoughts are always there and always the worst type possible.

I sometimes have music play over and over in my head but like say just the chorus of a song but over and over and over.

I feel like I want to end my life so so much but then when I get the slightest issue with my health I‚Äôm petrified of it being something bad.

I can go from ultra happy and feeling like I just won the lottery to so bad I am just numb.

I become obsessed with a person and spend loads of time looking them up or thinking about them then I can just forget instantly and move on.

I over eat even though I know it‚Äôs bad for me.

I play out scenarios in my head and when they are bad I play out the worst possible scenario and then feel upset like it just happened. I also play out good scenarios sometimes usually sexual.

I don‚Äôt trust anyone 100% and I get super paranoid and believe people are watching me or we are in some type of Truman show.

I can adapt to any situation and choose my conversation and demeanour based on what is needed (This one distresses me because it can be extremely manipulative).

I hate my appearance but at the same time unless I look in the mirror I don‚Äôt feel I look or sound the way I do.

I sometimes feel scared that I‚Äôm alone even when people are around me and I have good times (very few). I have like an instant weird tingle feeling and I feel like I don‚Äôt fit anywhere and it scares me.

I have never in my life known what I have wanted to do and I have bounced around to all different things.

I have no regard for the law (although I mostly obey it) as well as any authority and I HATE being spoken down to.

"Lately I've been feeling like my bf doesn't love me anymore. But I don't know if it's rational or if it's my BPD and I'm just feeling things more intensely. I'm worried it could be my BPD getting worse again because I was doing really well right (apart from social anxiety) but then I stopped taking Topiramate (for my migraines) which I'd been taking for 6months ish and I also got my contraceptive implant removed. So I'm worried that either of those things could be fucking my emotions and making me feel things more intensely?


Why I've been feeling like he doesn't love me anymore:

- sometimes we just sit in silence next to eachother on the sofa but not really with eachother. I'll try and talk to him but he'll just give me short answers and not try and carry on the conversation. I've asked him if he's ok when this happens and he always says he's fine or just tired.

- we haven't been having sex very regularly for a while. It's been at least 3 months since we had a regular sex life (and since I've orgasmed please kmn). This was partially down to me because my hormones were fucked from the contraception and I had 0 sex drive. But it's been back to normal for a few weeks now and our sex life hasn't really gotten any better. I've initiated a few times and a couple times we have had sex but it hasn't really gone great but he barely initiates at all so I'm worried he doesn't really want to have sex with me.

-  this probably sounds silly but often we'll be sat on the sofa together and he will just randomly say he's going up to bed and give me a kiss and then go upstairs. It really makes me feel like he doesn't care because he doesn't ask if I'm coming to bed with him or encourage me not to stay up too late. (I always do this when I decide I want to go to bed first). It makes me think he doesn't want to sleep next to me. I'm worried this is irrational but it really really bothers me even though I know it sounds silly.

- I don't feel like we're excited to see eachother or do thing with eachother any more. For context we've been living together for 2 years now and we both work from home.

"Borderline Personality Disorder is not an excuse but it was the major factor of my behavior. 
I'm finally able to speak and admit that my mental health has taken a turn for the worst. I did everything I could to better myself by learning to a few coping skills and distracting myself but in a period of what has at least felt like the last 4 months I disassociated and became an actual monster. I looked in the mirror and could only think about how the person I was looking at wasn't me. My thoughts were disconnected from my body. It usually starts that way; I fall in love, get my feelings hurt, fall out of love with myself and take it out on the other person because I don't deserve them. ""Make em leave before they leave on their own/they're going to leave anyways"" kinda deal. I had it good this time. Yeah there were faults to them but everyone has them. I took it upon myself to push them away for falling short of the person I idealized them to be, even though I loved them for who they really were. It was always ""You're so perfect."" until they weren't what I made them up to be in my head or I imagined scenarios of them planning to leave me (or due to previous trauma, use me). I out right LOOKED for things wrong in the relationship then spiraled on images of women that I looked nothing like (that he wouldn't have stood a chance with at that) and proceeded to eat both myself and his sanity alive thinking about them on repeat.
I became a terrible person, AGAIN. I fit the stereotypical BPD abuser narrative that I never wanted to be but ended up being. I've never been more remorseful for my actions in my life and can't even apologize for being actual garbage because my means of pushing them away this time were past deplorable and, rightfully so, they went no-contact. I'm glad I'm finally seeking help. I'm thankful that they supported me doing so before hand or else I wouldn't have seen the psychiatrist that gave me a C-PTSD therapist referral.

A lot of things make me upset. From perceiving hostility/contempt in others' words/tone, loud/low-pitch noises, being ignored, feeling as if I don't know what to do... etc.

I find that it's very important to know how to calm down, especially when I don't know it ""instinctively"". If I don't do anything consciously, I usually end up stressed out for hours, or even days, which burns me out and usually makes the real-world problems even worse.

**So how do you calm yourself down? What are your best techniques?**

For me, this is a short list of things that work for me:

\- calm music, usually classical piano or harp

\- laying down and consciously relaxing all the muscles in my body

\- focusing on my environment, explicitly trying to describe it in my head (this one I learned in therapy, and it's really hard to perform when upset, but very effective)",bpd_disorder

"Hi guys. I‚Äôm 32F and I‚Äôm spiraling and being irrational and I am afraid I‚Äôm going to ruin something really good. 
Thank you to anyone who will read this.

To preface this I have ruined my relationship with the last man I have loved 5 years ago because I acted like a total nut, jealous, possessive and overly dramatic. Took me years to come back from it. I feel I could possibly go down that road again and I need help getting down to earth. 

I recently met a man that I really like, we‚Äôve been dating for a little over a month and had our first night together last week. He‚Äôs been great all along. He always text back right away, is really upfront and takes the lead, he shows me that he cares every time we see each other. 

But here is the thing, he has a really busy life. Like reaaaaally busy, his job requires a lot of after hours networking and travelling and he has lots of friends, family, stuffs in his life. 

I don‚Äôt, like at all. I am new to the city we both live in and my ¬´¬†best friend¬†¬ª that moved here with me cut bridges two months ago. I am still mourning her (went through a pretty deep suicidal phase), and I‚Äôve never been this lonely in my life.

I haven‚Äôt met a guy that good to me in years, I want this to continue. But our lives are so opposite and he‚Äôs so busy we don‚Äôt get to see each other a lot lately. He‚Äôs not doing anything wrong, I think the relationship is building up in a pretty healthy way, not going too fast nor playing games. Just healthy and honest, down to earth.

But every time I don‚Äôt get news from him for 1 or 2 days, every time he doesn‚Äôt reply to one text or ask me how I am doing, I drowning back to old habits and become really obsessive.

I think about it 24/7, eat tons of Xanax, and although I managed to avoid these toxic behaviors and keep it together until now, I feel myself getting closer to the fall. 

We haven‚Äôt properly discussed exclusivity yet even though we implied it of some sort, and he went out last night in another city and slept at a friend‚Äôs house (don‚Äôt know if male or female) and I haven‚Äôt heard anything since. I‚Äôm spiraling, like bad. 

Please tell me this is going to be ok. I am just scared to death he‚Äôll abandon me for someone else. Or just because I‚Äôm not good enough for him. I don‚Äôt have anything tangible against him I just feel in my guts I am about to explode and mess it all up because I am so dependant emotionally. I don‚Äôt look like it and he can‚Äôt guess because I‚Äôm masking it pretty well but I have absolutely zero confidence and it‚Äôs eating me alive. 

I don‚Äôt know what I am asking you. I don‚Äôt want to ruin this. If I hold one tonight I‚Äôll ruin this tomorrow or next week. Please help",bpd_disorder

"I‚Äôll try to keep this short. But context is probably helpful‚Ä¶

I was on Vyvanse, Propranolol, Prestiq, and Latuda. Two weeks ago my med manager switched the Latuda for Abilify and Lamictal. The side effects were hell but I pushed through to my follow appointment. Dr said to immediately discontinue the Prestiq, Abilify and Lamictal. Possible Serotonin Sydrome, go to the ER if things get worse. 

I tell my FP husband and his response was eeehhhhh that makes me nervous, things are bad when you‚Äôre off meds. 

My therapist thought the Vyvanse might be enough. So I was hopeful.

Withdrawals kick in and I go to the ER thinking I‚Äôm literally dying. Find out previous combo caused damage to my heart, I‚Äôm still dealing with side effects and now going through withdrawals. Not dying, but feels like it. I spend all day yesterday and the day before sleeping it off. 

Dinner time yesterday comes and husband asks what I had planned to make. I tell him it‚Äôs pretty involved so I‚Äôll just take care of it. (This is after listening to him bitch about having to clean up the house and take care of everything because I wasn‚Äôt keeping up on it). Ensue fight. 

He texts me later that night to let me know this is exactly why he didn‚Äôt want me going off meds. üíî

So now I‚Äôm physically feeling better but I‚Äôm destroyed emotionally. I felt like he was the one being rude and who started the fight but no, everything is always my fault and now that I‚Äôm not heavily medicated any emotions I feel or display will be attributed to that and completely disregarded. 

I feel like I have to medicated to the point it‚Äôs literally killing me for him to be happy. I‚Äôm not ok being me, I have to be perfect and numb and never make waves. Otherwise I‚Äôm just a crazy dramatic bitch who makes everyone miserable. 

I wish he understood what his words mean to me as my FP. It guts me when he‚Äôs unhappy with me. And now I feel I have to be sick and overly medicated for him to be happy.",bpd_disorder
"Since I entered my teens I've always worried about the future or about anything that's related to social life. Like I always wanted to be certain of the outcomes even before starting doing something. Being interested in a field was not enough reason for me to do a degree because I wasn't sure it'd give me the life I wanted. Or meeting a nice girl who had an interest in me wasn't enough for me bc I was worried that it would be unfair to get in a relationship where I'm not sure it'd be long term. Because of that I spent almost all my years (I'm 30 now) alone and had very little sex in my life, despite the fact that I long for intimacy and for fulfilling my desires.  
 I had all opportunities to build an amazing life for myself but I never trusted the future or was worried about something. I spent most of my time being home, being alone, analyzing myself like it's my duty. I have a journal with records of all my days for the past 9 years.  


Now I think this is a learnt behaviour. Somehow I also have another face, where I am spontaneous. I always experience that when I am around kids. I love playing with them, coming up with games for them and seeing them being interested in what I'm telling them. Same with animals and nature in general.

"So I was my ex in April. He witnessed my episodes the trauma, the lot. 

He witnessed me get sewersidal and break my hand against my wardrobe. 

He knows about the childhood trauma I've endured, my drug addiction which I used to deal with the memories. 

We broke up because he kept triggering me. He told me I should of got over my illness by now. 

So I broke up with him because I split so bad. 

I managed to break up with him on goodish terms. 

However. I still have him on Instagram and he posted 2 things that have made me feel horrible and anxious. 
1. Something about having trauma and getting into a relationship unhealed. You should get into a relationship for it to add to your already perfect life basically. 

2. A post about magic mushroom being natural and people shouldn't be scared of them. He can't believe people would do pills but not magic mushrooms. 

(I told him I couldn't do psychedelics because I hallucinate and get paranoid when I smoked weed. I told him this when we're together and  He knows about drug addiction the pills) 

I am three years clean by the way.

"One of my codependency traits is introducing people to people so everyone gets along. This sometimes backfires as those people will start hanging out without me.

I notice this happens way more often with my friends who don‚Äôt get out much. Since I‚Äôm observant I pay attention to who might get along well with someone else and I suppose I‚Äôm the ‚Äúglue‚Äù. At first I mean well, but never fails that often they go off on their own or couple up.

Hello everyone. I was officially diagnosed ‚Äúborderpolar‚Äù in rehab when I was getting clean from meth. I just had a couple questions to see if I‚Äôm alone and to see if anyone has tips for some control.

"We borderlines tend to make situations go from minor to serious and even life threatening at times. I think this behavior comes from the belief that as adults, all our problems are serious and need to be handled in such a way. However, this isn't true, not for us or anyone. Big feelings are not always big situations.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say for example, your partner did something ""minor"" that triggered a big feeling. 

In this scenario, 

* your partner promised you that they will pick you up from the gym (which takes 5 minutes)
* however, they are playing a long video game at home. 
* You get annoyed because now you have to wait way longer, you told them you had to sleep early tonight but...
* they made you aware they were playing a game earlier but...you didn't know they couldn't pause it and you had to wait for them to finish. 
* You are now upset, your brain told you ""see, they would rather play a game and leave you waiting, they know you had to sleep early, they don't care about your needs, they lied to you"" --&gt; Cue big feelings

Although you're upset this is entirely a miscommunication error as your partner assumed when they told they are playing a game, that you had to wait till they finish a round. You did not. 

 There are a few ways to cope with this:

&amp;#x200B;

**OPTION A: TAKING YOUR EMOTIONS SERIOUSLY**

You: I know you said that but you could've told me you had to wait, that felt like important information

Partner: Yea, my bad. Is it alright for you to wait longer?

You: I feel really upset right now, I just want to cry. Just feels like you didn't care enough about me to drop the game and come by. I told you I had to sleep earlier and you could've told me about the game 

Partner: I'm sorry but I have to finish this game...Are you feeling ok?

You: NO I feel awful. I know it's not okay for me to feel this way but I can't help it

You: \*thinking\* *great, I'm throwing a fit and stressing them out, why do I feel this way?! I told them but both of us are feeling like shit now.* 

Now both people are stressed out, you are gaslighting yourself with negative self talk. Commence the spiral. You are attending to your feelings but, it seems like it made matters worse.

&amp;#x200B;

**OPTION B:**

Partner: I mean it's just an extra 40 minutes, you can't wait a little longer?

You: \*thinking\* *Great, they're right, why am I making this such a big deal? I'm so mentally ill and fucking toxic. I need to suck it up*

You: I guess I can. 

You are stressed out, your partner is not but they are not aware that they hurt your feelings. You are not attending to your feelings, and neither is your partner. How do you think this is going to play out? Cue the splitting. 

&amp;#x200B;

**OPTION C: USING COMEDY: ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR FEELINGS BUT BEING AWARE** 

You: You said you'd be here and I have to wait a whole hour?!

Partner: Yea this round is going to take that long, sorry I'm going to come as soon as it's done.

You: But you didn't tell me it would take that long and I have to make sure I sleep early today

Partner: Sorry, I didnt tell you that but if you wanted to leave now you needed to tell me an hour earlier

You: No. u dont care about me. u didnt even bother to read my mind and u shouldve known to come earlier.

Partner: LOL honey I will come please, next time just tell me an hour earlier 

You: hmph

&amp;#x200B;

Now what happens here is that 

1. you attended your feelings
2. addressed what giant beliefs are triggering those feelings ('they don't care about me"") that are triggering a giant reaction, 
3. You analyze your beliefs and you are aware that those beliefs aren't true (""they still care about me, I just need to notify an hour earlier"") 
4. you are using satire to let your partner know ""hey I am upset right now, it felt like you didn't care about me but i know you still do"" 

Light situations call for light-hearted solutions!

&amp;#x200B;

Remember you can still handle this situation seriously in a healthy manner, but I wanted to show how comedy can be very effective. Remember if you do not feel better after using this, then you still need to try other forms of coping. Simple requests such as reassurance, hugs, or having your partner do acts of care (have them pick up food for you on the way) is fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Borderline feelings often means you'll react largely towards ""small"" moments. It's inevitable that we are drama queens/kings, but instead of pretending we're not or making every moment dramatic, allow humor to make it light hearted. Your partner can easily comfort you and feel less stressed out since the situation is not heavy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Remember in times of situations where it can be stressful, heavy and hard, it is also the same opportunities of where it can be a moment that heals you and bonds you and your partner closer.",bpd_disorder

"Hey guys, this is my first post. I feel like I just can't fix my problems. Therapy doesn't help me long term. I can't stick to plans. My sleep routine is fucked, I almost never wash my laundry, the thought of doing any small task like washing the dishes is mentally exhausting. I haven't cooked in a week probably. I also hate eating and I suffer when I try to eat. My bf or my mum takes care of everything.

Socializing is difficult for me. I have one friend and I feel very alone. I'm sad that I can't find more friends. I think many people would like to be friends with me but I feel disconnected from them. I feel like something is wrong with me. Why can't I get attached to anyone? I don't think you can force yourself to like someone.

I get jealous when I see people that might have more severe depression than me having loving connections with multiple friends and I feel miserable over seeing their 100 likes on Instagram photos. (I know most people would consider this childish.) I'm mentally like a teen that wants to be popular and be invited to cool parties since I never had that life.

I'm usually late for everything, time management isn't a skill that I have. I have only ""graduated"" from middle school. I am currently not working or studying, I've been retired for a couple of years and I'm only 24 years old. I don't really have an idea what I would study if I was able to. I mostly try to do things require little effort like being on my phone unable to stop reading about stuff even when it brings me anxiety.

I invalidate my depression and every struggle I have because I'm not suicidal. I have bpd and ocd as my diagnoses and I think I might be on the autistim spectrum but I would have to quit smoking weed for 3 months if I wanted to get tested.

I can barely stand to be alone for a day. Something that might help me is if I was supervised 24/7 and forced to take care of myself. I can easily manipulate people to do things for me. Someone needs to tell me to do it on my own.

I feel like my only escape would be drugs. Alcohol makes me worse so I drink rarely. I smoke weed almost every day but I feel like it's not enough. I think I could fix some things if I tried psilocybin and I'm planning to do that when I get to.

Sorry it's a long. I just felt like I need some support and maybe advice, even though I think nothing is going to help me.",bpd_disorder

He always seems to want to just leave and go somewhere, there's always something else to do, which makes me even more upset and feel like I'm just not important enough to stay with. Like he doesn't love me or want me, there's always something or someone else and I'm fighting to be chosen and loved all the time. When i notice he's trying to leave, which I've become extremely sensitive to perceiving, i just can't help but start crying, blubbering, apologizing for being so annoying, apologizing that i can't just seemingly give him what he wants and just accept him running off suddenly. Then when he does leave I'm alone and feel abandoned, unloved, unwanted, unimportant, and i just hate myself for causing another fuss and end up moping for days. I just want him to choose me. This is probably wrapped up in my abandonment issues. I don't know. our relationship is extremely complicated for the past three years because of choices he continues to make and I'm trying to hold onto him but I'm really disappointed, and the complications have made all of my issues 1000000x worse. I hope i tagged this right, I'm not looking for advice i just wondered if this made sense to anyone else or if yall could relate. thanks x",bpd_disorder
"I don‚Äôt want to be a burden, or more of one but he‚Äôs really the only person I can actually talk to‚Ä¶I‚Äôm on a wait list for therapy so I don‚Äôt have that yet. But it‚Äôs like, what is he supposed to do about it? We‚Äôre in an LDR so it‚Äôs not like he can come comfort me or anything. I just feel really selfish. 

I‚Äôve been trying to do other things‚Ä¶journaling, using other tools like my nails instead of something sharp but it‚Äôs wearing off and the urge is still there",bpd_disorder
"When I drink I drink too much and say stupid shit.

But anyways I was at my friends house and for some reason we decide to go around and say our unpopular opinions. My friends bf says his is that trans women shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to compete in womens sports.

Well, that shit really set me off. To me that sounds like a very thinly veiled attempt at saying ‚Äútrans women are not real women‚Äù. And also, I‚Äôve done research on this topic, and I know that the ‚Äúbiological differences‚Äù in the sexes is largely negated once trans women are own hormone blockers / estrogen, not to mention that biological different occur within the same sex, anyways, like Michael Phelps bendy body.

So anyways I go off on this, which embarrasses me because his other unpopular opinion is that ‚Äúpeople get too triggered these days‚Äù. So I guess I‚Äôm the triggered one but really I‚Äôm pissed off because his opinions feels really uneducated and dangerous.

But this was supposed to be a safe space to talk through our unpopular opinions and I left feeling like I overdid it and I feel wierd now and like my friends hate me. :/",bpd_disorder
"we‚Äôve literally been talking for a week but everything feels perfect about them. couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about them every single minute since last night and legit currently still am. I finally convinced myself to sleep but woke up 3 hours later after what I think was a dream or thought of them. wtf is wrong with me, I don‚Äôt want to get too attached again to where I become insane and want to break boundaries but I already feel it evolving. how do i control my thoughts and behave and feel like a normal person. these feelings are literally overwhelming and exhausting.",bpd_disorder
"Does anyone else feel intensely itchy to the point where they can‚Äôt even function and have meltdowns when you‚Äôre in an unfamiliar place?. I‚Äôm travelling home after work and this route makes me feel really itchy to the point where I have to stop in the street and breath in and out, to stop myself from scratching myself and screaming out loud. Before I thought it was because I didn‚Äôt have music, usually if I‚Äôm walking without any headphones, I become extremely distressed and hyper aware of my surroundings and itchy. But for some reason it‚Äôs surpassed this and now I‚Äôm here scratching trying not to bug out. I‚Äôd really appreciate it if you could put your theories down and help me figure this out.",bpd_disorder
"Cw: mention of suicidal ideation / self harm 

Last night after some minor drama with my favorite person, I went out at night with water and a pill bottle and took pills. I know I should not have logically done this. I still feel sick this morning, but I'll be okay. 

I have never actually acted on these thoughts until last night so that makes me think that I need to talk to someone and find help urgently. I just don't know who to turn to, because I do not have insurance currently so it's not as if I can admit myself to inpatient. At least not without getting my family info severe medical debt.

I feel like my impulsivity is the primary symptom that, when combined with emotional instability, poses an actual danger to my well being.

The scariest part is that I feel like doing it again tonight. I know I should not and I need to be willing to accept help. I *want* help, I just don't know where to find it. My brain keeps telling me that hotlines won't do anything, especially after my last experience with it. 

Thank you for reading, sorry if this was a lot.",bpd_disorder
