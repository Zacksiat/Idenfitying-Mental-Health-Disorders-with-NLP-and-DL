"After taking Zoloft for a week and experiencing a lot of manic symptoms, my psychiatrist deduced that I have bipolar disorder. This was after the fact that I told her about previous manic episodes and other information I provided for her, of course. Iâ€™ll be starting on seroquel 25 mg for 3 days, upping to 50 mg a night after that. My psych said that it is temporary and that I will switch to a different medication (or add a med but Iâ€™m not completely sure) soon after starting seroquel.

Itâ€™s just funny to me, because the only reason I sought out therapy and a psychiatrist was for an ADHD consultation. I was first medicated due to my extreme levels of depression and anxiety that Iâ€™ve been experiencing since I was 12/13 years old. Now it turns out that I have bipolar disorder.

Iâ€™m happy to be figuring myself out, but my god this is scarier than I thought. A lot of research ahead.",bipolar_disorder

"I am a 19M, it's actually my birthday tomorrow funnily enough...

I have gone my whole life dealing with every single symptom of BPD. It's become such a normal thing that I just never questioned it. Infact when I was younger I DID try telling my parents about it, but I was quickly dismissed for being ""dramatic"". Well the last few days I have been digging deeper into my emotions and tendencies, only to find every checkmark ticked. 

I'm not going to lie, I'm scared. What if I really am overreacting? I've told my best friend my suspicions and he has grown increasingly distant. I'm supposed to go in for a walk in appointment on Monday to be diagnosed I suppose, but I'm just really worried that I AM faking it.

Does anyone have any suggestions for me? This is my first time being open with this so I apologize if it's off-putting",bipolar_disorder
"Not sure if this will be allowed by the sub rules. If you're in Sydney, I generally go fishing in a tinny on a Sunday morning (with an aim to be getting onto the water just before dawn). Until December I had a perfect record of zero fish caught since starting again in 2020.

Easily worked out from my post history but:

* I'm male, 50 years of age
* Have bipolar2, ADHD and PTSD induced chronic depression (all now medicated and ramping up to correct levels)

I'll provide the gear (including life jackets). I can even prepare some hookless rigs if you really would rather pretend than actually try catch fish. I prefer to feed them and mostly catch and release. I'm in the Hills district and put the boat in at Apple Tree bay. 

DM me if interested. This isn't an offer to take you fishing every weekend (its my recovery time) but I'd be happy to have some company some weekends.",bipolar_disorder

I was fine (or thought I was). Anyway, this is where I get stupid and why I am now crying and basically I hate myself (No surprise) Anyway called my hook up asked for cuddles and he said no because I was ""asking for too much"".

"I got prescribed prozac for ""anxiety"" but it sent me into a super manic depressive state. So much so that I couldn't tell my dreams from reality and sort of attempted suicide but not really. I don't think I was actually gonna go through with it but I seriously had the urge to do so for the first time. My doctor said it's likely cuz I'm bipolar. But I've never had a episode of feeling elevated and like I could do anything. My mood mostly consists of feeling like shit to feeling sort of alright but still shitty. Are any of you guys like me? Oh and I was also smokin a lot of weed at the time. I'm putting the suicidal thoughts trigger cuz I don't wanna fuck someone up but this is really a general question. Thanks peeps.",bipolar_disorder

"Diagnosed bipolar earlier this year. Still figuring all this out butâ€¦.anxiety? Iâ€™ve always been an anxious person. However, I seem to be extra anxious lately. Nothing has really changed in my life except Iâ€™m working less because Iâ€™m afraid to go to work. 

I seem to be more anxious about work than Iâ€™ve ever been. I took two weeks off because Iâ€™m so anxious. Itâ€™s developing into a real fear to where my heart races just when I think about going to work the next week. Itâ€™s becomingâ€¦crippling. Im try my best to not smoke weed to chill or drink to numb. 

Every time I have a bad day at work it just makes me more afraid to go back. It just keeps building and building and it feels insurmountable. Iâ€™ve never had it this bad and I have no idea what to do. Unfortunately quitting this job is not possible for another 6 months. I wait tables and people are so mean and judgmentalâ€¦.theyâ€™re cruel, really. The job is constantly chaotic, disorienting, and extremely stressful. I just want to drink myself to death as soon as I get home. 

 What if I make a mistake again? 
What if someone gets mad at me?
What if my manager thinks my tip percentage is too low?
What if my manager thinks im the biggest idiot here and secretly hates my guts?
What if I am stupid? Everyone else can handle this..
What if they fire be because Iâ€™m so stupid?

"I was hospitalised in 2019 just after I turned 18 for an acute psychotic episode with mania and gradiouse beliefs. 

I was later diagnosed with depressive bipolar disorder and have been taking meds for nearly three years now. 

However, I have become very depressed recently. I have regular traumatic flashbacks and I am absolutely terrified of being noticed in public by people that might know who I am / what happened to me.

Anyone who has been hospitalised or has had psychosis can I have some reassurance that I'm not going mad?

"I just need to rant because my BPD2 is winning right now.

"So I've been smoking a LOT of weed lately and at first it was to help me but now I think it's adding to my disorder (bipolar 1). It's expensive and not fun anymore but I can't seem to stop. I'll even be asking myself ""why"" as I'm packing a bowl.

My aunt offered for me to cat/house sit for two weeks in Montana (I'm from Arizona) and I agreed because why not? So I'm 3 days in now with no smoking and I feel good? I'm starting to dream again and feel super social.

THAT BEING SAID I am concerned it may be the start of a manic swing however, I've been severely depressed since June. Every day of the summer was a fight. Anyway, regardless of whether it's my mind clearing up or a manic episode in my future I feel very excited to feel again.

"So I'm 20 years old and was diagnosed when I was 15 and in the hospital. I have been on different medications since I was 13 for depression and anxiety. After I had a huge manic episode that definitely almost ruined my life (thank god I was still a minor and able to make it out of my mess with no big consequences, I was then diagnosed with bipolar 1 and put on lexipro and Latuda. It worked great for a long time. The biggest downside was feeling like an emotionless robot tbh. Things that should've made me sad, didn't affect me. I was never really happy or sad or angry, just here. Once I turned 18 I was kicked out and have been bouncing from place to place since then. Most of my jobs have been through temp services and don't offer medical insurance. I haven't been on any meds for about a year and a half now. I just can't afford it at all.

"I started off the year in a psychosis and really messed up. I spent a few days lost in my head and my delusions and literally spent the days driving around, being an idiot and speeding. I drove close to 1500 miles in 4 days. Well I managed to get caught by a cop and pulled over for speeding. I was also smoking a joint at the time and got hit with a DUI. Thankfully I keep my delusions in my head and don't talk about them so they didn't know I wasn't all there so I didn't get sent to the pysch ward. They just threw me in jail for a few days before I was able to pay the bail. Now I feel like my life is ruined. I never expected this to happen to me, I normally am a safe driver and don't speed. I also don't smoke either but during this episode I thought it was okay and wouldn't mess with my head for some reason.


I have been feeling like a complete failure since this happened and feel into a depressive pit. I'm also unemployed so now I have to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a lawyer, DUI courses, and my license is suspended. This is really going to make it so much more difficult to get a job than it already has been. I guess like a lot of us, I've had trouble keeping a job and have some gaps between employment but now this? I can't see myself ever getting a decent job again. I also told the only friend I have an tried to vent to him and guess what... he now avoids me. I just want to sleep for the rest of the year.",bipolar_disorder

"It gets better, everyone.

For years I left my illness unmedicated. Destroyed relationships, phones, and of course, frying my brain like an egg with drugs and mania. Decided to get help after I destroyed the most valuable relationship in my life. A little too late.

Now I'm on meds and am generally doing better. After a whole year though I'm still making adjustments.

 I was so so so so excited to get my degree... It sent me into an episode, completely schizoaffective, but this time I was on the meds. Stabilized within a week (thank you Latuda and Abilify, sorry mom) and am feeling better again.

I finally did it. I was taken by ambulance to the hospital in February last year for something I tried doing to myself. My dads insurance paid for only a tiny part of it.

"So from what I understand there are officially two diagnostic categories for bipolar disorder which are defined quite specifically.

However while trying to understand whether or not I might have bipolar disorder I have talked to a few friends diagnosed with bipolar and a few friends who have questioned whether they might be bipolar.

From what my friends have said it often seems like it's really common not to really fit neatly into the diagnostic criteria. For example I have two friends with type two bipolar disorder who have experienced a full blown manic episode under unusual circumstances. One of them often has hypomanic episodes that only last one day. There are also edge cases where people have some bipolar traits but not enough to meet the diagnostic criteria.

I'm normally depressed but under unusual circumstances I've had a couple of 2-3 day long hypomanic episodes. It's possible that I've had more but I don't remember very well. I had psychosis (or something close to it) once years ago but no mania. I have some 'risk factors' including ADHD and a bipolar family member. It's not quite enough to get a diagnosis but I feel like it's close. Sort of like I have potential for hypomania to become a cyclic thing but it hasn't so far.

I was kind of stressing about whether or not I have bipolar disorder until I learned that it seems like it's actually pretty common to be kind of an 'edge case' with apparently [40% of Americans with major depression having had a manic or hypomanic episode](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=118977). There's also cyclothymia, [depressive episodes with short duration hypomania](https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/depressive-episodes-with-short--duration-hypomania-dsm--5), and apparently various other subtypes of bipolar.

It also seems like there may be hereditary connections between major depression, bipolar, and psychosis/schizophrenia?

I was reminded of the autistic spectrum (i.e. the range of different ways autism can manifest). Previously in the DSM autism had a few different subtypes such as Asperger's syndrome and PDD-NOS but under further study they were considered to be quite difficult to distinguish from one another and had so much overlap that they were collated into a single diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder.

I'm wondering if the concept of ""spectrum"" could be similarly applied to bipolar disorder and its related conditions. What do you think?",bipolar_disorder
"I would probably be a lot better off if I had a ""conservatorship"" in my 20s but at least I understand my illness now and I know what the rules are of staying well with bipolar (and how the illness can burn you badly if you're not following the rules).

"Hello all,

I have been in love with my friend for a while ago, about a year now, I think. We have known each other for five years and I honestly never thought he would be the one but I started to think about him all the time, and we would talk on the phone every night. A few months ago I really accepted that I love him and I want to be with him. I talked about him all the time to everyone, I wrote so many words in my diary about him and how much I love everything about him. I was thinking about him all the time and wanted to talk with him all the time. I secretly fantasized about being in a relationship with him, getting to call him my boyfriend and for him to call me his girlfriend, and doing domestic things together all the time. I did things like keep the spare pillow he used on my bed, and kept his phone charger on my wall from the time he stayed over, pretending that they were there because we were together and he lived with me. I wanted to always dress up nicely for him and shower him with gifts. I really felt feelings for him. 

One week ago I asked him to be my boyfriend. He said yes and he said he has actually liked me for a long time, since we first met. The problem is that since that day I have been feeling completely numb inside. I feel barely any love or happiness. It started when I woke up that morning. I had planned to give him flowers, I knew I should be feeling excited but I didn't feel much. I felt so worried that whole day because I didn't feel happy, but I didn't feel sad, I just felt no emotions. I started crying after the first time we kissed each other. I thought it would go away after a few days but it hasn't. I've felt nothing except numbness or anger (not related to him). I don't feel like myself at all. I feel like an alien or robot. Like I'm not even human anymore. I feel like I'm an intruder who got swapped with the ""real"" me and I have to just remember and recite what she likes, or what she would say. 

Has anyone else had an experience like this where you just suddenly shut off from your feelings? Am I just getting used to things? Am I maybe feeling shocked because of this big change in my life? Am I just having an episode? Is it my medications? I can't stop thinking about it. I'm so scared that I don't actually love him or something. I'm so scared because he loved me all this time, I finally tell him yes, I don't want to have to tell him that  it's actually a no. I couldn't live with myself. And I want to love him so bad. I just want my feelings to come back. I'm so afraid. Someone please help me.",bipolar_disorder

"So here it goes. I am 23 years old, and I have no friends.

I just started seeing a therapist 2 weeks ago. I got a new job, and I just started going back to college and I have 5 semesters left. 

I have no one to talk to except my father, mother, and two younger brothers who are 19 and 17. 

I recently noticed everyone getting annoyed by me because I talk too much and always want to share what Iâ€™m interested in. 

I even ask about them like their day, or what theyâ€™re interested in, or just try to talk about them since I have no one to talk to and they donâ€™t care. 

So today I finally snapped. No one wanted to answer my calls, no one wanted to respond to my text, and no one wanted to even just sit in the living room and watch tv with me. I even said Iâ€™ll watch what they want to watchâ€¦

So I just sent them a text and said â€œIâ€™m tired of me always hitting you guys up and none of you ever responding or even messaging me firstâ€.

So starting today Iâ€™m gonna leave them alone and stop texting or calling them.

I have been planning my Death day for my birthday for the past few years and this month I have chosen not to go through with it.

To put this into context, I have mild to moderate depression always and episodes of severe, debilitating anxiety with panic attacks. This state will sometimes stay 24/7 for a few days or weeks and then change to â€žsome hours normal if I manage to distract myself and some still very badâ€œ.

Around two months or so ago I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 and my GP put me on Seroquel with the intention of gradually reducing the Resperidone. 
I then had a manic episode and my GP put me on 500mg of lithium with bloods being at 0.38 after two weeks. 
Heâ€™s now upped my dose to 750mg.
I just saw a psychiatrist this morning and he has suggested that once my blood is in therapeutic range, to gradually come off Seroquel &amp; Resperidone.

she died in a car accident, on impact death. we are both recently 19. it's a weird situation. we weren't close, but we talked daily and about deep things but we just weren't super close. we hung out at each other's apartment and went to class and parties together. we talked last night, about school starting Monday and upcoming college parties. we were best friends in elementary, middle, high school, and college, but in the way that if we had class together and would have deep talks about our family and life and reminisce on our past growing up in a small town. we talked outside of school daily, but they were base level and most gossip talks.

I was just listening to a song today and thinking about our pregame at her apartment and listening to it while someone drove us to a party. it was the first time i really lived and did something crazy in college. she helped me live. we laughed so hard about the past and planned for craziness in the future. her life was very messy. she was a day drinker and alcoholic and ran with messy people, but it never crossed my mind that something like a car accident that wasn't her fault would kill her so soon. I'm not ready for the funeral if there is one. I'm not ready for school or work. I'm not ready to put this into prospective and maybe that's why I can't.

I don't know how to put into words what our friendship was, but it doesn't matter much now I don't think.",bipolar_disorder

"I only got my diagnosis earlier this year and it took a few months of titration with meds before I really felt balanced.

I never researched too much about bipolar (pre diagnosis) because I didnâ€™t want to fall down the rabbit hole of self diagnosis, so the last few months has been a wealth of new discovery for me (esp via this sub when someone will post about a certain aspect and I can deeply relate to it).

I also tend to make self deprecating jokes, which my whole family does as well. I hear itâ€™s an Aussie thing. 

Anyway long story long, my partner and daughter have taken to rolling their eyes in a â€here we go againâ€œ manner if I mention bipolar.

"Ive always thought i had bipolar, but everyone Ive brought it up to says its normal to have mood swings/not be happy all the time but it feels like more than that.

Most of the time Im just depressed but i remember having manic episodes more when i was in middle and high school, my parents would scold me (for being too wild)and ask if i was on drugs. I would pull all-nighters, i bought several pets i had no business owning, i would drive crazy, go on 10 mile runs, cut my own hair in the middle of the night, get into physical fights, and then crash and regret everything. Ive also lost many friends by starting fights or ignoring out of depression and ive struggled with SH since 7th grade. 

Im now 25 and just got off of Lexapro because it caused a manic episode, i asked my physiatrist about mood stabilizers but she said shes â€œnot convincedâ€ i need them and prescribed me anxiety meds that arent helping at all. And now im sad and confused. 

So i guess im askingâ€¦am i being dramatic by thinking i might have bipolar? I feel almost embarrassed to bring it up with my doctor again because theyâ€™ll probably say its normal or not enough evidence.

"Hi,

I also am an aspie, so please don't think I'm being obtuse in understanding this social situation!

Basically, became massively infatuated with someone, which triggered both a mixed episode and my psych deciding to concurrently diagnose me with BPD. (He knows I have bipolar as he witnessed the mixed episode and knows about an OD I took lately. )

I asked him why he'd been so distanced, and he said something about us being in different places, and, when pressed, that, since he heard I had feelings for him and am a colleague in a vulnerable position, he'd taken a step back.

I understand he is not interested in me romantically. But does his response mean there is zero attraction? A part of me hopes he doesn't think I'm disgustingly ugly, but believes it's inappropriate for the reasons he mentioned. I understand you're not mind readers, but I can't ask him for clarification, so was please hoping for some answers?

Thank you!",bipolar_disorder

I got myself in a bad situation which could've been much worse and it was all due to mania from lack of sleep and food and starting from routine.

"**Background**: Eight months ago, I was involuntarily hospitalized with grandiose manic delusions. I thought I was both Jesus and Batman, and wanted to marry my car. 

Despite no desire to self-harm or intention to harm others, the way I was driving was enough to declare me a danger...

So I joined the grippy sock club and was discharged with a script for 1200mg Lithium. 

I'm stable now. But stable is a misleading word. There's so many things I wish I could do but find myself unable to start. I *hate* that people like us are overrepresented in jails, in drug rehab, and where even *stable* means being loaded up on expensive meds.


**Today**:
I want my first episode to be my only. But for this to happen for me, I need to understand *how* I became deluded. And to that end, 
I've reactivated my 3 old Twitter handles from the depths of my psychosis, and what I will say is they are uneasy friends at best. 

While I, and I need to *emphasize* now, I am medicated and stable, with a psychiatrist and therapist and strong friends and family to fall back on... I have already been able to produce psychotic features of my own volition. I'm learning to understand the same experiences as symptoms instead of external ""signs"" that drove my delusions. 


I'm excited to do this self-exploration and to be documenting it all to the best of my ability online. 

If any of this is of interest to you, you can certainly follow along. You'd probably want to start with [The Austonian](https://twitter.com/AustonianC),  they're the most meta of the bunch, and they do still contain my old scribblings as a bonus, if you scroll far enough.

I told him about an ideation i was having of hurting someone else. He tried to say "" you dont wanna think like that, is this person that bad? Im sure they're an ok person""

What? That's why I'm here today, because i dont want to get in trouble, or make another manic decision that i need to pick the pieces up afterwards.

So what did i do? I punched the handsanitizer thing, broke it. I feel horrible. I just stormed out of the hospital, and tried to chill. But i couldn't. So i went home.

It's not other people's responsibility to make sure im acting in healthy ways. This is not me, and when im manic, im easily triggered. I feel bad. This is my illness, and i hate that it effects others so much. I feel really trapped.

"I guess I'm seeking advice or would like to hear what has worked for people regarding this. As someone with bipolar I have a unique dependency with aspects of my routine and oftentimes an extreme sensitivity to stress. After years of stability, honestly, I am entirely convinced that it is 100% impossible for ""normal"" people to wrap their head around this. There is often a certain rigidity that I need to hold over certain things such as meals, meditation practice, down time, time to get things done, lights out time... and to someone without bipolar disorder that tends to sound absolutely preposterous.

With my family I can just walk away, seek my own space, and do my own thing. But with a significant other there is an aspect of emotion and sharing of space that is not a part of all my other relationships. There is pressure to meet certain emotional needs and this pressure to just ""loosen up a little bit"" at times. Like I don't have enough of a hard time already! I often WANT to abandon my routine and do whatever I want whenever I want; I want to blow things off and procrastinate and cast aspects of routine aside for that sake. It's hard to be healthy.

My significant other is wonderful and we have a very healthy relationship, but of course there are times that she doesn't realize how much of a ""distraction"" she can be or when there is that pressure to cater to emotion. When I communicate that, of course there are times that she may take it personally. Sometimes she is unaware when she pushes me to loosen up a bit, and sometimes I do. That's on me, not on her. Of course that comes with consequences, and when she sees that she recognizes it and learns how to support and meet my needs better in that regard.

Overall, she is a very receptive and wonderful partner. I couldn't ask for anything more from her. She does her part and is always striving for growth in playing that role just a little bit better. I commit to doing the same on my end. We strive for that together, and I take pride in that.

I've got a car but it needs ~$1000 in repairs, meaning I can't really work atm since Ubering would be crazy expensive and there are no buses that run through our town. I have no family to turn to and have fallen out of touch with most of my friends. I stay home all day doing the same thing every day. Look for jobs -&gt; clean the house -&gt; prepare food for my gf and I. I'm going crazy being stuck home all day for a year, crippled with stress and anxiety for not being able to make money and contribute to our expenses. 

A year ago my mental health was doing well but now i don't even recognize myself anymore. Life truly sucks and my girlfriend is the only one keeping me going.",bipolar_disorder

Recently Iâ€™ve been off meds 1 monthish and I feel my health is deteriorating. I am always sleepy with no energy. I can't wake up and I'm getting dizzy most of the time. I cannot work at all due to the low energy and sleepiness. I haven't showered in days. I know these signs are leading to depression. How do I cope with this. I gained 20kg due to this and I feel like I'm losing my mind.

"Hi, just have a couple of questions to help me understand bipolar better.

Is (hypo)mania:

1. triggered by an event (e.g. a trauma trigger) or does it just come out of the blue?

2. while I understand hypomania needs to last four days or more for diagnosis purposes, can someone with bipolar have shorter periods of hypomania such as just one or two days?",bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™ve  recently been diagnosed with bipolar, but I started seeing my psychiatrist in March. Iâ€™m currently in a manic episode which is the first sheâ€™s seen. She upped my Lithium to 1200 and my Olanzapine to 5mg but Iâ€™m stillon 20mg fluoxetine.

Im feeling an ultimate high, depression and anxiety at the same time. 

At this time my rational side is holding back my impulsivity and god complex. Iâ€™m one bad day away from quitting my job and starting an onlyfans and streaming. 

Why? I donâ€™t know!! I got god complex in my head right now telling me itâ€™ll work out and just do it. But I know itâ€™s just me trying to find an escape from the mundaness of life. But manic part of me is like â€œcome oooon ðŸ˜ letâ€™s do itâ€

"I don't want to go through it again. But I do. Things go flat and for too long. Each day is the same. There are good things that happen most every one but it's still the same day over and over. Wake up and take a quick assesment.....nope not feeling any bit the other direction so be satisfied with that. Prop up and watch the sky get brighter soon it will be completely light out and you'll have to head back into the same day. Try to imagine a life that could be different, to where you don't recognize the redundancy. Pretty sure I always will. Robotic thing. 

For a while it was very real and I thought He would help. Plenty of doubts along the way, having not believed all those years before, but you believed He might help. Not so sure anymore, about any of this. It's faded away so much, that the Creator is the One. I Am Who I Am, so am I, and who I am is just another robot in a redundant life. Was hoping You could help with that. But I'm not so sure anymore. 

I want it to come back, now two things. That strong belief plus those days where I was a part of life. More than a part, set apart. Each day was different and certainly not redundant, but the last time it happened it was the best so far. Is my mind matured to handle the ride now? The last time was so very different. Some moments of grandeur but...just part of something bigger as the redundant pattern that everyone else was in was set apart from me. Crisp, but not chaotic. 

But it never lasts. Back to reality. Back to the pattern. Robotic existence and now He's becoming not-so-real. It's been two summers since my last ride. Wouldn't mind if it came back but I can't say what it will be like. Wasn't working those two summers ago so I could fold into whatever I wanted to. If it came back now I'd probably quit and think everything would work out. Usually doesn't. Been a year and a half since He became real, now that's fading away. Back to just being alive. 

Life could be much worse and I know this. It's been 15 years since my first ride. The next four were pretty crazy, most recent was the best, two summers ago. A dark winter of sorts followed. Not depressed, just lost. Existential stuff, dark night of the soul. Then He showed up in my bedroom one night. A sensation, presence, like I've never experienced before. And haven't since. Been a year and a half since that night and a lot of diving in. But it's faded away and I'm back to watching the sky get bright. Not sure what's real except that the bills need paid that way I can wake up to the same day over and over. Not thinking it will ever be any different at this point. Just here.",bipolar_disorder

"Well that was pretty stupid. Or was it? 

Close call, in a way, not in an arrogant way in saying that, or my beliefs are correct and you're wrong, but my journey into belief almost came to a complete stop. Came at the hands of spending time on one of those Christian subreddit things. Open discussion for all things Christianity related so athiests and agnostics and theists and Satanists and seventh day Adventists and Jehovahs witnesses and....anyone was welcome to post something or comment. Wasn't very civil at times either. A lot of the time. 

I guess it was bound to happen, come across information that denounces Christ and the existence of God. Obviously not something that I'm unaware of, people don't believe Jesus is who he said he was and God doesn't exist. But spending about a month and a half in that community was pretty much like snorting a line of doubt and questioning straight to my brain. No slow trickle of doubts and questioning, not a little jab here and there, just a flood of second guessing. God certainly started fading away in my mind, Christ as well, the night that brought me into belief and the strange things that have happened also quickly became nothing. Pretty stupid to do that to myself not sure why I'm such an idiot sometimes but it was bound to happen - extreme doubt. 

It had to be exponentially easier to step into the path of becoming a believer when the internet wasn't avaliable. Build your faith without a whole lot of conflicting information around. I'm actually 100% certain of that, was easier. I could've just not done that but being the Curious George that I am, went right into the lions den ""Oh Geroge, you so silly. Why did you snort that line of doubt and questioning?"" I dunno. Seemed like the intelligent thing to do. But perhaps the hardest stuff to read was from the ex-Christians. Decades of involvement within the church. If anyone would know that Christianity is a bunch of nonesense it would be those folks. Yea that sucked. Spending time in that place. That online community. 

One of the other discouraging posts I came across was that you can only hear God speak through scriptures. I'm not wanting to ever hear a voice in my head, ever, been through enough inside that place. Nice. Let's add this to my resume - I'm hearing voices inside my head. Noooo thank you. But people claim to have heard God speak to them. Some people hear God speak in other ways. And then yea others say that God only speaks through scriptures. I don't like that opinion, God only speaks through the Bible, mostly because of how I came into initial belief and also that I'm still having a hard time with the Bible. It doesn't seem like God is speaking to me, the words still seem as if man wrote them and are were not written by God, inspired writings. 

The author C.S. Lewis was quoted as saying something along the lines of how he was dragged kicking and screaming into the Kingdom of God. And it came to be that he didn't want to believe, but found himself later that he did. Pretty much where I'm at. If I come to fully believe that Jesus was the Son of God it won't be from brainwashing. I'm fighting this tooth and nail. 

A very high percentage of this adventure hasn't been fun. I'm envious of people who came to belief and pretty much overnight thier lives were enriched. Hasn't been the case for me. But I guess everyone's brain and walk is different and perhaps there's a reason everything has played out this way. Almost Curious George'd my way out of belief. Fun times.",bipolar_disorder

"Saw my [regular] doctor today and was advised to start regularly taking an over-the-counter allergy med such as Claritin or Zyrtec. Everything I already take is in my file (accurately, too, as the nurse who did my vitals updated them for me), so I'm assuming they wouldn't have recommended I take something that would negatively interact with my psych meds. Didn't occur to me to ask before I left, and I tried to search on my own, but couldn't come up with definitive answers.

I sent a message to my psychiatrist asking about possible interactions, but I'm not sure when I'll hear back from them &amp; I'd like to pick up meds as soon as possible because the allergies are, quite frankly, making me fucking miserable/affecting my ability to function.

"So my friend gave me a bunch of organic weed from our friends moms garden. Historically, smoking pot for me is a disaster- it makes me super manic and then I crash hard. I've also tried the whole CDB thing for anxiety with no real luck. 

This strain of pot (alien og) has been like a miracle for me. I smoke it when I'm feeling anxious/obsessive (slightly hypomanic at times) and when I am depressed.  I've been taking BP meds for close to 20 years and haven't experienced any medication giving a similar effect. It's almost like it shuts off a part of my mind thats constantly racing in the background. I can also still work and function. I feel the most calm in my life.

I've been taking like 1-2 small hits almost everyday for 2 months and still no problems. My thinking is it is leveling out my mood states to some degree. But it could be a ticking time bomb of disaster and wont tell my psychiatrist bc he will says bad idea.

Anyone else have a similar experience with weed? What strain? 

***Note I have literally spent decades perfecting my meds. Before the weed I was the most stable i have ever been on meds. I take Lamictal, Seroquel, Gabapentine, Wellbutrin and Vyvanse (damn thats depressing). I in no way encourage anyone to start smoking pot if you aren't first stable on your meds. Even then do it with caution. I am still on 100% of my meds in addition to the weed. I also have smoked pot on and off for years and have never had such an experience.

Usually I feel pretty irritable the next day, but my mood was actually quite a bit better and I was the most productive if been in months.

"So I am fully aware this is a phase of my cycling and that the anger, while at times warranted, is blown out of proportion by the bipolar. That just ticks me off more. I feel like Iâ€™m never actually allowed to be mad because either itâ€™s a part of the cycle or Iâ€™m making too big of a deal out if it in terms of reaction. But I am mad and I have good reason to be madâ€¦I think anyways. My 8y/o gets up for school and typically wakes me up (I am on disability and have a sleep disorder) I donâ€™t always get up the first or even second time unfortunately.

Called my Dr and she told me to up my dose and those side effects should disappear. I took that 3mg dose around 5 hours ago and I am already feeling uncomfortable and jittery again.

"I donâ€™t even know what I am feeling anymore. Last night I went to sleep trying to ignore the creepy crawly feeling under my skin. I havenâ€™t been sleeping well. Monday didnâ€™t sleep till 7:30amâ€¦..up all night. Worked all weekend. Pulled a 45 hour shift in 3 days. Sick with a respiratory infection. Canâ€™t breathe. Canâ€™t sleep. Canâ€™t stop thinking. Nonstop thinking. Itâ€™s all over the map.
Strange, my whole life Iâ€™ve had cycles like this. I never had a name for it though. Now, there are so many diagnoses on my chart I feel like a textbook. 
I tend to have a large reaction even to minor events or incidences. My anxiety is an instigator that feeds my depressive episodes. And my mania makes my anxiety worse because then Iâ€™m left thinking â€œwhat the hell am I doing? How far will we go this time? Where will we book a trip to? How much of my money will I blow on crystals? Am I going to buy  another car? How are we supposed to bounce back from this?â€ 
Honestly, I can handle the mania. Mixed episodes I cannot. That feeling of laughing so hard but really you were crying the whole time as well. The extreme joy but incredibly dark blue as well. The needing to jump. Literally I just get up and shake a while because itâ€™s so much. 
I recently found out summer can trigger maniaâ€¦..interesting. It was always my favorite season. The heat, the water, the smell, the salt, the sweat. Also, summer was when I sleep the least. When Fall shows up, it brings such a sense of relief. Like, yes, now I can sleepâ€¦â€¦.

"Skip to last paragraph if you don't want to read backstoryðŸŒ¸

Hi all, I'm looking for tips on how to feel full and satisfied after eating a meal. These days I have a terrible habit of binging and most of tbe time purging after because I feel so guilty. I have always struggled with my body image, especially because growing up I had multiple family members always telling me to watch what I eat and telling me that my portion sizes would make me the size of a house, or that I would end up like my mom, who is a little overweight (yes they really would tell me that). 

At the time I didn't understand but in hindsight my portion sizes were not excessive and I had pleasure from food. But all of these nasty comments in combination with social media and societal standards deeply warped my perception of myself and food itself.

Eventually I found myself in love with the gym in highschool and ate very healthy a majority of the time and would still indulge in treats. My relationship with myself and food was finally reaching a healthy place, until circumstances pulled me away from the gym. It was heart wrenching to be away from what was my escape from the world and my problems.

This, in addition to being in abusive relationships, led me down a dark path of food restriction. For an entire year I would limit myself to about 500 calories a day and nonstop caffiene, and would be fine eating a lollipop as a meal. It became almost impossible to even finish a breakfast biscuit from McDonald's because I would get so full. This continued on into college with a slight progression of eating more. I tried to get back into the gym but was very discouraged because I had been out for so long it felt like starting at square one again. I was on and off with going to the gym as covid kept opening and shutting down the gym.

I eventually found myself out of two abusive relationships and hitting the gym more often. I was tolerant of myself and even made the decision to finally get help for my mental health which I've struggled with all my life.

However, once I started psych meds that all went through the window. I did okay for awhile but at one point I just absolutely spiraled and lost myself. All I did was smoke weed and feel sorry for myself because my life felt such a mess. I eventually put myself in a treatment facility and ""graduated"" with the self help tools I needed.

But along the way, my relationship with food was obliterated. In combination with my psych meds *which are notorious for crazy weight gain* and now an insatiable desire to eat, and eat, and eat (probably to make myself feel better) I've gained at least 40 lbs in the span of 6 months. 

So now I feel even worse because I feel like I look like a bowling ball and my clothes are very hard to fit into. To make matters worse, people are commenting on my weight. Which we all know is a big NO NO. Even my Nana told me ""you should stop eating or you're gonna get EVEN fatter' I've been trying so hard to hold myself together because I literally hate myself and it seems like everyone else does to. I have never felt more ugly and unsatisfied with myself.

So all in all, I know it's going to be hard to lose the weight I gained due to psych meds, WHILE on psych meds. But I need a healthy way to lose the weight without purging. First step is to stop binging so I don't have to purge. 

Therfore, does anyone have any tips on how to feel full and satisfied with the amount and type of food I'm eating???          I don't want to binge and purge, but I don't want to put myself back into the cycle of not eating at all.

Any help is greatly appreciated! ðŸ¤ðŸ¤ðŸ¤",bipolar_disorder

For the record, I'm not against it, I think they're beautiful, I just don't want one for myself (unless I'm manic)!

But seeing everybody's tattoos on here lately I've been starting to think about maybe going for it. I've designed something different from anybody else's, but it does represent my mental illness vs being purely an artistic thing, and it would be teensy tiny and maybe in a place that would usually be covered up by clothing. It's the first time I've thought about getting a tattoo that meant something other than 'this is cool and pretty to look at.'

On the other hand, I did spend like $500 in one day a couple days ago (some was for work though), messaged literally all my friends to ask if they wanted to hang out, decided to go to Panama (in November, not hopping on a plane right this minute), have been sleeping slightly less, and I've been pretty excited lately, so I'm kind of worried I might be ramping up. 

So my question is: does anybody have any tattoo advice for when you're not sure about it? I definitely plan to wait it out if possible and see if I still want it when I'm positive I'm not Up, but I'm nervous I'll just do it impulsively if I don't have some kind of plan in place for this decision-making process (and I live within walking distance of a tattoo parlor so it's a real possibility).

I think they notice the little shit but then when I boil over I shock everyone and everyone tells me how they didnâ€™t think I was doing that bad, even my therapist and psychiatrist. The only one who really sees it is my partner, whoâ€™s been so supportive and Iâ€™m incredibly lucky to have him.

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore because I feel like Iâ€™ve lost my whole life now that Iâ€™m not working full time. My partner and I are both so worried about me, but now weâ€™re really worried about money. Luckily Iâ€™m able to work part time still but Iâ€™m just so embarrassed that I feel like I let the company down.

Anyone else having to come to terms with their limits? I feel like Iâ€™ve been pushing myself too far and I need to accept that a 9-5 isnâ€™t for me. How do you cope with feeling like a failure?",bipolar_disorder
"Normally my past lows and suicide attempts have been extremely impulsive because of how painful everything was.
This time it's different. I'm done. I'm over it. I'm happy with what I've done so far in my life and I can live with that. There's nothing left for me to give and I just want peace now.
Why is it though that I have to stick around for everyone else? Why don't I get to make that choice?
No one else knows what it's like to constantly change meds, new side effects, extended periods of time off work, financial instability, feeling like your brain is slowly melting away, all the while trying to simply stay alive.

"Well this is what my days been like. My husband finally got to call me from prison this morning after first being put in there a week and a half ago.

I asked him how his meds were going because his also bipolar and he straight up said I havenâ€™t had any seroquel because they donâ€™t allow it here theyâ€™ve just been giving me my antidepressant 3 times a day. 

Iâ€™m thinking what the actual fuck? He said he hasnâ€™t slept the whole week and sounded rapid and sketchy. So then his sister gets me on the phone after I spoke to him and I said he hasnâ€™t been taken meds she then asked yeah well apart from sounding sketchy is he okay? And I said I guess he said he was bored?
Then she said thatâ€™s good! 
So that kind of put me off 

Then the more I thought about it through out the day the more it was fucking with my head. Anyway I told his mum then she really freaked me out so I called thhe prison. And they basically said we canâ€™t have a mental health professional approach him he needs to approach them for help. And Iâ€™m saying if heâ€™s hypermanic heâ€™s probably on cloud 9 and wonâ€™t ask for help. Then they said thereâ€™s people watching him so theyâ€™ll jump in if they need to. Like what?

So then I called mine and his psychologist whoâ€™s seen a couple of times and pretty well start blurting out whatâ€™s going on with the his meds and she straight up says hold up, you guys arenâ€™t living together anymore? Whatâ€™s going on? Then I asked her if sheâ€™d spoken to my husbands solicitor and she said no. Where as his sister told me said psychologist was pissed off because weâ€™d been drinking when we got arrested. 

So yep, here the fuck I am second day quitting smoking, 4th day quitting smoking thinking what the absolute fuck.

The advice Iâ€™ve been given is when I speak to him convince him to ask to see a psychologist. So hopefully he doesnâ€™t smash someoneâ€™s head in over night or lose his absolute shit and end up in a mental unit tripping the fuck out.",bipolar_disorder

At this stage the toddler is constantly running around the apartment, very loud, has meltdowns multiple times a day, and he doesnâ€™t have a grasp of personal space yet. 

All of these things are totally fine for them, but I am finding my anxiety/stress getting triggered quite heavily whenever he is with us.

Would it be ok to tell my partner that sometimes when his son it here I just need to take some extra quiet time to myself? I think itâ€™s just the phase that my bipolar is in right now, but maybe if I were able to take some breaks and have some quiet time on the evenings he is here then I can feel more peaceful about it?

"I showed symptoms of bipolar since 4th grade and my normal growing up were having spurts of random high energy, not being able to sleep, excessively talking, grandiose thoughts, and also suffering from mild depression at times. My mood symptoms weren't severe as a kid but they definitely rose eyebrows from my teachers and other people.

Now that I'm on medication, I don't get these mood swings anymore but I can't help but feel like the meds are making me depressed... okay, maybe depressed is not the right term but more disconnected in a sense. I don't feel like I can connect with people the same way. To be honest, I think I relied a lot on my hypomanic energy as a kid to make friends. But now that I don't have that energy anymore I don't have that much of a drive to connect with people. 

The thing that fucks with me is social media. I see people chatting with each other or posting pictures of their friends and I wonder why am I not like that. Maybe I'm not normal? I don't have much friends at all. I wish I had more but at the same time that means I'll have more responsibilities and more friends = more drama. But I always feel a sense of loneliness and I don't know why... but I also don't have the desire to make friends so idk what I even want.

I'm not sure where this loneliness is coming from. Maybe it's from an excessive use of social media and not really connecting with others in the real world. Also, I was in my house for the large majority of time since covid, and my community college was online for 2 years. I also struggle with social anxiety so maybe that and being home stuck has been exacerbating my loneliness. 

Anyways, I kind of accepted that being on medication doesn't mean every aspect of my life will be easier. It should be overall easier but I need to get used to things that was easy for me during my times of instability. One of them being creative and making friends.

I'm a rather good software developer, but between managing my bipolar over the last 2 hears and taking my daughter full time by myself, everything is very difficult.

She's not potty trained because of it.  She's had trama due to fights her mom and I had when she was little.  She has extreme anger issues and is horribly defiant to authority.  She's behind in school as well.  Basically, she ""appears"" to do well if you're always giving her attention and things to do.  You never stop her unless she's ready.  You always cook the food she wants, etc.

"Hi everyone,

So after a period of I guess 1-2 months feeling down I suddenly felt hyper last month. I noticed it especially the other day at work where, despite working nights (I'm a shift worker) and doing 45 minutes overtime, I found myself more active, chatty towards everyone and I said whatever went through my mind.

Fast forward to earlier where I finally slept more than 8 hours in a row. I woke up, and still am, pretty down. I ordered food as I didn't feel like cooking, watched TV and that's it. I have a few urgent things to do but I can't get myself to do them as I really lack the mental energy and feel down without any real reason: the only thing that happened was sleeping.

Did this occur to any of you? I have trouble even thinking it makes sense: the days with no sleep or where I sleep a few hours I manage to be a lot happier than this.

"Last year my diagnosis was switched from major depression/anxiety to bipolar 2, and my meds went from Effexor and epilim to just effexor, and then replacing that with Lamotrigine. Coming off the last of the Effexor was hell on wheels, and Iâ€™ve had a couple of periods where something mild has sent my anger through the roof - Iâ€™ve been blaming it on Effexor withdrawal, but I suppose it could be the lamotrigine?

My psychiatrist has now got me trialling lithium on top of the lamotrigine. Itâ€™s been almost a week, and Iâ€™m about to go for my first blood tests, so Iâ€™m not sure what my levels are. 
Having said that, this last week has been something of a nightmare. The day of my appointment I was having a really down day, but still made it through most of a day at work, made it to my appointment, managed a lot of other things I generally struggle with, so I knew I just had to get through it. I took the first lithium dose that night and since then it has been downhill, but not depressed. Iâ€™ve never really been manic manic, and even my hypomania episodes are pretty scattered, so this is really unusual. 
Two days after the first dose I was feeling what Iâ€™m guessing was a mixed state, and more â€œI want to end thisâ€ than I have in years, and worse than I remember feeling while totally unmedicated.
I got four hours sleep last night, and feel uncomfortably restless, physically irritable, like Iâ€™m full of bees, almost a panic attack state. The only other time Iâ€™ve been like this was when I spent 3 weeks on prednisone for a bad infection. I do not like this at all. 
My question is, is this part of the process? Is it normal for things to feel worse on lithium initially and then improve? Is it a coincidence Iâ€™m unfairly blaming on the lithium? Is it an indication I need to contact the dr again and maybe lithium isnâ€™t for me?
Iâ€™m not trusting my own judgements around this at the moment, I could do with outside opinions or experiences.",bipolar_disorder
"When I first started high school I was diagnosed as adhd because I couldnâ€™t â€œfocusâ€. This isnâ€™t entirely true and I donâ€™t know why my parents snd doctors were so determined to diagnose me with it. In reality I was exhausted, I skipped school multiple times because I was just so tired. I would sleep through class even if I did go. I was depressed and thatâ€™s why I couldnâ€™t focus. I resisted the stimulants until my senior year of high school and the first time I took them it blew my mind. I remember doing multitudes of homework in a day, not sleeping for more than three hours for like a month, I was absolutely off the walls. My mind was extremely sharp, my grades skyrocketed. To everyone on the outside this seemed like it was working. Now being diagnosed bipolar two years later I question if I was ever even adhd in the first place. Speaking to people who are adhd about their stimulant experience they describe it as their mind being clear for the first time ever. It was the complete opposite for me. Everything was x100 for about a month then they lost effect and I was right back where I started but worse. I would have these periods where I would think â€œwow the meds are working againâ€ then crash a month later. I chased this â€œhighâ€ my entire last year of high school. This cycle went on until I had an awful depressive episode my first year of college followed by a full blown manic episode then a diagnosis with bipolar. I just wonder if I was ever adhd. If I wasnâ€™t then thereâ€™s no doubt that taking stimulants for two years probably made things a lot worse for me. What I experienced sounds more like rapid cycling bipolar episodes due to amphetamines than me being adhd and â€œfixedâ€ by the medication. I just wish my parents and doctor wouldâ€™ve at least considered I was depressed all those years back. Iâ€™m fully convinced â€œadhd inattentiveâ€ is just another manifestation of depression and maybe even a precursor to being bipolar. Who knows.

Now I did it. I cleaned my room. I've kept it clean. Which means I'm in a better place mentally, but getting my room clean was such an endorphins rush. Hell, days where I just made progress was an endorphins rush. Now I'm sitting here and I need to feel accomplished and... Nothing.

"It's the roller-coaster ride that I never asked to be on.

The constant ups and constant downs,

yeah... it's nauseating.



At first, it was fun.

Only because I didn't realize I was on one. 



I've been on this horrible ride for years now.

Just up, down, up, down..

Never ending.



Bipolar automatically throws you on this emotional ride

tormenting you, teasing you.

Making you feel the rush from being up so high

but then making you feel on the verge of death from falling so far down.



There is no in-between.

There will never be an in-between. 



And if there is, it's pretty rare or simply put...

Short lived.



You crash and burn so fast that you never have the time to even prepare for the fall.

What really sucks is that the highs the coaster puts you on is so short lived.



It's not fair.



Another thing that sucks is that you're crashing and burning longer

never knowing when that devilish ride will bring you back up.



Bipolar will forever keep you on this ride from Hell until that biological clock runs out.

So you should probably get used to it. 



Harsh, I know...

But that's just our reality.

Our Bipolar reality.



While you're on this high from the ride,

you feel unstoppable. 

You feel confident, more than usual that is.

You're in a heightened mood.



Whether that mood is filled with being happy 

OR

that mood causes you to be overly and easily irritated.



Sadly, that's the mood I  experience.

Extreme irritability.

But mix it with a little bit of confidence, some extreme energy

and BAM! 

You tell yourself that you never want to get off this ride.



Until it crashes into the darkness of God only knows what.



Then you start saying to yourself, 

""What the Hell?""

""I was feeling so great these last few days or week(s), why is this happening to me?!""



""Oh wait...""



Yeah, I'm sure you've had these exact thoughts, if not similar.



Not to mention that once you leave that high, which we call (Hypo)mania,

you start to drown in an intense amount of guilt.

Not even realizing that during that time of being in the highs of the ride,

that you've actually hurt some people while in your own ""world"".



You start wondering what the hell you did during this time.

""Why is everyone mad at me?""

""Why can't I always remember?""



Now you spend the next few days, weeks or even months

going through the mess you've made,

trying to pick up the pieces you lost along the way and try to repair relationships.



Oh how lovely... 

Not.



It is a never ending cycle.

A pretty vicious one might I add.



Which is why Bipolar has one of the most horrible rides a person could ever be on.



And what's funny is...



We didn't ask to be on this ride,

but here we are...",bipolar_disorder

I'm currently not smoking weed and was wondering if some full spectrum CBD or CBG might be helpful in bringing me down from acute mania. I'm on lithium and risperidone, and both have pretty uncomfortable side effects. Thinking I could speed the process up. 

I know your psychiatrist will tell you not to use any cannabis. They can't legally reccomend it for fear of lawsuits and malpractice.

"This is really annoying. I find that this is my go-to coping mechanism when I am stressed. It's also one of my biggest symptoms when my bipolar is activating - ie manic symptoms or even euthymic psychotic symptoms / mixed state episodes. It's also very easily triggered by some less sedating anti psychotics like Abilify, or any medication that can induce akathisia.

At one stage I had this so bad I had the whole ""taking off clothes and putting them back on"" symptom like an old school psych patient. I was in a mixed state psychosis from benzo withdrawal but at the time I was convinced it was actually an ABI.

At the moment I'm a bit stressed about a new job coming up. My finances aren't great because my disability has been cut off as a result of intending to work full time, and I have to wait a few weeks for my first pay cheque, so I'm pacing again. New job anxiety is quite normal, as is imposter syndrome that comes with it. I know it will pass largely after I'm settled in.

So far the only things that really help with these symptoms are sedating antipsychotics like Zyprexa which I can't take with my new job cos of oversleeping. Also exercise, which I could be doing more of. Meditation too would be useful.

It would be good to get some tips and support from some fellow bipolar bears with this. It's quite annoying and is a trigger to return to substance use that I've been doing really well with for some time.

I still feel confused, remembering bits and pieces. Unable to understand some of it. Feeling very cringe. Feel like it wouldn't take much to drop right back into it.

"I've struggled with mental health since early childhood; sustained periods of immense boredom, irritability/anger mood swings, anxiety related sleep issues. 

I was diagnosed with depression and offered a prescription by psychiatrists (SSRI) a few times since age 12 which I never tried. I always felt like it was depression with a physiological/chemical cause that I couldn't control with any method of therapy. During depressive periods I always feel what I best describe as hollow tension in my head and feeling generally bad even when meditating. It seeps into my thought process no matter what I think about. I can still socialize normally, I just feel fake and don't genuinely connect.

People always told me I was smart, good looking, funny. This never inflated my ego or really rang  true to me, even if I understood what they were talking about or that they were saying those things genuinely. There were a few times in my life where I felt like everything was on track, I felt like I was socializing normally, etc. but I never really ""felt like the life of the party"" or had any passion controlling or motivating me. I don't think I ever experienced mania or hypomania. From my perspective my best periods would be described as low-average mood and energy compared to general population, and family/friends that I've asked agree with that.

I managed to put together a pretty good life for myself before COVID started. COVID made my job very stressful and I suffered my first panic attack as a result in April or May of 2020. Since then I experienced increased anxiety that mostly presented as problematic when I tried to sleep. Otherwise I think I was doing okay. I got my life back on track and was feeling normal, though the anxiety was still present and not tied to any specific thoughts as far as I could tell. I achieved a work milestone and started a serious relationship around the same time in the first half of 2021 and all of a sudden felt the start of a severe depressive episode, which eventually led to my relationship ending and losing my job in August 2021.

I started an SSRI for the first time in my life at age 26 and within about a week I had a lot of side effects, felt very strange, and started compulsively smoking cannabis (which I wasn't using at the time) to try to counteract what I was feeling. Was completely unlike the person I've been for the entirety of my life. Within 2 weeks I experienced my second and third panic attacks in my life, on back to back days, both resulting in my emergency services physician directing me to the ER to get a benzodiazepine. My physician and psychiatrist both provided me with benzodiazepines (on separate dates) and from there my journey is kind of difficult to remember. However I added an atypical antidepressant (bupropion) to the other 2. It seemed to help with mood and motivation, though I still felt depressed and not like myself. My psychiatrist agreed to me tapering off the SSRI and suggested adding another atypical antidepressant (Mirtazapine) at the same time. Within a week or two I had a severe acute manic episode which was short lived because I was hospitalized and medicated for it. They took me off all of my medication except the benzos.

They switched me to Olanzepine and Lithium. The Olanzepine made me tired, but if I wasn't sleepy it made me feel delirious until I slept it off. My physician did a blood test for Lithium content and found that I was sub-therapeutic. Repeated the test and found out my liver enzymes were VERY high from the Olanzepine and my lithium levels were at a therapeutic level. I was feeling depressed throughout but functional and still able to socialize though I wasn't able to look for another job, which I still haven't been able to do yet. I was taken off the Olanzepine and told to compensate with more benzodiazepines. I had increasing bad feelings which I tried to compensate with increasing benzodiazipine dosage. I had an anxiety attack where I didn't know what to do to feel safe and it led to  an episode of uncontrolled rage where I damaged my own property and was re-admitted to hospital for depressive-mania. I was taken off the Lithium and given high dose Quetiapine which caused me to sleep all day for 2 days. Once I couldn't sleep it off it made me feel delirious and I requested to stop taking it. Drug withdrawal was absolutely brutal in many ways, and I felt like I went crazy. For the next week or two I felt very balanced (which everyone around me agreed with) and like a beacon of mental stability. However, I would get overwhelmed very easily, was extremely sensitive to noises (could hear static from electric wires), and needed to process my anxiety in silence where it like I was going to drive myself into a state of permanent psychosis. A few weeks later and I feel like my old self again except i'm getting lots of headaches. I'm depressed, a bit anti-social even though I'm lonely, unmotivated to do anything, barely feel like eating though I'll bing eat junk food. I don't feel like I have any risk of going manic again. My psychiatrist wants me on Lamotrigine but I just want a little break from the meds and really don't like the sound of that one or feel hopeful about it. I still want to take a lower dose of antidepressants and have read a couple papers supporting the use of antidepressants in bipolar. I know i'm not the best judge of my own treatment, I just don't want to feel like life is pointless and hard while also feeling hopeless for anything more than brief intermissions of feeling OK.

So my questions are: 
Does a single acute manic episode on a variety of medications (amongst rec. drug use and other factors) guarantee a bipolar 1 diagnosis is correct? Should I give up on the possibility of retrying the antidepressants that made me feel good because of this manic episode?

Is an episode of rage behavior while on Lithium and high dose benzodiazipines indicative of bipolar 1?

"I got a new doc via county services about six months ago. I've seen her three times, each worse than the one before it.

My lithium go to high so it was reduced. Aside from bipolar I also have generalized anxiety disorder. She refuses to treat the latter as ""your meds should take care of that. Go to therapy."". When I told her I was in therapy she had no response.

She got upset when discussing propanol. If I take it scheduled I have no way to treat panic attacks. I took it religiously for years and it was used as a back up if I had breakthrough symptoms such as a panic attack.

I've been diagnosed twenty years. As said I've seen her three times and she thinks she understands more than I do about my emotional state.

To further this I have to get doctor approval to sign my DPS forms so I can drive legally. She will not sign it for any reason. When asked it's clear she doesn't want to be liable, but it only causes more issues for me.

My last appointment was 4 minutes long. I timed it. After a year using county services I just got a case worker. I told the case worker to what was up and she offered a new doc. Part of my issue is my current doc (she's really a psych nurse) has a heavy accent and I barely understand her. I was told any other clinician would have the same issue.

I had a similar issue a couple years back. I changed docs and it was night and day.

As I write this I understand the path. I have to get a doc interested in me, and is willing to talk. How could I possibly relay the last two months in four minutes? Despite me providing 5 years of notes from other docs she has never read mine. Why? She doesn't have it. Despite sending it, having the last doc send it, and it being dropped off personally they don't have it.

I'm being treated as if this was my first psych doc. Not even close. This means my thoughts and concerns aren't founded in reality, but instead delusions. That's fucked.

She also drug tested me without telling me. I use CBD to help with a number of things. Drug use didn't come up despite knowing it will be there because she is focused on keeping interaction to a minimum.

I needed to vent. Anyone else despise their clinician? Having issues?

My current cycle is one major episode every couple of years which is coming up shortly. I'm self aware, know when I need help, but the idea of managing psychosis outpatient won't work so if anything happens the dance of getting hospitalized starts and will leave my life in ruin.

I have the urge to go somewhere with just him and I for our five year anniversary in October.  It sounds like he doesnâ€™t want to.  He always brings up money.  I donâ€™t have access to our bank account anymore.  Meaning the online banking.  The password changed and I canâ€™t reset it. So I am not sure how much we have in our account. 

I have had the urge to travel or try something new and it never happens.   Our sex life sucks.  In my depressive stage and after having my babies I had a low libido.  But as of lately I am interested in sex again .  Heâ€™s turned me down a few times.

Before I was on medication I spent money on unnecessary items when shopping.  This stuck out to my psychiatrist as well as the depressive mood.

"Iâ€™ve been manic for 3 weeks. In the meantime I moved in with a random girl who was looking for a flatmate. Sheâ€™s partying 3-4 times a week, she always has a random guy over and sheâ€™s really cheerful. Because of me being manic we instantly hit it off: we joked about our flat turning into a sex dungeon, we drank a lot and bonded over our hookup stories. But the truth is, Iâ€™m never like this. I barely drink, I am quite shy and looooove being at home and doing nothing. I hate parties, I prefer reading alone and I donâ€™t like having sex with random people. Now I am scared that when mania passes, she will see the real me she will be disappointed.

I also met a guy who is really nice, we worked great together and I am having feelings for him. But heâ€™s also a really happy, warm person, he is constantly doing something, loves adventures. Yesterday I felt my mania beginning to calm down. I was laying in bed next to him and got lost in thought: for the first time in weeks I stopped talking and got real quiet, which is actually my usual state. He instantly noticed the change and started asking me if Iâ€™m ok and what am I thinking about and he seemed worried, when in reality, I was finally myself again.

"(Trigger warning: mention of SH thoughts) 
(Sorry for formatting Iâ€™m on mobile).                     
My dad developed bipolar around 22-24 years old I believe, not exactly sure the exact age, but it was his early 20s. My sister and I, while having many mental issues were relieved that bipolar wasnâ€™t one that we inherited, but I am 18 now and things are different. I was diagnosed with MDD a few years ago and I take medication for it, still trying to find out what works but overall doing okay on that front. I recently got a new therapist as my depression has spiraled and itâ€™s worse than it ever has been and itâ€™s much different this time too.                   
There are some things that stand out as new, like explosive anger. Iâ€™ve never gotten so angry in my life, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m going to melt or explode because I canâ€™t contain it. I throw things and breakdown and no matter what I do to try and calm myself I just canâ€™t, it doesnâ€™t go away until it wants to. The things that I get angry over are trivial and stupid, but no matter how many times I tell myself I shouldnâ€™t be this mad over it I canâ€™t get rid of the rage. I get so mad that I start laughing and then crying and itâ€™s a mess. This depression also just feels different, itâ€™s so heavy and destroys my life. I canâ€™t do anything I canâ€™t think straight I have SH urges for the first time in a very long time and something about this sadness is different. Iâ€™m not sure how to explain it, but I know itâ€™s different.                                                
Well as I explained these things to my therapist and other things in my life she told me that she thinks I could possibly be developing bipolar like my dad. The thought terrifies me because I canâ€™t handle anymore problems, and his bipolar destroyed our family. I donâ€™t want this, but my therapist said that if itâ€™s genetic and I have the gene then I canâ€™t stop it, only find ways to manage it. I told my therapist that I havenâ€™t had any mania symptoms, so Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s what it is, but she said that mania presents itself in different ways and if o have it Iâ€™m probably just barely starting to develop it. The only â€œmania symptomsâ€ I have had are extreme anger and a random extreme spike in libido, but those arenâ€™t necessarily mania I thought.                              
There are many parallels between my dads depression and mine, and he and I actually respond positively to two medications, the same two (Lexapro and Wellbutrin), but Iâ€™m still trying out different meds so that could change.

"So, disclaimer. I am not in any immediate danger. I am medicated and in an okay place. I just wanted to know if anyone else did this.

About 10 years ago (right before I met my wife) I pre wrote some going away notes. Basically last wishes stuff and some things to get off my chest that I couldn't say out loud. They were addressed to family members and my now ex girlfriend. Written in a mixed episode, during psychosis, I sewed them into the liner of a leather jacket I never wear. 

Cue the day before yesterday. My daughter wants the old leather jacket. Cool, put patches on it. Punk Rock af. Take it. My wife goes and grabs it and feels the packet in the liner. She fortunately took them out and away, out of my daughters sight. But.... they were never sealed and she was confused as to why I had a letter to my ex. 

She read them. All of them. Stuff that I've never told anyone about my childhood, my drug use back then. All kinds of manic rants on page after page of legal pad paper, front and back. To people I no longer speak to (my family is incredibly toxic).

 My wife, has seen me in brief spurts of non medication. Never where I was then, with no meds and no insurance. Self medicating was all I had. She's been really quiet the last couple of days. Still communicating, but I can tell she's worried and stressed. I want to hug her and tell her I'm not that person anymore. But I know it's still in there. Just controlled.

We haven't really talked about it other than her saying I should've thrown them away, and asking me when I wrote them.

I don't know what to do. Has anyone else had something from a bad episode crop up like this? What do I say to her? Because there's no guarantee it couldn't happen again. I'm not going to lie to her. I don't think I'll let it get that bad again, but who knows? What if it's out of my control? I just don't know what to do besides give her space.",bipolar_disorder

While my episodes are less frequent than they used to be, they are more intense. FWIW, I was diagnosed with BP1 at 19, I am now 35, with multiple hospitalizations. I know that my current Hx of trauma and homelessness are exacerbating everything, but it must hit me today that the huge increase in intensity of symptoms came about mostly since I was pregnant in 2019. I went off my meds as soon as I found out I was pregnant because I didn't trust they could be safe enough for my son, and the effects on me were devastating. For the record, I have decided that for any future pregnancies, it would be healthier for me and my baby to stay on a couple of my meds. But as a result of going off my mess while pregnant, raging hormones, and ongoing trauma, I had about 3 psychiatric hospitalizations during my pregnancy. And since giving birth, I was fairly stable for a while, but the episodes I have had since then have been completely out of control, more severe, and unpredictable than ever before.

Itâ€™s taken a LONG time to get here. From misdiagnoses to his general reluctance to following through with appointments, Iâ€™m exhausted, and I can only imagine what that means for him. 

Heâ€™s been on 20mg Lexapro for maybe a year now (for maybe-sort-of letâ€™s-see-if-this-works depression/anxiety) with hardly any change. My limited understanding is that SSRIs do very little to help people diagnosed bipolar and can sometimes make the oscillation between highs and lows worse. 

Heâ€™ll be tapering off that and also starting Trileptal (unsure of the dosage, but I think itâ€™s 2x a day) and a small dose of Seroquel to help with sleep. I imagine heâ€™s gonna feel like shit for awhile; he was super nauseous when starting the Lexapro.

"I am 34. Diagnosed at 15. Iâ€™ve had several jobs every one of which made me worse and I have evidence of that. I plan to have all my medical records, prescription records to prove I stayed on meds for years and had follow ups regularly, personnel records from all my jobs showing the issues I had (including retail, food service, call center, WFH health insurance customer service, medical records clerk, and medical administrative assistant). I also went to college and didnâ€™t finish due to my issues but donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s worth submitting any records because I did work full time at one point and ace my classes only dropping the math related ones because I have a learning disability related to math that was not yet diagnosed and those classes caused me to break down. This was at a community college. I also have two bankruptcies owed to excessive spending in mania which was exacerbated at work. I have bipolar 1, borderline personality disorder, â€œsevereâ€ ADHD, and the learning disorder with math which the psychiatrist said is related to ADHD. Oh. And my IQ is apparently 68 which is apparently just under what the SSA deems the minimum IQ to not be, please forgive this terminology because I believe it is theirs, â€œmildly retardedâ€. Feel free to correct that. I really mean no offense and I do NOT use that word. I also plan to submit letters from two family members and a friend who both worked with me for several years and has maintained a personal friendship with me as well as making sure I have support from all my doctors. My mom is helping me get all this together because, letâ€™s face it, Iâ€™m not totally capable of that which is why Iâ€™m applying to begin with. Family has been encouraging me to apply for years but it just felt like giving up to me and I am having a hard time dealing with that. But itâ€™s time. I know it will likely still get denied and be a fight but I have to face this. I need it. 

When we have everything together, I am going with my mom down to the office to apply with all this info in hand. 

So anyway, my questions. 

Is there any sample letters or anything I can give to the family and friends writing the letters to know the kind of info that will be relevant? Not in any way telling them what to say.

"Went through a brief hypmanic episode about a month ago and ended up scaring my partner. They're a bit new to me, at least realizing them for what they are. This one only lasted a couple of days.

I was in a really amazing, euphoric mood with a ton of plans for these grand acts I would do for my partner and myself. My partner described me as childlike and unable to understand reality. I started painting painting painting, planning trips around the world, applying to jobs I am completely unqualified for, spending more money than I usually do on silly fun objects, texting friends and people I hadn't spoken to in months to years, etc. My partner was trying to calm me down, get me to go to bed because it was nearing 1 AM and they were exhausted. 

I came up with the grand idea to bike downtown and paint them a mural of something they love. While they thanked me for the gesture, they said that was incredibly dangerous and there's no way I'd be going. And they're 100% right, in my right mind I'd never do that at 1 in the morning, bike to the city which is at least an hour or two bike away. 

Well, I started to get my helmet on and the tires pumped and was ready to head out. My partner was so extremely stressed that they burst out screaming at me, in my face, and ran and slammed the bedroom door shut. They broke down crying on our bed. 

At the time, I remember struggling to wrap my head around this. Were they mad because I was going without them? Did they want to come too? Did I not pump the tires enough? Maybe I should use a different helmet! All very irrational things that at the time seemed completely rational. I even went in to apologize. They were eventually able to talk me out of the bike ride (I still went for a long walk headed towards downtown, then got distracted with something else and realized I needed supplies at home). 

I felt my mood lowering though over the course of the rest of the night (morning?). Their yelling really scared me, for them. I don't want to be stressing them out this much. I was recently diagnosed bipolar, but haven't experienced something like this with another person around me for this long of a time. I've been trying to see a therapist and psychiatrist (my insurance changed and I've been stuck on waitlists), but I don't know what to do in the meantime. And I can't get over how upset and angry they were in that moment. It keeps playing on repeat in my head, especially now that I'm fully aware why they were so rightfully angry. 

We've talked. I've told them it's okay if they want to leave/break-up, particularly when I've been depressed. I am so heartbroken with myself for causing this stress on them. I really want our relationship to work, but it's like they're in a relationship with my mental illness, not me. I can't wait to see these new professionals, dammit.

I have not found a decent medication for me, but I am functional enough to work or go to school now. I wasnâ€™t for the last couple years and just started getting better even though Iâ€™m not on meds. Of course Iâ€™m still no where near the norm. I have 3 bad days then 3 good or okay days. I also, have to go back to school and before my mental break down and diagnosis I was almost finished I only have 4 classes left. The thing is I was just functional enough back then and barely making it through a casual job and classes. I really miss those days though I was happy even though chemically I wasnâ€™t because I was productive and just took a sleep aid. Iâ€™m just scared of crashing and burning jumping into all this and still not being 100%. I am now 24, and hoping to get back to my 20 year old productiveness level. Any advice would be much appreciated if someone has been in this kinda situation.",bipolar_disorder
"Hi guys. I'm on Lithium and Desvenlafaxine so I can't drink alcohol and caffeine. For health reasons I also quit smoking and cut out social media. Long story short, my life was already pretty slow before going on medicatiom: I focused solely on not going too cuckoo bananas with bipolar on a daily basis, worked, dealt with family issues and that was it. I haven't had hobbies or anything since my childhood because I simply don't have energy for them.
But now that my life is calmer and I don't have too many mental health/family crisis, my days go by in unenjoyable stillness. I work from home as a secretary for less than a minimum wage so that's self-explanatory, I'm on break from college and the extra reading isn't all that exciting... so I just watch TV and clean all day but this routine is eating me up from the inside. I feel lazy and awful and just overall hopeless as to where I'm going with my life. I feel like an old lady. I can't even go out with people and have fun.
I do have dreams but I don't have goals so I don't know what steps to take. But then again, as soon as I try to sit down and study anything I immediately get uninterested and frustrated and give up.",bipolar_disorder
"Before being diagnosed with bipolar 2, I would have emotional swings and think nothing really of it. Until they were really bad. Now that I look at my actions and emotions through the lens of having bipolar, I feel like every time I show major emotion itâ€™s just me â€œbeing bipolarâ€.

For example, the other day I got very upset (both angry and sad/betrayed) by a friendâ€™s comment. He continued to talk about it even after he could tell I was getting upset. I yelled at him, and tried to tell him to stop talking about the subject. He continued for a bit until he finally dropped it. After that, I had to ask his girlfriend who was there if I was just out of line. She said I wasnâ€™t, but the whole interaction still caused me to spiral for the next few days. 

I feel like Iâ€™ve developed a fear of acting on any intense emotion because Iâ€™ll just be the person that either flies off the handle or canâ€™t just toughen up and stop being sad. Does anyone else feel this way? And do you chalk it up to anxiety or do you think itâ€™s a justified thing to think or worry about?",bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™ve been in a mixed state now for a month or so. I thought I was depressed but actually had some mania symptoms alongside it all. Iâ€™m averaging 3 hours sleep a night and even that is broken for the past 4 weeks. I have just laid in bed for 2.5 hours listening to sleep meditations and even had a sleeping pill but I just canâ€™t switch off. I donâ€™t know whether I should call someone from my mental health team, I was in hospital in Feb this year and so scared to go back there. Usually, prescription sleeping pills will make me sleep but this time they arenâ€™t. Iâ€™m so frustrated because Iâ€™m doing all the right things to sleep and yet my brain wonâ€™t shut off. Does anyone have any tips for this please? Also I donâ€™t know whether to call the team or not because I donâ€™t know what else really they can do? Thanks for listening, Iâ€™m just feeling really lonely and canâ€™t speak to people around me about this as I donâ€™t want to be a burden.",bipolar_disorder
"hi!

i was wondering if any of yall - like me - are both bipolar &amp; adhd, and if you could provide any insight on your experience with ADHD meds.

im excited cuz im finally getting in to see someone for ADHD meds, but my previous psychs have said that it can be hard to find one that works without triggering mania or depression.

i know that everyones different, and that i can work thru these q's w my psych in a month, but in the meantime \~ 

have any of you found a adhd med + bipolar med balance that works for you? if so, how long did it take for you to find a reliable med? if not, what was your experience? would you recommend the med route? any other insights &amp; info is appreciated! i also love resources :)",bipolar_disorder
"I am f29, just got my bp2 diagnosis. Itâ€™s been really hard for me to wrap my head around, I also just found out this week that one of my best friends growing up suddenly passed away. I have a lot of things to work out with my new diagnosis and process this loss. I have been on only antidepressants for the last decade not knowing I was bipolar. 

My doctor is having me try out new medications for my bipolar. So far abilify is a no, it makes me manic. Iâ€™m having a really hard time with my emotions. 

Iâ€™m thinking of taking a leave of absence from work, but the job I have because itâ€™s part time doesnâ€™t qualify me for any paid leave. Me and my husband are struggling already financially. We really canâ€™t afford me not to work. We live with my parents because our rent went up too high. Thereâ€™s a lot going on in my life thatâ€™s causing me anxiety depression and making my illness worse. 

I want to take time off to focus on my mental health, and to try to find the right medication. But I donâ€™t know how long that will take. Has anyone been in this kind of situation before? Iâ€™m at a loss of what to do.",bipolar_disorder

"Not looking for a diagnosis or anything, just want to see if anyone has gone through something similar. Basically about a month and a half ago I was diagnosed as type 2 bipolar or maybe cyclothymia and was put on Gabapentin as an off label mood stabilizer, a month went by and the meds didnâ€™t work for me at all and not to get too into it but my psychiatrist I just felt was being generally very mean to me for no reason and I was impatient with continuing Gabapentin, definitely a fault on my part as I should have just stuck with her and keep upping the dose but I made the mistake and am in the process of finding a new psychiatrist. I then saw a psychiatrist through my university who is supposed to only be short term until I find a permanent one outside of the university but basically at that appointment she didnâ€™t say I was or was not bipolar but that meds can have horrible side effects and she wasnâ€™t going to prescribe me anything. She definitely was sort of dropping hints that all of my problems sound like things I should just work through in therapy and I feel like my therapist is also thinking that I might not actually be bipolar (weâ€™ve only had like 3 sessions or so so far) Iâ€™ve contacted another psychiatrist but havenâ€™t met with them yet. I guess Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone has been misdiagnosed as bipolar but then later found out that they donâ€™t have any mental illness diagnosis at all? If Iâ€™m being honest maybe I was just happy for a diagnosis to explain why I am the way I am or maybe just wanted something quick like medicine to help fix my problems. I know it probably sounds dumb iâ€™m just so tired of intake appointments and not understanding how I feel or why I feel the way that I do. Thx for reading me vent",bipolar_disorder

I've been on lithium for a couple months now. Really ever since I got out of the psych ward I've been taking it consistently. But fuck the side effects are starting to become overwhelming. My body won't stop tingling and I'm really nauseous. Plus lithium hasn't really helped my depression. To be honest it may have made it worse. I just feel a dark cloud engulf me and the only thing I want to do is sleep. I have no motivation to play video games or read or really do anything other than go to work and barely survive... fuck why do I have to have this disorder.

"I've had undiagnosed, untreated bipolar for most of my life. I'm now on medication for BP2 (a diagnosis I completely agree with) and it's really helping me. My concentration, my motivation is back (this was the huge one for me), my good (but not over-the-top) mood is back, my normal sleep cycle is back. But one thing that hasn't come back from the last really bad depression I was in prior to seeking treatment is (sorry for the TMI) my sex drive.  I'm really bummed about this because I now seem to be unable to sexually function. When I  try to get in the zone with my partner, I just zone out and think about stuff I have to do, or I think about how weird sex is. Sometimes I don't know how to ask for what I want; other times *I* don't even know what I want. I now *want* to want sex, which is different from the depressed me; I just seem to have lost the ability to do it. Everything around sex feels very awkward and alien to me suddenly. 

The other day I had a realization: *I have no idea how to have sex as a healthy person.* Most of my life I've had higher-than-average libido, and I think this is because hypersexuality can be a symptom of hypomania. Most of my memories of sex are associated with that ""glowing and euphoric"" feeling I now realize is a hallmark of hypomania. I used to be really confident in bed and fairly uninhibited. In my untreated days, I had tons of sexual partners, lots of casual sex and group sex. I craved sex a lot of the time and always sought new sexual experiences. I'm ready to calm down a bit with that, and I appreciate that some of this shift might just be getting older and more mature. I no longer need sex to be a huge part of my identity. 

But it sucks that without that ""glowing, godlike"" feeling going along with it that I used to get when I was hypomanic, sex has become boring to me. I really hate feeling like there's this big part of the human experience I'm cut off from. Plus I really love my partner, and I crave the intimacy we shared when we were having sex regularly. 

I guess these are pretty personal questions, but I don't know where else to find the answers, so:

1. Does this check out as a thing that can happen? Has anyone else experienced this?
2. How did you deal with it? Did you just accept it, or did anything help you learn how to enjoy sex as a non-(hypo)manic person? 
3. How do you recalibrate your enjoyment of, and appetite for, sex to what's normal? 
4. How long did it take?",bipolar_disorder

[""The recent advent of interest in pharmacoepigenetics of psychiatric disorders is an alternative research avenue. The epigenetic modification known as DNA methylation (DNAm), one of major epigenetic modifications, is the product of the interaction between genetic variants and environmental influence, and for this reason might be a better predictor of treatment outcomes (Kubota et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2013). Measurable in peripheral blood, alterations of DNAm have been reported to be involved in both the pathology and drug treatment of SCZ, BD, and MDD (Schroeder et al., 2012; Vialou et al., 2013; Jaffe et al., 2016). Drugs may exert their effects by reversing these DNAm deregulations. Moreover, some FDA-approved drugs, like clozapine and sulpiride, have demonstrated the ability to activate brain DNA demethylation (Dong et al., 2008). Therefore, DNAm is a promising molecular approach to study mechanisms and prediction of drug response in psychiatric disorders (Goud Alladi et al., 2018; Lisoway et al., 2018). However, the reproducibility of those results, crucial for their clinical application, has not been thoroughly evaluated.""](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.674273/full)",bipolar_disorder

"Previously saw doctor person and was diagnosed bipolar 2, adhd and social anxiety. Which all makes sense considering well me. Now trying to make progress on getting things under control bc management by force of will is exhausting. So finally made appt and saw a people to get started.

Was told that adhd is only a childhood thing then your brain fixes itself when you go through puberty, that he doesn't think I need any medication just talk therapy and that I don't fit the bipolar 2 but bipolar unspecified. But prescribed risprodol to stabilize my mood while I get started on the therapy and settled in.

Other than the adhd thing he seems to be good at his job. So not sure if I should stick it out for a while and try to see if itll work out well (I suppose it's possible that I'm not adhd just bipolar that looks like it?) or should find another psychiatrist that at least believes adults can have adhd.

"Okay so basically I applied at a company and we're going to call it PB&amp;j and after the interview, I filled all my personal information forms and I never got a call back. My training was supposed to start on Aug. 14th so I was like okay cool I'm supposed to receive an email to tell me how to set up the system on my personal computer, work from home job easy enough.

The 14th comes and goes but on the 14th, I called and emailed multiple different people and left a voicemail. Today the 17th, I decided to call corporate because I'm kind of feeling like I got scammed maybe they wanted my ID and social information and that's why it seemed like it was like a ruse to you know scam me. 

The lady gets on the phone from PB&amp;j corporate office and she tells me that apparently they had called me multiple times on the 14th and prior to that to set up my computer for the new job and they had also sent me an email to set up my computer. The PB&amp;j corporate lady even goes as far as to tell me someone answered MY phone and said ""these hoes"" and hung up. Immediately, I'm concerned because I live alone and I received none of these phone calls or email, she's saying I received. I thank her for her time after she tells me I have to reapply for the position due to me declining the position by not responding to them and I get off the phone.

I had asked her four questions, what number did they call to contact me? what email did they use to contact me? what email address did they email me from? And what number did they call me from? Based on all the information she provided me, my call log showed no calls from pbj or any other unknown number for that matter for the 14th or before. Then for the maybe the 10th time I check my emails/Spam again for the said 'email that I received"" there was none.

So I proceeded to send a long email explaining all of this and the screenshots asking where or how did this happen that I ""declined employment by ceasing communication with the company"" to corporate pbj but all they have to say is just reapply. Hell I might not even get hired now because I sat here and went off on y'all because y'all got some sketchy s*** going on, or someone not doing their job. But I really want an explanation on how this happened cause the facts I have versus the story they telling me ain't adding up and I don't fair well with wrong doing against me for no reason, or things just not adding up when it affects me.

" I know how it sounds just hear me out.

 I've noticed a phenomenon where people with neurodivergencies tend to be more intuitive and sensitive to their realities. Whether it's autism, brain damage or mental illness the person affected is usually in tuned to the world around them. 

  Many times in my life, I have predicted things that would happen. Usually it comes to me in visions or feelings. It's been happening a lot more recently than it did when I was younger. 

  Exactly a year ago, I was driving with my fiance (now husband) and this feeling of pure dread and terror came over me. I imagined a threat to my physical safety, made by another human being. In this flash moment of anxiety I had the thought of someone threatening me with a gun or a knife. Like I would be penetrated by either a bullet or a blade and they would make me bleed. I chalked it up to an irrational random panic attack. Days later my husband was shot in the back by robbers and almost bled to death, but was resuscitated on the operating table. I almost lost him and it was the worst experience of my life.

 The most recent example was from only a month ago. I was drinking with my younger sister and then my imagination was showing me pictures again. This time I saw my sister driving her Jeep on the gravel road to her house, before losing traction and sliding off the road into the ditch sideways and rolling. This scared me and she noticed so she asked me what was wrong. I told her not to drive when the roads are icy and explained what I saw. She laughed it off and said she's sure she'll be fine. A week later she sends me a video she recorded of her and her dog in the Jeep. The SUV was lying on its side, and her dog was standing inside on the passenger window. She'd sent me a video of the aftermath of her crash, luckily she and her dog were unharmed. 

 I know these aren't delusions because my family members remembered my predictions and know now to heed my warnings. Does anyone else have anything similar happen to them? Do you think there's a connection between mental illness and psychic abilities?",bipolar_disorder

"I wanna preface by saying that I understand the need for covid restrictions and guidelines, I care greatly about the needs of the vulnerable in my community and would hate to contribute to the spread of covid. In writing this rant, I am painfully aware that many have lost loved ones or gotten sick themselves and my heart goes out to them. 

That said, the restrictions are forcing me back into habits that scare me. I live in Montreal, QC where gyms are closed, all gatherings are prohibited other than those you live with, and you are not allowed outside your property after 10pm. This past year I have finally started making a conscious and dedicated effort to treat my bipolar after being involuntarily committed following my most recent suicide attempt. I am still early in my recover efforts and only three things have helped me get by. 

From September - December I have followed a rigid, unwavering daily schedule. I did the exact same thing every day for four months and it helped me manage my diet and sleep schedule. Gone were the weeks of skipping meals and sleeping too much or too little. With these new restrictions I am forced to attend my lectures online. In a studio apartment, my space for sleeping and eating has now become my workspace.My schedule is impossible to follow and I am losing track of time. 

during this same period I went to the gym every weekday; 5 days a week first thing in the morning. Since losing this aspect of my recovery plan, the symptoms of psychomotor agitation have become all consuming. I am covered in bruises from punching myself and bumping into things as the physical symptoms of my anxiety drive me into a visceral panic. I am unable to go on runs due to previous injury, it is hard to find an adequate replacement to weight lifting. 

Finally, I am 113 days sober from drugs and alcohol. My AA meetings have been cancelled and I donâ€™t feel confident about finding a new online meeting that will provide me the support I need. I am struggling to stay sober more now than ever. 

I am posting this because it is difficult to discuss this with my peers. I fear coming across as someone who doesnâ€™t care or believe in Covid. I understand why these measures are in place, but I am scared for myself. I donâ€™t want to fall back in my recovery to the point that I do something I regret.",bipolar_disorder
"I find it hard to justify to myself that the delusions and hallucinations I've felt and seen during episodes are 100% false/ not real. I tend to think they are tied in to some greater meaning I'll find some day. I have 3 main categories of weird:

1: I ""hallucinate"" real things happening - real conversations that people forget after we've talked, real actions people take that they don't remember, real songs that I listen to and can never find again. Live TV starts glitching out like basketball games and such. It looks like the players are on roller skates (not literal skates on their feet) and they have difficulty holding on to the ball. Star wars played the same scene on repeat on TV with commerical inbetween.

2: I ""caused"" real things to happen: me and another patient said ""I think X will happen"" for an entire day, and those exact things happened over and over. Too many times to be coincidence. The key was we had to both agree + think it at the same time.
A. *checks fridge, no apple juice, closes door* ""I think there is apple juice in the fridge"" ""i think so too"" *reaches in eyes closed to the very back, grabs - it is an apple juice. Then I drank it.*
B. ""I think this person will walk forwards, stop, turn left, sit down, write one word, look left, then stand up"" ""i think so too"" *exactly what we said happened*
C. *2pm* ""I think it's dinner time"" ""I think so too"" *I get up for no reason, as if under a spell, and do 3 fast laps around the complex. At the end of the third lap, the dinner cart appeared and it was 5pm*

3: Then there's the category of things I've hallucinated that are obviously hallucinations but still support my beliefs that something weird is happening in the world that doesn't make it real. That we're all under some form of control/being brainwashed. People get taken over with spinning blue eyes like they're under hypnosis. Propaganda/ historical images/animated cartoons flashing in my eyes when I close them - this happened for several hours one night I was having an episode and wasn't sleeping. Voices themselves getting taken over and having a devilish tone - same tone different people. Parents temporarily turning into animated cartoon animals. Hitler mustaches appearing on people.

What the heck am I supposed to do? It's especially hard to let go of the real world glitches I've seen - categories 1 and 2. Do you hold on to anything you've hallucinated as real? How do I either prove or disprove that I'm being controlled/brainwashed when I just get heavily drugged every time I see this stuff?",bipolar_disorder

We met 3 years ago and dated for almost one year until he breakup with me last month. He said that he cannot sustain a relationship if in one month he is bad and on other he is good, that he can't bring security to the relationship and that this is doing harm to him and to me, he said it's not about me, but about him. I understand his reasons, and know how he suffer. I just want to make he feel good, just want to be with him, take care of him, love him. I don't know if I wait some months (his psychiatrist changed his medication shortly before the breakup and he was searching for psychological help at the time) for him to get better and adjust to the medications and therapy and try talk to him, to be together with him again or if I let him go. I don't want to hurt him, make he feel bad or make his situation worse. I want to do the best for him. Help me.",bipolar_disorder
"I feel like there are a few different categories of people when it comes to Bipolar Medications.  Which one (or two) are you (and feel free to make up your own category!)?

&amp;#x200B;

**TGFM (Thank God for Meds!):**  They might not be perfect, but medications have allowed you to live your life fairly normally.

&amp;#x200B;

**Love/Hate Relationship:**  You hate that you rely on medications, but you accept that they are the only reason you are functional.  You know you will have to take them indefinitely, but that doesn't mean you have to like it!

&amp;#x200B;

**Show and Share:**  You have given up being embarrassed by your medications and instead you post about what you take or show off pictures of all of your pills in your hand or maybe in your pill organizers.  If you have to take 'em, might as well eliminate the stigma by sharing all about it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Resigned, At Best**:  You hate medications, but you haven't been able to live without them.  You are always pushing for lower doses, or for trials without them, but as of yet you still need to rely on them to get through the day.

&amp;#x200B;

**All Natural:**  You hate medications, and if you take them, it is only because you have to temporarily.  Optimally, you will only take things that you consider natural.  Screw lithium, but you welcome lithium orotate.  Damn anti-psychotics, but you welcome marijuana in all its forms.",bipolar_disorder
"Hi there, I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a year and a half and she was diagnosed with bipolar when she was a teen. It hasnâ€™t been easy but we come along way. She broke up with me two days ago after a series of two heavy arguments and said she is tired of me and my attitude (I sadly spazzed out on her as she was yelling at me and insulting me because I told her to stay home as she was exposed by covid and I snapped and lost my temper) and is saying she is truly done with me and means it. She has done something similar before where she blocks me on everything and says she is done but normally by next day we resolved it. This time she has deleted pictures of us on her social medias and just says she is done and itâ€™s too late and itâ€™s been two days now. I am texting her off a texting app since she blocked me. What is confusing is she texted my mom yesterday saying she tested positive and wrote her very sweetly like she always does and I went to her house after and she just said same thing she is done with me and Iâ€™m not worth it and wouldnâ€™t talk to me. Her family is telling me to give her some days but I just canâ€™t tell if she truly means it right now or if itâ€™s an episode. She has been stressed and yesterday tested positive so it seems she was angry as well according to her mother.

"I (21F) am currently living in my family home, after a rough 2021. Iâ€™ve seen 4 psychiatrists now, and have confirmed bipolar II. Even so, my parents are convinced that I just have â€™a bit of depression and anxiety, like everyone elseâ€™. Theyâ€™re very against medication, and were pleased when I came off abilify cold turkey. They donâ€™t agree with antidepressants either. So now Iâ€™m unmedicated.

I know that part of the problem is that they donâ€™t know the full extent of my symptoms. They know most of them but Iâ€™m unsure about telling them about behaviours such as SH and drug abuse. I donâ€™t want to destroy my relationship with them. I also have the feeling theyâ€™d chalk that up to some other reason anyway. 

I have a self-help book that was recommended to me by one of the psychiatrists which I showed my mother. However, much of it talked about symptoms I either donâ€™t get at all (like psychosis) or donâ€™t get to that severity. I think it convinced her more that I donâ€™t have it.

Do I try and convince them or do I just let it go? Weâ€™ve had plenty of conversations but the last time we agreed just not to talk about it because it ends up being tense. 

Iâ€™m currently at the beginning of a severe episode of depression after a 2-month long mixed episode. Iâ€™m just so mentally exhausted but they donâ€™t understand. Somehow, theyâ€™re more convinced that itâ€™s long covid than anything else. I donâ€™t have long covid. I just want their support and understanding.

"Hey guys

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently 18 years old, back home visiting from college after my first semester. I love it there, my life overall is good but obviously, my mood does swing here and there as we know, we are bipolar. I broke up with my ex-girlfriend during my first week of college around September. She was the typical fucked up girlfriend you could imagine, a shit load of trauma, full of manipulative tactics, gaslighter, emotionally draining and avoidant-attachment style of love, whilst I was anxiously attached. Don't get me wrong i went through a lot in this relationship, but more so after than during, because when you are manipulated that harshly you only start to learn and realize once you detach from that person, that for me was breaking up with her. I am grateful I went through that because I learned a lot about myself, life and relationships. However, after we broke up a couple of months she fucked her only friend left, who was my close friend. She literally used to call him ugly, make fun of how he was probably closeted, and all this kind of shit. But then she fucks him?! There is nothing to love about either of the people and i DONT UNDERSTAND WHY SHE IS TRYING THIS HARD TO GET TO ME I KNOW SHE ISNT OVER ME BUT THIS SHIT JUST LIVES IN MY HEAD, IM SO FUCKING ANGRY, MY EGO IS HURT, I AM HURT AND I FEEL DISRESPECTED. I am such an accomplished person and Ive done loads for myself yet its always the stupid shit like this that interrupts the momentum of my day. I dont know what to do or think sometimes, all I feel is anger and embarrassment, I truly dont know how to move forward because i have so many healthy thoughts about as well as dangerous temptations to seek revenge. I just really want to move on from the things she did to me and is trying to still, I don't love her anymore, I don't have respect for her anymore, I don't give a fuck if she hangs herself, I don't care, all i want is my own peace because ultimately the only person who will always be in my life is me. Part of me is just shocked she did that because she didnt seem that petty, yes of course she can fuck whoever she wants, she is single, but I know her well, she did that cause he just gave her the slightest bit of attention and she fell for it and on top that she wanted to send me a message. On top all this, he snap chatted me and started telling me how good it was, guys im so fucking angry please help me im so scared of myself. I just cant live with these unhealthy thoughts, I am already working on myself but this is the one thing that stills bothers me. Am I making progress in my life? Of course. But could i do better and move on from this? Of course, I dont know who though.",bipolar_disorder

Can anyone relate?


Ok so, I was just diagnosed with BP1 and PTSD in May 2021 at the age of 25.    (Not the purpose of this post, buuuut it took me getting really sick until I was finally taken seriously).. anyways;

Growing up, I was always so high achieving and hardworking in academics and athletics, and in the back of my head I always thought I was destined for something greater (I think this was the first sign of my predisposition to BP). I didnâ€™t have much of a social life really because I mostly only found self-confidence in my achievements. I wasnâ€™t around many people as a kid and as a teenager who I thought could relate to me. What I committed myself to I was obsessed with, and saw all of my actions as part of this big picture I had in mind for myself. There were other signs of mental illness emerging during this time as well, and in retrospect, def pointed towards BP.   

My parents always were impressed/concerned with how big my hopes and dreams were, but I was reaching these goals and doing incredible things. Buuuut after experiencing so much terrible trauma in university and completely crashing and burning, I became stuck, almost like my mind was in knots. Like a shell of myself. And more symptoms were coming up.

Anyways, now that I am finally on the right meds, I feel like I can move forward, stable but still a bit fragile. That mourning process of lost years is gruelling thoâ€¦ 
Also tons of weed and then dabbling w shrooms (but in a big way)to try and self medicate my gruelling symptoms after just never getting a proper diagnosis, along with my doc tripling my Prozacâ€¦ made me deliriously manic, then hospitalized, now on proper meds. I believe substances got me to that #1 BP diagnostic spotðŸ¤© itâ€™s been a journey, but putting the pieces together is fascinating to me",bipolar_disorder

"Got diagnosed with bipolar disorder recently. After thinking of my anamnesis, I've remembered quite strange thing: after drinking alcohol, waking up and having hangover and then moving to study, I've got something (probably) strange going on: I was extra talkative and happy, some people told me it was strange but I didn't take it seriously, didn't really believe that I can be mentally ill or something like that.   


Even though hungover should be painful, I was feeling extra good. Not without usual physical alcohol hungover effects, of course. Mentally it felt like I was in the middle of carousel of emotions. Recently I've read that some bipolar people got the same... dunno, problem or side-effect?

"Hi y'all, I have a friend whos been having a bit of a rough time lately, and I figured maybe someone here might know how I can better help him. any advice is greatly appreciated.  He's not on Reddit but he gave me permission to post here asking for some advice. I'm not sure whether this breaks rule 7, but if it does I apologize and I will remove it. 

I already wrote a super long post here about a month back, but right as I was finishing my computer crashed and I lost it all. I'll try to be more brief this time, but the situation has changed a little bit since then so I have a few more details to include. 

My friend was initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years back (think late 2019 - early 2020) after he was hospitalized for suicidal ideations and self harm. As far as I know, he doesn't know whether he has bipolar I or II, and he was never really told much about his diagnosis or what it meant. Now he remembers his hospital stay as one of the best times of his life. he was put on medication which he had a great response to. he said he felt happy. Unfortunately, that didn't last long. Soon after he was discharged, his mom got rid of the medication and lied to him. she claimed there was a ""problem"" with their insurance. his mom is very against mental health treatment and honestly she's whats making the situation so much worse. she's controlling, manipulating, and emotionally abusive. everything revolves around her, and she'll do anything to get what she wants. he does have a great relationship with his dad, and he would be supportive of his son getting the help he needs, but his wife absolutely will not allow it. he's also pretty scared to talk to his dad about some of his symptoms because he doesn't want to worry him even more than he already is. 

With that being said, his symptoms are a little bit concerning. especially how quickly they've been getting worse. he has most of the symptoms you'd expect, the depressive episodes and the manic/hypomanic ones (I'm not a doctor so I'm not going to try and speculate which one they are) and all that stuff. what scares both of us the most though I think is the hallucinations. it started with smaller things and it still mostly is, dots in his vision or seeing people or things out of the corner of his eye. he's also heard things as well. I don't know whether these are happening during or outside of manic episodes, and he doesn't either because he doesn't know how to recognize them. however they do seem to be more common when he hasnt gotten as much sleep as he probably should or as he's about to fall asleep, but not always. recently he was also scared someone was watching him. this has happened a few times but this time he was really scared. he said it was a big man behind him, and every way he turned the man would always be behind him. He said the man was trying to kill him and if he put down his phone he would. I've  been trying my best to help him, but it's very difficult especially with the distance, because all I can see are the things he types and if he doesn't type anything I have no way of knowing whats going on. as hard as I can try, there's only so much google can tell me. I'm still a kid, both of us are. at the same time I'm barely holding myself together, and I want to help him but I don't know how. I just wish I could take his pain away.

As for our options, I'm not very hopeful unfortunately. There is absolutely no way he will be able to talk to his mom, and his dad couldn't either. She controls everything, and my friend and his siblings are all on her insurance. His dad has to take anti-anxiety medication, but it's all behind her back because if she knew all hell would break loose. there is one thing that might be able to help though, but we're not really sure how it'd work. earlier this year, our state passed a [new law](https://www.marylandmatters.org/2021/06/14/new-maryland-law-will-expand-adolescents-access-to-mental-health-care/) that allows kids over 12 to get mental health treatment without their parents consent. However, its not really explained anywhere how kids are supposed to find a provider, and providers can legally still tell parents that they are treating their child. since he is also on his mom's insurance, if she happens to check the statement she'll see that there's charges being made there. payment would also be a problem, because of copay. He's trying to get a job but as of right now he has no income. depending on where he could get treatment transportation could be a problem as well. 

Obviously trying to wait it out and getting help when he's 18 is an option, but that could also end very badly. three years is a long time. granted, it's almost two at this point but with the way things are changing who knows what could happen. I just want him to be safe and happy, he's genuinely one of the kindest, smartest, and most hardworking people I've ever met. if anyone's actually made it this far, I can't even begin to thank you. I know this is a really long post, but I tried to include what I thought was important so let me know if you have any questions. I will do whatever it takes to help him. even if it's just something small I can do to make sure he knows that I care about him when he's worried, I greatly appreciate any advice at all. Thank you all :)",bipolar_disorder

"Routine is exceptionally helpful in achieving stability with bipolar disorder. Especially sleep/wake times! I used to have a very strict morning and night routine, and it was one of the few times since diagnosis (and before!) that I was actually balanced and functional. Each time mine breaks (because they do, eventually, break- even for neurotypical people), I try to find the reason why and build my new one with that in mind. Similar, but hopefully better. Sometimes the reason was outside of my control, though.

The struggle is that *building* a routine when youâ€™re depressed, manic, or unorganized can be very difficult, but without that routine itâ€™s hard to come out of an episode. Sort of a catch-22: routine is needed for stability, stability is needed for routine.

Unfortunately i still lack the motivation and ambition required to really make my dreams a reality, and its hard to see that change. i just wish that i had pursued my artistic ambitions before my depression fully took over back when i was younger from around 18 to 21. im more than halfway thru my 20s and my depression gets worse every year, i dont know how to break out of it.",bipolar_disorder

its only day 1 but I don't know how much more I can take. life in general these past two months have been so traumatic and painful, wellbutrin put me in my first psychosis which led to two more psychotic episodes within that week. few weeks later had a thc induced psychosis and since then never stopped hallucinating if I'm not on an AP. The hospital traumatized me this week and put me in so much fucking pain and didn't help me for so long.

"I was going down rabbit holes this weekend about my meds(Prozac, Wellbutrin, Risperidone).  I have had type 2 diabetes since the early 00s, as well as fatty liver.  Never did I put 2 and 2 together to connect fatty liver and my meds.  I knew some of the meds I am/have been on affect blood sugar. But  I assumed it was all just genetics plus my diet for the liver.  But when I found a connection when looking things up and now I'm worried.  My psychiatrist doesn't seem concerned, but my regular doctor has been pushing me for better management of the diabetes.  I just started Trulicity in January and it helps a lot.  

However, all I can think of is statistics for fatty liver and how I'm basically setting myself up for cirrhosis in the future.  Is this a legitimate concern?  Should I really worry that much about this?  I see my gp for a regular check up in May, so I'm definitely going to get his input.  I guess I'm more worried about the Risperidone, as I just started taking it last summer.  It's done wonders for stabilizing my mood, so I don't want to stop it.  But if the risk is worse than the benefit....?  

I guess I just need someone to tell me to stop worrying so much.  I'm at the point where my dr. just keeps an eye on things to make sure it doesn't get worse.  But I feel like you should always think ahead and plan for the worst.",bipolar_disorder

"hey yâ€™all, 
first time posting here but Iâ€™m not sure what to do so hereâ€™s to firsts I guess. Iâ€™m struggling so hard, Iâ€™m pretty sure my BP has progressed into rapid-cycling (went from manic to depressive in the span of a week) and the depressive episodes are getting worse and worse. I havenâ€™t been on meds in a few years bc for about 2.5 I was doing alright but then lifeâ€™s been a rollercoaster the past 6-7 months and itâ€™s âœ¨startedâœ¨ again. I used to take seroquel and lamictal but the seroquel was causing me to pass out and faintâ€”I actually got a concussion one of the times I fainted. I tried to talk to my old dr abt it but I never got referred out, and then I tried Cerebral but they fucked me and never perscribed me anything after spending money on the service so I feel like whenever I do ask for help/try to get help itâ€™s for Jack shit. I have a new doctor now but idk if heâ€™s going to be able to perscribe me anything for my BP and heâ€™s had to refer me out twice for my sprained ankle and he never did (itâ€™s been 3 weeks now) so if he canâ€™t perscribe anything for my BP and I need to see a psychiatrist, Iâ€™m scared for myself that I wonâ€™t be able to wait that long and have to potentially wait even longer if he never sends out the referral. Idk what Iâ€™m asking for really, I guess tips on what to do? And do meds actually help? I feel like I canâ€™t remember what it was like to be on them, do you finally feel normal again? My soul is so exhausted I canâ€™t do this shit anymore, the BP has drained everything out of me. I obviously wonâ€™t be able to call the office til Monday and give or take a few days for the actual appointment so do you know what I can do for myself until then? I feel like whenever I try to soothe myself during depressive episodes it doesnâ€™t help. Ie I went to take my dogs to sit outside and I ended up tripping in the street and losing the last money I had to my name Iâ€™ve been trying to think of things that give me relief but nothing does. I love my pets but theyâ€™ve been a huge stress for me lately so I just get irritated thinking about it. Thereâ€™s not a thing about my apartment I enjoy it feels like a prison in a layer of hell designed for me; it is the main source of my anxiety and depression tbh. Would love to go out and go somewhere but that takes gas and Iâ€™m too depressed to go into the club and talk to men to make money. Donâ€™t have anything saved because Iâ€™ve been out on a sprained ankle. Canâ€™t even treat myself to a coffee to get a slight buzz of dopamine. Plus when Iâ€™m in an episode I borderline get agoraphobia so going outside and walking downtown where there a shit ton of people is super hard for me. Iâ€™m so ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜© rn

*and a bit of background below, if you'd like:*

i am mostly asking since i will be discussing with my psychiatrist next week if i fit the bill for bipolar 2 or not. i wanted to discuss this with her since i'm pretty sure trying wellbutrin for my ADHD and depression made me hypomanic, and i had to go off it completely after about 18 days. somehow i started learning more about what antidepressants can do to people with bipolar disorder, and i resonated with experiencing hypomania and the crashes of depression right after. this made me research even more about bipolar disorder, and now i'm beginning to question if i have it, since i noticed that i frequently experience this mood cycles.

iâ€™m an 18 year old med student. i was diagnosed 2 years ago. iâ€™ve lived in 2 countries during these years and doctors from both countries have diagnosed me as bipolar. i used antipsychotics like aripiprazole and seroquel, antidepressants, trileptal, lamotrogineâ€¦ but iâ€™m not getting any results.
iâ€™m not the kind of person who expects meds to work magically, so i completely changed my lifestyle: i have a routine, i wake up early, study, work out, try to maintain a social life despite my heavy work loadâ€¦ but iâ€™m still not stable. the highs are very high but the lows are very low. itâ€™s so frustrating and exhausting. 
the side effects of these medications are ruining my life and my body. i had countless health issues caused by my meds. if they worked and made me stable i wouldnâ€™t complain, but iâ€™m honestly just exhausted at this point.

"So I recently started seeing a new doctor. She is probably the best I've seen since being diagnosed with BPD. She spends a hour with me each visit (and I still see my therapist once a week too) ans we talk about my stress factors, how I feel on my meds, what my goals are and she actually cares and explains options to me and gives me a choice with her ideas. It's honestly been an amazing experience because I have never felt like a real person since seeing a psych. 

Recently we did some testing and found out I am ADHD, she informed me there is a high comorbility rate between BPD and ADHD. She started me on Vyvanse and it has worked great in combo with my Trileptal.  I feel like I can focus again, I don't find myself word finding alot and just in general I feel calmer with it (and have some increased energy too). Overall I feel like I'm starting to make some progress on being stable and feel like I have a support system between my doctor, therapist, husband, brother and sister.

I donâ€™t have any friends. I donâ€™t like spending time with people. Thereâ€™s this guy that I really like and he likes me too, but he deserves better. I know he doesnâ€™t think badly of me, but we work together (at our on campus university restaurant), and even though he thinks Iâ€™m pretty, he probably thinks Iâ€™m a ditz.

"Hello! I(24F) want to have a conversation with my friends (one guy, one girl) about my behaviour in a way that is constructive without sounding like ""pity me"" or an excuse. 

Amongst my two friends, I am known as the ""flaky"" one. I only found this out recently when they got mad at me for not going with them to an overnight LAN party. (Really it was only my guy friend that openly was irritated with me but I think my girl friend was too since they seemed to have a talk about me before telling me I was flaky.) It really hurt my feelings because they know I have bipolar disorder and they also know I'm financially fucked right now and desperately looking for a job.  I didn't want to go to the overnight thing because I knew I didn't have the money and I didn't want to screw my sleep schedule over (I just got it kinda fixed). They (again only rlly the guy openly but my girl friend doesn't stand up for me) also made snide jokes about me not being ready to move out of my mom's house and in with them. 

I have this little habit that I'm sure some of you also have where I make a lot of unrealistic plans when I'm in a manic state. So I tend to be the one in our friend group who plans out events and things but I'm also the one who usually can't attend these events due to money issues or depression. I was the one who brought up moving in together before the pandemic while I was in a manic state. Then the pandemic hit and I lost my job (my only source of income) and fell into a deep depression. In the last two years, ive fallen heavily into debt and behind pay for rent and utilities. I've been surviving mostly with the support of my mom :) but my friends made comments about it like ""oh of course she won't move out ðŸ™„. She rather live with her mom."" or stuff similar to this. It's very condescending imo.... They act like I'm some sort of mess (even though I'm the only one able to hold a job for longer than 2 years and I'm the only one that can easily make friends... Ok that was bitchy of me ðŸ‘€ I apologize but I hate the way they're making me feel recently.)

I know it's not right of me to make plans I can't follow thru with which is why when I make plans I try to make them as broad as possible... for example when I made plans for us to do an art class together I said specifically ""in the future, when we are all ready"", but I just found out today they took that as literally next week so they booked class places without me and when I asked them why they did that they said ""well we knew you'd flake so we didn't bother."" It really hurt. They knew I wanted to do it together, it was literally the only reason I made the plans... They also know I don't have the money and I'm looking for a job but it feels like they low-key don't even consider any of my issues when they're mad at me. 

I like my friends. I think they're very fun about 90% of the time, which is why when they do fucked up things or piss me off I always try to understand why they did it and come to an understanding. But this? Idk it seems like time and time again they're unwilling to understand me. I understand what I do is probably annoying which is why I've been actively changing it and I might even be the in the wrong in this whole situation but I want to be able to explain myself without them feeling defensive or like I'm being defensive. I don't want it to sound like I'm using my bipolar disorder as a defense but I want them to know that it LITERALLY is because of my disorder and im trying to get better. I've stopped making definite plans and instead I make very broad open future ambitions I want to share with them but its them who takes it as a very literal ""RIGHT now we have to do that""... and it's always me who gets left out then told off for not being there.

Sorry if this was confusing! I can clear up any confusion in the replies. 

TLDR: my friends call me flaky for my manic planning then depression fall out. I want to explain to them that they're hurting my feelings without it being an attack on them. (Ie: how to have constructive conversations for dummies)

Ps: don't know if this is really relevant but I'm also autistic and sometimes I feel like that puts a wall between my friends and me. Again, they know I'm bipolar and autistic.",bipolar_disorder

"Things are going too well &amp; it kind of scares me. I'm very stable right now on my current regimen (Lithium, Lamictal, Prozac). I haven't had a hospital stay in over 2 years. I'm thriving at work. I haven't had anything worse than a mild dip in my mood in months. I don't remember the last time I had a morning where I couldn't get out of bed. My last hypomanic episode was when I first started Prozac, which was over a year ago.

I should be so happy about that &amp; I *am* happy about it, I'm not complaining, but it also gives me a degree of anxiety. I just feel like I'm always a little bit on edge just waiting for shit to hit the fan like it usually has in the past. I was cranky yesterday because a close friend of mine is in the hospital after a bad injury (she's going to be okay I think, don't worry). I started freaking out ""omg why am I cranky? Am I becoming depressed? Should I be worried? What do I do? What if I destabilize &amp; end up in the hospital? It definitely puts a damper on my peace.

I know it sounds stupid &amp; I should just be happy I'm doing well but I'm doing so well that I'm terrified of losing that. Anyone relate?

"Iâ€™m having a rough time, and Iâ€™m just struggling to see how it gets better.

My birthday is tomorrow, and as I reflect on the last several years, I canâ€™t help but to ask â€œwhat the fuck am I doing with my life?â€

I was hospitalized in 2017.  I was 32 at the time, completely broke, $10k+ in credit card debt, student loans, and I quit my job prior to going into the hospital.  I had to move back home to live with my sister because I had no other option.  Certainly grateful I had a place to go, but it was one of the last things I ever wanted to do.

I managed to get a job about 3 months after moving back in with my sister.  Was determined to get out of debt and was working my ass off.   Through determination and hard work, I managed to make almost $100k, paid off all my credit cards, was making progress on my student loans, living by myself, and bought a car for the first time in my life.

In June of 2020 I get the great idea to go out on my own.  I leave the company Iâ€™m working with, and in a matter of a few months I blow throw the couple thousand dollars I had saved and max all my credit cards paying my rent and living expenses.

Now itâ€™s 2022, Iâ€™m in more debt than I was in 2017, owe money to the IRS, have lost basically all my friends, and havenâ€™t been in a relationship for 7 years.  Depending on how things go the next month or two, Iâ€™m potentially looking at moving back in with my parents or my sister.  

I just donâ€™t know what to do at this point.  If I didnâ€™t have a supportive family I probably wouldnâ€™t be here right now.  I know I have it in me to get back on my feet, but I canâ€™t help but wonder if itâ€™s even worth it.  Is my life bound to be a cycle of recovery and complete destruction?  The sad thing is I have no one to blame but myself.  My own decisions have put me here. 

Iâ€™m just at a loss.  I know I should try, and I know I should care; but to be honest it doesnâ€™t even feel worth it.  It feels like anything I get Iâ€™m destined to lose.",bipolar_disorder

"For 6 weeks running I've been bad-tempered, hair triggered, and mean spirited to my S.O. I've been oversensitive, reactive, and nasty. Having difficulty empathizing. Emotional in general - getting watery eyed easily. It just sneaks up on me out of nowhere.

It didn't even occur to me that maybe my recent bad attitude was not, in fact, a reasonable/valid reaction to what's been going on between us and in our life. But maybe actually just the result of an episode. Didn't occur until he said last night ""I don't know whats going on with you right now but you are not yourself. Something is up."" This after I blew completely up over a small shitty thoughtless comment he had made. Like, ALL the way up.

First I immediately accused him of trying to gaslight me. But I spent a night and a day thinking about it and he may well be right.

hi. so iâ€™m diagnosed with bipolar II, but i feel i might have been misdiagnosed and be borderline instead. a therapist suggested it and said i should look into it, and it aligns much more with me than bipolar. i havenâ€™t gotten re-evaluated so i donâ€™t want to self diagnose, which is why iâ€™m posting this on r/bipolar!

anyway, for 6 years in my teens, i only knew intense and abusive relationships. i never had a healthy relationship, and i never got to see one. my mom is bipolar as well, and long story short, she wasnâ€™t exactly the greatest role model for relationships. so iâ€™m pretty much lost.

iâ€™ve been with my current s/o for nearly a year, and the beginning was great! heâ€™s kind, considerate, patient, and understanding. heâ€™s perfect for me. but iâ€™m not sure if iâ€™m perfect for him. i feel like damaged goods, and i feel like iâ€™ve been conditioned by my past groomers/abusers to be used to volatile relationships. now that iâ€™m in the steadiest relationship of my life, i feel like self sabotaging. i keep getting urges to do or say things to him that i obviously shouldnâ€™t. i guess iâ€™m feeling underwhelmed now that iâ€™m in a relationship without fights and abuse. iâ€™m getting annoyed more easily, and i donâ€™t want to. i was so used to constant fighting. the lows were insanely low but the highs were high enough to keep me in bad relationships. but heâ€™s the sweetest guy iâ€™ve ever met, and i genuinely love him. heâ€™s my best friend.

i donâ€™t know what to do. i donâ€™t want to tell him about my feelings because i donâ€™t want to hurt him. the last thing i want to do i make him feel how others have made me feel.

How many years after your first Bipolar Dx did a psychiatrist refer to your Bipolar as ""Treatment Resistant""?

Do you feel like your mania is more resistant to treatment, your depression, or both?


Which of these treatments have you tried for your Bipolar (and feel free to discuss your experiences)?

*Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
*Lithium

I first met her after she got out of the hospital for a suicide attempt, just prior to being diagnosed with bipolar.  We became very close but never romantic, more best friends.  I had feelings for her but she was always romantically involved with someone, so I never said anything.  None of her romantic relationships ever worked out due to her bipolar btw.

Anyways, fast forward 16 years and she recently became single and since I was also single, I decided to finally tell her how I had always felt about her.  It was a dream come true for about two weeks after.  She was hypersexual so that was quite the experience.  Then, out of the blue, she completely cut me out of her life.  No calls, no texts, no emails.  I haven't heard from her in going on two months.

I doubt there is anything I can do.  I feel that by having that two week fling with her, I've completely ruined our 16 year friendship.  I know this is her bipolar.  I'm really depressed and hope I see best friend again one day.

My problem is that I tend to invalidate my experiences a lot because I don't really have visible reactions. I believe that I have strong self control in most situations, and I constantly refrain myself from acting on my urges in all my romantic/friend relationships.


I cycle through emotions of anxiety, jealousy, possessiveness; and at the same time, I feel like I have so much love and joy to give â€“ more than what anyone can give me. Yet, I am able to rationalize the extremity of my emotions very well and find a balance in the way I act toward people without ever showing anyone what I am truly feeling. 


This makes my ""episodes"" almost unnoticeable to others, until I eventually reach my tipping point and burst, which happens quite rarely. I've been told ""this is not like you"" far too often to the point that it's become a catchphrase for others to use on me. I walk away from conflict as much as possible because I am afraid of losing control and saying things I don't want to say. So I understand why people get surprised when I speak my mind for once.

"Hello! :) from your neighbor ASD communities. So, I don't have a bipolar diagnosis (though for a while my shrinks were considering it, perhaps cyclothymia, never diagnosed though) I don't think I have bipolar disorder itself, as I don't see any of the typical patterns in me except for when I take meds like SSRI (in which case I start hallucinating, talking fast, high libido etc.) . But SSRIs malfunctioning isn't uncommon for ASD people either so IDK. 

However, there is ONE thing I realize - when I am unmedicated, and I feel exhausted due to busy life circumstances, before I know it I start doing a lot of stupid things and getting into fights, etc. My mind seems to be a little more ""all over the place"" than usual too. Particularly when the busy season is over - as if I was running full speed and then there is no road anymore and I crash. I don't know if it's an autism thing (had to get used to the busy routine, and now that it's over it's hard to go back to a normal rhythm) or if anyone with an actual bipolar disorder diagnosis experiences anything like ""hypo/mania due to exhaustion"" . It's very uncomfortable. I am back to taking CBZ so I hope it will go away in a while, but I was wondering if anyone else feels it.

"This post is just mainly sharing to the anonymous cloud, because I need a forum to collect my thoughts. Forgive me for the rambling nature. 

So I imagine many of us here have childhood trauma. Since I think bipolar disorder is both genetic and environmental. I tend to connect strongly with others that have been abused physically or mentally early in life. Sometimes itâ€™s a crazy strong connection and you donâ€™t really know what challenges they are still facing from it. I am trying me hardest not to put the cart before the horse in this new relationship thatâ€™s being formed. Since we have only hung out 5 times. I try remind myself I donâ€™t really know them. But all I want do is be around this person constantly. I feel I could get lost in them. I told them I donâ€™t want to see them for a couple days because of this and they responded they feel the same way. But we have already planned to do a multiple night trip together in a couple of weeks. 

I worry that we are so into each other is because both our last relationships were fairly abusive and in the end so unloving. So the small gestures that we have done for each other already mean way too much, because we havenâ€™t experienced someone bringing us flowers and taking us out to a nice dinner or giving us the ingredients and a the extra steamer to make the Asian dish we have always wanted to try. 

Those small things make me cry, because I have felt so unloved and not accepted for so long. Like I had to constantly be on guard and put what I want aside to avoid upsetting a person for them to be kind to me and not say mean things. 

And all I want to do is be with this person and not screw it up. Because I know my dark side can come out when I feel rejected and I hate that dark side. 

So anyway, how do you keep things in perspective and not just fall for someone instantly? Iâ€™m really trying not to get too attached and try to take it slow as possibly but when we kiss I get lightheaded and dizzy. And everything just feels so good right now. Like the day I got to spend with them was the best day Iâ€™ve had in a long time. I know Iâ€™m probably putting them on a pedestal and Iâ€™m just waiting to see their issues manifest. 

But I already feel I love this person even though I barely know them. I feel so safe with them even though I barely know them.  

So how do I stop this feeling and just take things slow?",bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™ve been doing ALOT of unnecessary research (digging into the history of my family,my religion, the church, racism, our county, social issues etc) and I think itâ€™s finally triggered a manic episode. 
Ive been on meds for about 4 years but went off on Feb because it was giving me heart palpitations. I would be sleep and wake up with my heart racing but the meds would make me sleepy so It would be hard to sleep. This became more frequent and produced anxiety attacks which scared me from sleeping so I REALLY didnâ€™t sleep and ended up just going off my meds..

Lately Iâ€™ve recognized a change in myself and itâ€™s kind of scary (I feel myself becoming more irritable, mean, spiritual, sensitive to others, driving fast, listening to a lot of music, sleeping less, having more ideas etc,) and I KNOW I NEED MEDS but I donâ€™t want to go back on the meds because they made me super unhealthy (gained weight loss 30 pounds since Iâ€™ve been off meds). 

But now.. I canâ€™t sleep. My subconscious runs wild in my sleep and Iâ€™m up every hour. It feels like Iâ€™m awake in my sleep. Iâ€™m having more nightmares. Iâ€™m tired but getting by with little to no sleep.

Mentally Iâ€™m sick. Last time I felt like this I just took some Benadryl for a couple days and told myself I need more rest and to find a therapist.

Does anyone have any holistic ways of getting some good nights rest when your having a manic episode? I donâ€™t want to have to call my psychiatrist because they will just give me another pill and Iâ€™m worried about getting a therapist because financially a good therapist is expensive. I feel bad for my partner who currently having to deal with my up and down mood swings. And physically I feel burnt out and tired.",bipolar_disorder

When someone is mad at me or I do something wrong itâ€™s never easy to forget. I stays in my clouded mind for months on end. My brain replaying ever moment of sadness. Itâ€™s where my mania starts to come into play. The image of everyone in this world hating me makes me want to lash out in anger and self harm.

I used to think a girl/boyfriend would make the pain go away, but when I graduated high school I realized how terrible that idea would be. I will be alone forever.

"Iâ€™m a 39 year old bipolar woman engaged to a wonderful man who loves, cherishes, and adores me as much as I do for him. Things are good there. Iâ€™m very lucky and Iâ€™ve gotten to where I can see that and appreciate it. He knows Iâ€™m bipolar and accepts me for it anyway. Heâ€™s an amazing guy. Iâ€™m currently on a cocktail of medication: lamictal, Rexulti, Propranalol, Wellbutrin XR, and Modafanil. I have Klonipin to take when I need it as well as hydroxine for less extreme circumstances. I only mention these things to give a complete picture. :)

Iâ€™ve been cycling through moods like someone channel surfing. Iâ€™m happy and things are good but then my fiancÃ© says something that I normally wouldnâ€™t take offense to, and Iâ€™m a huge mess in tears and completely overreacting. In the very back of my mind, I know Iâ€™m overreacting but itâ€™s like that knowledge is overridden by the emotions of that moment, if that makes sense? I get angry easily. Itâ€™s not violent anger (very rarely do I get to such a state; you have to know how to set me off). Iâ€™m not throwing things and screaming like a banshee. I just seem to take offense to every freaking thing said to me. Iâ€™m sleeping fine. If anything, sleep is a refuge for me becauseâ€¦..

My narcissistic mother has gotten to the point to where my sister and I are seriously wishing she would go into a nursing home (my mom is 70). Mom is a story in and of herself. Sheâ€™s the only who ever so graciously gave me my emotional issues (which according to her come from my father). She is a rain cloud hanging over my otherwise sunny life, pelting me with raindrops full of misery, dismay, depression, and dislike for anything that displeases her (which is about every other second). She has always been this way but never to this point. I feel like sheâ€™s draining the life from my soul and I donâ€™t know how to make it stop without telling her to F-off. 

I know Iâ€™m not the only one who has thought to themselves about the irony of being the one on medication and in therapy when it seems like someone else needs it more.

Iâ€™m going to see my psychiatrist this coming Friday, and weâ€™re leaving afterwards for a lovely weekend vacation at the beach. That following Monday, I start a great job working from home. There is a lot of good in my life right now. Thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t get where these mood swings are coming from. I canâ€™t sit still without doing something. Weâ€™re completely caught up on laundry (itâ€™s even put away which is pretty huge for me, I admit) because I canâ€™t just lounge around with my fiancÃ© and relax. The only reason Iâ€™m able to lay on our bed right now is because Iâ€™m furiously typing away on my phone.

So hereâ€™s a question that I feel I should be able to answer myself after 22 years of having a bipolar diagnosis: is it possible that the stress my mother has put upon me has induced a slight bit of hypomania? My mania is stress reactive at times so it would make sense. I just donâ€™t have the crazy racing thoughts, insomnia, and euphoria of pure mania. 

I apologize for the venting. I know my fiancÃ© loves me and he does listen to me, but he doesnâ€™t quite understand the fear of mania that other bipolar individuals have. If youâ€™ve read this far, thank you for listening. â¤ï¸",bipolar_disorder

I do have periods of depression that involve past suicide attempts. But I am not sure if these other things are mania.

An example of a previous episode that might have been mania involved me going nights without sleep. I lost my appetite too. I would eat once or twice a week. I did have periods where I was sleeping with up to 10 to 15 partners a week. I became angry and explosive on everyone around me. I suddenly quit my job.

I was like, wow, have my meds finally kicked in? But it didn't last long, fast forward to Wednesday, and that high feeling was nowhere to be found.

I just lie around all day and I really need help with getting up and moving myself around.

I havenâ€™t taken my Invega injection for over a month, with doctor supervision. We will revisit it at the next appointment. I take 10mg Fluoxetine, 15 mg of Adderall which was lowered to 10 mg last week, and smoke medical marijuana.

I was only diagnosed with bipolar after being hospitalized for psychosis. It didnâ€™t specify if it was 1 or 2.",bipolar_disorder
"I've been meaning to ask or share this before but I forgot to do it, anyway, even before I was diagnosed with Bipolar Type 1 I really had a hard time dating. Or maybe it's just because of my poor decision making or me being impulsive. So last year, I met a guy, he was nice at first and I thought maybe he's ""the one"" or I may have convinced myself to just whatever let's take a chance and see where this thing will go. And so I tried dating him, I didn't commit to him yet because I'm still not sure if I really want to.

But he insisted that we commit now to a serious relationship and maybe get married next year (which was supposedly this year) but I got so overwhelmed that he is rushing things, I am also a single mom to a 6 year old boy and he hadn't met my son but he's already trying to make decisions on my behalf. Anyways, in those 11 months that I am talking to him everyday I am triggered to get angry or to go on a rage. I am taking my medicines diligently but the slightest thing can set me on a rage and pick a fight with him. And I started harming myself and be destructive, it first started with punching my laptop, throwing my phone, punching the wall, then destroyed my eyeglasses, pull out a lot of hair, tried to strangle my neck which gave me bruises that I had to hide from my family, then punched my left leg until it turned black and blue from the bruises then the right leg next, I hear voices telling me to harm my sister and my son, or to harm other people which I never experienced in the past and the last one was breaking a glass cup on my head which gave me 2 stitches and 5 stitches on my pinky finger. I was afraid to leave him at first because he's always saying that he'll die if I do, or whenever we're fighting he'll say that he can breathe and when I ask him what does he want he'll say that committing to him will make him better and I felt so guilty that I just go on with it even if I was on a depressive episode every day. But last month, I finally had enough and I finally cut ties with him and so far right now, I haven't had any episode where I would want to harm myself or even think about it. I don't know but I just realized that there are really people that are bad for our mental health and we should have the courage to cut them off. I just have to get this out of my chest.

"Depression is a disease that is inverse to nature. It asks you to plunge into the darkness when you want to see the light. It makes you hate yourself when all you want is peace. It forces you to abandon the pursuit of happiness in trade of self-destruction. It keeps you down when all you want to be is up. And it screams to kill yourself against our inner nature to survive. 

Recognizing the absurdity of depression can be the first step forward in recovering.

Progress starts with small victories. When depression tells you to give up, fight back. Take a shower. Clean your place. See your friends and family. Most importantly, survive. 

Weâ€™re all in this together â€” hereâ€™s to the small victories. â¤ï¸",bipolar_disorder

My mother (BP 2) was really depressive after a covid infection and her psychiatrist prescribed an antidepressant. It fixed her mood for 3 weeks (maybe a little bit caused hipomania too) but now this week she is in depressive mode again.

Now that sheâ€™s gone, I fear for the times I will be home alone not liking anything I watch or listen to. I get panicked and feel abandoned. I realize how sad this is since Iâ€™m an adult and shouldnâ€™t need my mom anymore, but Iâ€™ve said yes to all of her invites and have forgotten how to be alone.

"Hey yâ€™all. 

Not sure where to begin. But, long story short, I met someone three months ago and began a relationship about a month ago. It has been great fun. I enjoy her deeply and see her as the type of person I could fall in love with. 

But. 

She is simply not well. After some time she shared that she is both actively suicidal and battling an eating disorder. She is not in medication nor is she seeing a therapist with any regularity. 

Money is the barrier here, rather than desire, but sheâ€™s also chosen to arrange her life to study abroad in the coming months (meaning she chose that as more important to spend on than seeking help to recover). 

Anyway. 

Much of our time is spent with me nursing her moods. Iâ€™m quite good at it, Iâ€™ve been suicidal myself and am quite empathetic, but I can already tell that long term with someone in her headspace would drain me. 

Iâ€™m in the head space where Iâ€™m ready to find my person settle down and do the marriage thing. Sheâ€™s actively interested in dying. Thatâ€™s no place to start a long lasting relationshipâ€¦ right?

How do you know if the meds are working or if you are just naturally coming out of an episode?

I will also add there was psychosis in this depressive episode as well.  I eventually came out of that episode and was stable for quite some time. 

Since this illness is nuerodigenerative though, my episodes have become a lot longer and still zero response from the medication. My back is now seized up due to Zyprexa and I have Covid as well. Honestly? I hope the Covid takes me out. Back on Trileptal because hey I tolerated it well but never found stability.

"I was diagnosed bipolar about 4 years ago. My aunt on my mothers side is bipolar and my father is also diagnosed with bipolar. Ever since I have been on my medication, trileptal, I had been doing a lot better. Still struggling, but better. 

My fiancÃ© and I (he is an absolutely wonderful man) were trying for our first child. I am 28 and he is 29. I had never been pregnant before. On March 31 I texted positive for being pregnant. I was over the moon. I immediately met with my psychiatrist who told me to stop taking my trileptal cold Turkey and said he â€œhopes nothing has already happened to the babyâ€ since trileptal is not proven safe for pregnancy. 

On April 6 I called my doctor due to some spotting and was directed to the ER. That day, I was diagnosed with a â€œcomplete miscarriageâ€ by the doctor. I was an absolute wreck. Screaming and crying in the parking lot. I thought spotting in early pregnancy was normal. 

3 days later I returned to see my OBGYN. After speaking with me and taking my blood, they concluded they I was only in early pregnancy and thatâ€™s why my HCG levels were so low. I was told I did not have a miscarriage and my levels were rising, and to return in a few days. 

On April 13 I received a call from the OBGYN office. They said if I had any cramping or bleeding whatsoever, to go to the ER. Almost immediately after the call, I began experiencing the worst pain in my right side Iâ€™ve ever had. 

I rushed home from work and my fiancÃ© took me to the ER. The pain was so sharp I began to throw up and cry and scream during the short ride. Once at the ER, I was given the usual tests again along with ultrasounds. 

I was told I was experiencing an ectopic pregnancy and needed to get a methotrexate treatment immediately so that my tube did not burst. The next day, I was sent to another ER to finally terminate my pregnancy. I was reassured this is all completely normal and not my fault and thereâ€™s nothing that I did wrong. 

After the treatment I was pushed into a miscarriage where I was extremely physically ill for weeks. Going to the bathroom was an absolute nightmare. I do not want to go into too much detail here in the physical things I experienced, but I do feel traumatized. Emotionally I was an absolute wreck. I truly believe I probably should I checked myself in to an inpatient which would have been my first time, but I wanted to stay strong. I cried and cried and laid here for days. I couldnâ€™t move. 

I was told by a nurse that my psychiatrist should have weened me off of my trileptal. Mind you, I experienced all of this while not taking my medication. 

After all of this I returned to get back on my trileptal and was also given 20mg Prozac. 

I owe thousands of dollars in medical bills. Each of my copays for the ERâ€™s are 1100$. I donâ€™t even know how much I owe in total and they have been calling me and emailing me since 2 weeks after my treatment. 

I feel like a zombie. I am able to get things done like go to work, clean, eat, normal human things. No sex drive, no feelings, no will to talk to my family or friends. Emotionless. I can typically cry very easy but now I canâ€™t at all. I donâ€™t feel sad or mad or happy. Just nothingness. Itâ€™s like a part of me left when my baby left.

"So, Aside from blowing up a 4 year relationship in my mania, the lows have been what has predominantly stifled my life, (I can even attribute the source of that end of one of my Luvâ€™s to her perceived laziness of me) But the lows are the foundation which has formulated all types of bad habits that turned into coping mechanisms. I call them my endorphin buttons. I am Definitely not lazy, the mania brings out my ambition for sure but the long crash after acts like a reset for it all. I was diagnosed Bi-Polar in my late 20â€™s and Iâ€™m lucky that my career up till now is extremely flexible and I networked myself and put myself in a position to succeed, and yet I havenâ€™t. Financially Iâ€™m pretty far back, my goals havenâ€™t been reached and I just keep procrastinating. even as a write this Iâ€™m procrastinating. Iâ€™ll admit I lost all my ambition for a few years when I was diagnosed. I could at least put a â€œwhyâ€ behind my patterns. So I figured, â€œfuck itâ€ I know my tendencies just let it all go for a while and be ok with existing and figure out how to deal with my being. Fast forward after a few years. Medication took away the constant brain fog till 3pm and I started to feel like I wanted to put more on my plate only this time I knew not to put it all on myself. I got better at â€œmentallyâ€ delegating. 
Basically I knew who I could bring on board to help me out instead of wanting to do everything myself like the perfectionist my head wants. 

So many services exist to streamline process and Iâ€™m all about finding ways to â€œMin-Maxâ€.

2020 was actually a huge gift in time for me that felt squandered. So many ppl I knew were out of work and thirsty for a project and I had it all in my head ready to make my project happenâ€¦

And I didnâ€™t. 

I figured I had way more time and got lost in bad habits instead. I recently looked up different types of procrastination and I do all of them. It sucks. I tell myself Iâ€™m about to do something and I donâ€™t do it. It gets put off to the next day a week later Iâ€™ve lost all time from that week and I go wtf I was doing something that someone on YouTube set up in 5 hours and Iâ€™m not even done, 1 and a half months later. I donâ€™t even have a 9-5 job right now. I literally take work when I want and can actually make a live able wage working half as much as most ppl partly because Iâ€™ve avoided all responsibilities in my life. I could get a normal job but It would only be for a routine and I kind of think itâ€™s a dumb way to go about it when I can just pick up more work in my field. Iâ€™ve left 3 consecutive places because family and friends enabled me to get away from even more responsibilities. Or at least that was my reasoning for a little while. (Side note: seriously I thank my lucky stars and am blessed by the grace of fucking god for these people and I am grateful, Iâ€™d rather pick up a spare bedroom and cover ppls bills then pay some asshole or management company a fucking dime, just clean up after yourself and make dinner for ppl and â€œmostâ€ is forgiven) but Iâ€™ve squandered my time and itâ€™s embarrassing. I donâ€™t know where my life has gone. Granted I have some awesome stories and have lived a life so far that when I am not in this hole is pretty rad and I want to be that person all the time. But like what the fuck man. This procrastination shit is like the bane of my existence. Itâ€™s eaten up so much of my life that the weeks that went by werenâ€™t weeks, they were months that added up into years.  Literally when I sit down anything that agitates me more than 30mins I walk away and donâ€™t pick it up for another 3 hours come back it pisses me off for 10 minutes and I leave it for a day only to find out after someone shows me that I was uploading a file in the wrong spot, or  changed a setting by mistake that fucks with an entire process. Also it takes me longer to do regular tasks even when I am focused. 

Last month I procrastinated so bad that the thing Iâ€™m going to do today I start at 1am and had to pass out at 7am the next day. Itâ€™s like I decided to give up on that day but change time zones in my sleep schedule to be ahead the next day. My sleep schedule was fucked for 3 weeks. 

Sleep is one of if not the most important thing to do. Way to go me. 

Iâ€™ve heard everything too. You need a schedule, remove distractions, eat healthy, work out. I fucking tell ppl this and yet itâ€™s so fucking hard to stay consistent with it. I swear I fucking try and I still am trying. (Enter Yoda telling me there is no try only do or do not. little green Grover motherfucker)  God fucking help me if I have some random idiot hear me vent and say â€œjust take it easyâ€ because thatâ€™s
Alcohol of my addiction, thanks Guy.  Iâ€™m not giving up but fuck me, WHY CANâ€™T I JUST FINISH like so many others I know who can grind till itâ€™s done. I hate these fucking lows. They tap me the fuck out when I get into routines. Now, here I am staring at squandered resources forced to make hard decisions I wouldnâ€™t have to had I just fucking finished 1 or 2 of the projects that would have got me just so much farther. I wouldnâ€™t even be so angry right now if they failed, at least theyâ€™d be done. Hell I know I could even be a fucking millionaire. Although Iâ€™d stop at figuring out the formula for 6 figures doing the bare minimum and continue my lifeâ€™s goal of being my own version of Indiana Jones. Donâ€™t get me wrong. In my mind if I needed to grind 6 years of my life to get there in the 1st place I would or at least would have mentally. But guess what 10 years went by,â€¦well fuck me sideways and those â€œnewâ€ health problems ppl bitch about when they arenâ€™t in their 20â€™s anymore. 

Everyday is a new day, recognize your faults and mitigate the procrastination, avoid my pitfalls. The minimum is good enough compared to putting it off till never because perfection is the enemy progress. And with the bare minimum At least then there is something to come back to. 

Get into â€œthe routineâ€ and when it falls apart. Eat it and do it again. What else?? See someone so they can tell me what I embarrassingly already know. Fuck these lows and the shit habits they helped me cultivate. Iâ€™m actually at a point to where I feel like I need to take extreme measures to break this shit. Oh yeah, donâ€™t berate yourself kids. It doesnâ€™t help. 

Look, I know itâ€™s doable. I wonâ€™t give up. Literally I think I need to hold myself at gunpoint. 

TL/DR

Iâ€™m venting. Lows are a breeding grounds for bad habits, Iâ€™m recognizing how terribly bad they are later on in my life. Find anyway you can to mitigate them.  They keep popping up even when Iâ€™m in good routines and I let them win. Easy Dopamine is one helluva drug. No, I donâ€™t give up and that isnâ€™t supposed to be some inspirational bullshit. It just means Iâ€™m stubborn. 

Also please Donâ€™t feel sorry for my bad habits literally Iâ€™m a grown ass stubborn man just making bad choices of inaction at this point in my life to where Iâ€™m dealing with consequences of my own doing. Iâ€™m literally on a journey at this point to find as many dopamine detox methods as I can and hope that acts as a reset and not a purge to the binge.

"Anyone else here also out of work because of their bipolar and feel *really disproportionately bad about it?*

I don't know how common it is for other bipolar folks to not be able to work, but I'm 22 and have only held a job for 6 months.... 4 years ago. There are other factors, but to be honest, I don't think I'd be able to keep one down even if I had all the tools to do so. Anyone have any advice or wise words for me? I feel like I'm getting better in nearly every other way since being medicated, but this is still something I struggle with and feel really bad about. 

Like... Do I need to get over it? Am I just lazy? Am I ever going to be valued in this society? Will it get better once there's no other obstacles? Would it improve if I worked a job involving a passion, or would it steer me away from enjoying it independently?

"Ive been recently diagnosed with adhd and gad and i am currently on my third day of taking an snri. I suspect that I do indeed have bipolar disorder and my doctor confirmed that what I went through in the summer of 2020 was sebere depression following mania. Currently I feel an elivated mood, I have a loss of appetite and decreased need for sleep, today I slept st 3 am and woke up at 5 and I have a small sense that I want to do something impulsive like spending, sex, drugs or start fights. Is this something to be worried about? Should I contact my doctor? I havent been formally diagnosed but as my doctor said its bery hard to disgnose bipolar in teens, and my adhd and gad diagnosis makes it even harder because the conditions have similar traits. I'm scared of the anti depressants spiriling me into a horrible cycle like the one I had back then.

So are these warning signs of mania? Or am I overreacting and being a bit paranoid?",bipolar_disorder

"So I got invited to stay at a resort as a part of a marketing promotion for a resort. Free two nights, and all I had to do was sit through a sales pitch about vacation ownership shares. Went in thinking I wasnâ€™t going to buy one, but the sales guy was really cool and actually was upfront about everything. They gave me a great deal and the property only costs about 10k, I had to put down a $1400 deposit down on it (I had 11k in my savings no biggie Iâ€™ll have the money back in two months) I am medicated, no worries and my meds work great! I did miss my medication the night before buying this but I actually did have second thoughts while doing the paperwork, the salesman told me Iâ€™m not obligated to join anything he doesnâ€™t want me to do anything I donâ€™t feel comfortable with. I decided to do it. This is my first real estate purchase, so I have an investment, plus I can now take a vacation anywhere in the world for only $259 a week instead of paying over a thousand for a hotel room, the property trading company pays for my hotels. They also give you 20% discounts on flights, restaurants, stores and even rentals. Yes, there is maintenance fees. Itâ€™s only $465 a year right now and it only goes up a few pennies a year at this company. Worse case scenario I can always just sell if it doesnâ€™t work out. I think I made a good decision and I will get to see the world now like Iâ€™ve always dreamed to. I wouldnâ€™t have done this is if it was a crazy amount, my original offer was a $4k deposit on a $28,000 property and I said, Iâ€™m interested but Iâ€™m not financially comfortable with that much and they totally understood! I remember at the table freaking out like â€œoh god is this just another manic impulse buyâ€ but I think I actually just did an adult thing today and bought some property. I already have great credit but Iâ€™m worried the fact Iâ€™ve fallen behind on my therapy bills has caused my credit to drop. The company told me once I start making mortgage payments I can call them every three months to report to the credit bureaus and it will boost my credit! The salesman started in construction and owns property with the company and he said his credit has gone up hundreds since his investment started. Another upside is that I can also rent out vacations to other people for side income. Say I ask someone to give me a couple hundred to a few grand depending on what their trip would cost, and then I book them a trip through my company. Sorry for the long rant but I just wanted to share my story with people who understand what itâ€™s like to question investments. Normally when Iâ€™m manic Iâ€™ll buy dumb pointless shit like sports cars, and subwoofers, but this time doesnâ€™t feel like mania.

"About two years back I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but since Iâ€™ve become independent from my parents and moved out, Iâ€™ve stopped taking meds and kinda forgot about it till I started to reflect on my lifestyle n why I seemed to swing back and forth between a wired party/show goer who sleeps every other night for a week to going back to my normal empty feeling self. 

Long story short I think I have Cyclothymia (shorter phases with less intense lows). It seems really similar but not as severe as full blown manic and depressive episodes. 

Anyway I was thinking. Doctors these days are kinda just salesman for pharmacies and given that Google says bipolar disorder is â€œvery commonâ€ with over 3 mil cases per year, it begs the question of how accurate diagnoses are. I would expect the diagnoses with less severe symptoms to be more common no?

\- Memory very impacted. I keep losing my car keys as an example. I have often bended down to pick up a bag and forgotten I had my car keys in my hand and dropped them in the bag when I pick it up.

\- Sometimes when I speak I use incorrect grammar and only realize after I have said it e.g. 'she think that' instead of 'she thinks \[s added\] that'.

"My first diagnosis is bipolar 2

My previous meds (lithium zeldox) did not work so my doc changed another meds, carbamazepine.

At first week of carbamazepine, I experienced extreme sleepiness, extreme dizziness, trouble walking on flat ground

At second week of carbamazepine, I experienced too much dizzness, and visual hallucination. When I went outta home, I saw things that do not exist for like 2-3 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

I got very very paranoid and scared. I could not get out of my room and I googled sideffect like literally  every hour.

So, I searched several websites: 

first, my country's fda website 

second, med manufacturer pamphlet 

third, emc website

fourth, fda website

These four sources said that hallucination and dizzinesss are rare sideffects.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite of reading them, I was still very nervous and paranoid and scared. So I called my hospital.

Doc said ""just completely cut off carbamazepine and we will see you three weeks after."" 

So I followed exactly what my doc told me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Starting evening of November 3, I just completely stopped this med. Pharmacist said it takes 4 - 6 days for the meds to completely get outta my body. I have been waiting everyday. 

November 3 I experienced visual halluicnation. And the same goes for November 4 and 5 were the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Worried I might hallucinate again, I did not leave  my house at all today. I have been thinking all day whether my diagnosis will change to schizoaffective  / schizophrenia.  

I am still in confusion and the only thing I rely on at the moment is my doc's appointment three weeks later.

"Hey Bipo-Folk.

I'm not sure if this is exactly the right place, but I kinda would like some input from people who also have one or the other diagnosis. To see if you've been in this situation before....and some insight into whether or not I'm just being too sensitive. I have PTSD (due to three major events....but especially one of those - the worst one - would no doubt be a bit too triggering to write out), Bipolar Disorder and ADHD. 

So I recently fell out with a close friend of mine. We first were talking about it via WhatsApp. But eventually, we met up to talk about it in person. This was a week ago and I'm still rather hung up on something she said. 

The issue was that I have difficulty with relationship constancy and as a result, I am often unsure of the relationship between myself and others. I am also hypervigilant when it comes to changes in communication. For example, changes in tone or posture. And that's exactly what she used against me. She said I couldn't notice such things and that I had already said that I sometimes react somewhat paranoid. The issue of paranoia was something I was told last year during a hospital stay. However, I now know that it is not paranoia, but hypervigilance. She didn't (or couldn't) understand that.

The fact that she had even brought the subject of paranoia into the conversation feels to me like she is not only using things I have told her in confidence against me but also my diagnoses and difficulties. 

So....question...am I being paranoid or is that crossing a line. To me, it feels like she crossed a line. But I don't want to go and further fuel the conflict without proper cause.

"Not looking for a diagnosis but explaining what might be the biggest revelation that I just made about my latest falter. 

Note: I also have a history of substance abuse; specifically a three week binge in college I was introduced to Xanax by my roommate and I started popped them like candy. Did Xanax and frequently drank alcohol while on it. During this time had an intervention from my close friends and family where I was able to stop cold Turkey. Graduated college and have been working as a professional for the last 10 years. 

However since that episode Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with GAD and social anxiety and ADD. I currently see a medical provider who oversees my treatment. About 2-3 weeks before this vacation we decide to change my SSRI medication to Vilazodone with a dose increase a week prior to leaving. 


Anyways I met a guy down there off of tinder  who happened to have some Xanax and we went out together that night and offered me some. I said fuck it (which is so stupid to think about it cause we were out already drinking). I remember bits and pieces of literally the entire trip. I was popping Xanax like candy and drinking all day everyday. I usually have no sex drive because of my antidepressant but I think with the recent switch and dose increase of starting a new one; plus all of the damn substances I was on (several different drugs and was drinking constantly). I ended up having an insane amount of sex with multiple different guys who I met through dating apps and/or just while going out to the local bars which were all walking distance from my Airbnb. Now Iâ€™m literally the opposite of this as Iâ€™m very shy and reserved and usually am not one to be so careless but the benzos/alcoho combo is Literally the WORST and Iâ€™m sure everybody could tell I was fucked up. 

Anyways, I overspent money (thankfully I had budget for this trip in the event that emergencies happened so Iâ€™m okay there) had lots of random sex, did a lot of fucking drugs and drank like crazy and posted a lot of embarrassing shit. I missed my flight home, my wallet ended up getting stolen, lost my Apple watch, my AirPods, and my new $200 sunglasses I just bought for this trip. I stopped the drugs once I realized I was legitimately in a dangerous situation walking around Mexico without a fucking clue of where I was going. I got rid of whatever stash or shit I had on me and spent the night in the airport and booked the next flight home. Im embarrassed as fuck and disappointed and worried a lot of people  who constantly tried to FaceTime me and call me to make sure I was at least alive. 


Since being back im now just wondering if this all stemmed from a drug relapse addiction/substance abuse problem where  I was literally out of my fucking mindâ€¦. Or if that SSRI that I had just started and increased the dosage somehow was the catalyst to an episode of mania??? 

TLDR: Not diagnosed with bipolar or even with a hx of depression but I newly switched SSRIs which I take for anxiety. Also have a Hx of substance abuse/addiction. Went on vacation and was offered Xanax. Ended up on a 10 day bender of constant drug use, drinking, sex, I even got invited to sex parties and did more drugs, overspent money which isnâ€™t really new for me, missed my flight home and scared a lot of good people. I donâ€™t really remember much because of the drug combo and I do not know if I just relapsed from my addiction or if this is considered a manic episode. Again not looking for a diagnosis I am already seeing a mental health professional about this this week, but man what the fuck did I just do?!

"I forgot I had Reddit as a tool to get feedback until now and Iâ€™ve been stuck with a question I canâ€™t answer myself. 
So first off, I have the BPD/bipolar womb combo and am almost certain Iâ€™m manic and get irresponsibly stoned most of my day. A little under a year ago I had a whole horrific bpd break up horror show. I tried to kms what ever I failed on purpose and after I did that I realized that I really am not going to do anything and I canâ€™t just live like this all the time so I started taking time to properly work through the thoughts instead of just shoving them away and it all evolved from there. Around this time I started smoking weed as well. Once I moved out of my exâ€™s I gained a hobby of just staring at my walls constantly doing work inside of myself with an open mind. I still spend time on stuff I enjoy but when a thought comes up I take the time of day to think through it. I started learning about psychology Meditation and philosophy (during a manic hyper focus) and Iâ€™ve taken it all in. Iâ€™ve worked through various traumas making peace with my past bringing back repressed memories Iâ€™ve become so much more aware of splitting and catching bpd thoughts out of the â€œrealâ€ ones. Iâ€™m friends with my ex now believe it or not and even though my bpd is still very much attached to him it just feels like a test of strength to me so I can endure less later on. Each time Iâ€™ve had a depressive episode I use it as a time to learn more about my thought patterns and same with mania. These thoughts have the manic glimmer but Iâ€™m not sure if I just canâ€™t recognize hope. The other side to it is I spent a lot of time thinking instead of doing things that I should be spending my renewed life on but also Iâ€™m doing the work rn so I can enjoy life later since Iâ€™m like not cured just because I know a lot. If I say itâ€™s mania then that stuff wouldnâ€™t be true and Iâ€™m just lying to myself but if I canâ€™t say itâ€™s not because thatâ€™s what a manic person would say.

You want to sit and eat crepes all day and sip wine and wonder what it would be like to climb the Eifel Tower. It is your mission now, to move away. To become someone else.....anyone else. Time slows down to a screeching halt. The conversation ends and you feel empty. Everything is quiet. You listen to the trees blow in the wind. They are speaking in soft tones. The house is cold.

I want to say it gets better from here but it doesn't. Somehow the bottle of vodka has made its way next to you, but you don't quite remember grabbing it out of your ""Last resort"" cabinet. How many sips have you had....? Three? Five? It doesn't matter. Just keep going. Keep going until the noise stops. Until everything is quiet. You just want to stop thinking about everything, even things that don't seem relevant to what is going on around you, like why the laptop makes that weird loud humming sound, and why your face turns bright red when you drink, and what was I going to have for dinner tonight? The world turns hazy, like those cheap fog machines that people use on Halloween. Things multiply and your lips have started tingling. There's nothing left to do now except to curl into a ball in the bed and force your eyes shut tight, and pray that tomorrow this will all have been but a dream.",bipolar_disorder
"I've never been diagnosed with ADHD, but prior to my diagnosis, I had every symptom for it under the sun. My bipolar medication alleviates every single one of those symptoms. I feel like a different person. When I was first told I had to take medication every day, I was in terror. I could never remember to take something, even antibiotics. But once I'm on meds, I can stay on them. I haven't missed a single dose. Do you remember to take yours?",bipolar_disorder
"(F, 25, BPII) I always wonder if Iâ€™m on ~too~ many medications and thatâ€™s why I still donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m stable. I take Atenolol, Lexapro, Lamictal, and Rexulti every day, and Ativan as needed (and has been needed more frequently as of late).

I also really donâ€™t think I know what good and stable should be for me. My baseline is typically always â€œmehâ€ butâ€¦ that doesnâ€™t sound like a mentally healthy baseline to me. 

Iâ€™m a licensed mental health professional in a school building working with elementary kids. Itâ€™s tanking my mental health, but these needy friends are crying for help and this is my life passion. Quitting my job is not an option, and something my psychologist says we will continue to discuss over and over because they know I am incredibly stubborn. 

Iâ€™m working very closely with my psych and medication provider (who also work closely together in the same office). Theyâ€™ve mentioned Ketamine treatments if we all feel itâ€™s getting resistant, but canâ€™t help but wonder if Iâ€™m correct and all the meds are making me stunt progress. Either that, or Iâ€™m about to dip down and spiral with my moods because Iâ€™m starting to think Iâ€™m going to â€œfind myselfâ€ by reasoning my way out of meds. 

I donâ€™t really have a question but would love to hear from anyone reading this, and maybe just reassurance in which direction my foggy mind is trying to take me against my will.",bipolar_disorder
"Iâ€™ve been on lithium for 2 years now. Iâ€™m currently taking 1200mg at night. It has worked wonders and really helped with my mania. I have the typical side effects, dry mouth, mild tremor, and thirst. The only issue I have with it is the chronic diarrhea! Ever since my dose was increase last year I canâ€™t get through a meal, work day or anything without running for the bathroom multiple times. I also wake up several times a night with diarrhea. I thought something was wrong with my gut and spent a lot of time seeing my PCP this past year until recently when my psychiatrist disclosed she thinks itâ€™s from the lithium. She was aware of my diarrhea btw. Additionally my uric acid has been elevated since the dose increase. Iâ€™m pretty sure the lithium increase has something to do with it. Has anyone had any experiences with elevated uric acid? 
Why am I thinking of adding lamictal one so I can reduce my lithium dose and 2 so Iâ€™m not Tim Burton character depressed. My depression has not improve and Iâ€™m tired of feeling like I filled flesh sack. Also when I was on this medication it was a god send for my depression but not my mania
Would you recommend this combo? How was your depression and mania? Have you notice less diarrhea being on a lower lithium dose. Have a lower lithium dose affected you mania?",bipolar_disorder
"Recently met a fellow bipole over the internet (not here). We instantly clicked in a way I never have with another person. Our senses of humor lined up perfectly and the banter was just fantastic. We came to find out we were also very sexually compatible, as well, which was just the icing on the cake. I knew it was the codependency talking, but I'd finally found ""my person"".

Last night, she told me she'd been having to stop herself from saying she loved me for a while. I hadn't thought it was that way for her, but apparently the feelings were quite mutual. Last night, we decided to become an item, officially, and set down some ground rules. I was very happy. It just felt right.

Then she didn't really talk to me much today. She usually talks to me a lot during the day, but I assumed she was busy and gave her space. Then, a few hours ago, she texted and said someone had made an Instagram account using pictures of her and she was scared and I did my best to comfort her. About an hour ago, I went to check our messages, and all of hers were deleted and I was blocked.

I'm not sure if she suspected I had done it or if it was a story and she just got cold feet. Maybe she'd been manic and came to and realized she wasn't so interested and couldn't think of a way to let me down gently. I don't know, but I'm honestly crushed. Sometimes it really feels like there's a supernatural force conspiring to keep me unhappy.

I don't know why I'm sharing this, but I feel so fucked up and just needed to let this out.",bipolar_disorder

(tbf i think i feel less sleepy and more like i wanna void life as a big reason as to why i sleep) and then iâ€™ll go back to either mania or hypo mania

"Im just at a loss because I want to support her, but I donâ€™t know how to build our relationship up to a place where we can. I went through some things, and was eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders. Iâ€™m obviously not perfect but I can manage myself a lot better now. We are ok good terms, hang out regularly, etc. but I am not close with her, and I donâ€™t think sheâ€™s close with anyone enough to the point where she would open up. 

In May 2020, my dad left my mom. Over the past two years, I came to realize  heâ€™s not a great role model. Heâ€™s one of those guys who has a troubled childhood life and I think something bad happened to him. Itâ€™s obvious he loves my siblings and I, but he definitely has some sociopathic tendencies (in one example, heâ€™s idea of a relationship with us is very surface level. He just buys us things.). Heâ€™s not dangerous or anything, but heâ€™s made it clear that ultimately heâ€™s out for himself. My mom is sort a happy-go-lucky type who, although is the sweetest woman youâ€™ll ever meet, is very childlike and I canâ€™t rely on her to be a proper parent either sadly. 

I took him leaving my mom pretty hard even though I was 21 at the time and had a few manic outbursts.  My youngest sister took it hard too. She was 12 the time he left (and I donâ€™t think sheâ€™s had mania yet but I still really sense she may have the disorder). Heâ€™s never made an effort to be properly present in her life (though I argue with him to no end on how we have different definitions on how a parent should be there for their children). It was a drastic change in her style right away. She was very girly, very attentive to animals, loved Disney, princesses, etc before. A typical girly-girl, a little spoiled, but had a great heart. She started getting into that more dark style. Her hair first went to a cool Joan Jett cut, but she now has a more 80s menâ€™s heartthrob style and wears a lot of menâ€™s clothing. She looks insanely cool, and does it well, but itâ€™s pretty obvious itâ€™s stems from depression. I donâ€™t think sheâ€™s a different gender or identifies a different way too (sheâ€™s been asked and has said thatâ€™s not the case). If anything, I think sheâ€™s hiding from her â€œfemininityâ€ because of what my dad did. I could be wrong but I even asked my psychologist this once and he said that is a possibility. Obviously I would support her in anything. The fact this change came about during a traumatic situation and very suddenly with no signs before is why I am cautious though. I can guarantee I wouldâ€™ve donâ€™t the same thing if I was her age when my dad left. Her and I are super alike, even in looks. People think sheâ€™s my twin sometimes!

I found out she cuts herself. I also notice she looks at dark things on the internet. I did the same thing at her age, but my difference was I was very vocal about wanting help. She hasnâ€™t opened up and has not been receptive to anyones  attempts to help or support her. I was suicidal and sadly attempted quite a few times. Again though, I as vocal and always got help. She scares me. Sheâ€™d be the type to just do something without a word beforehand.  I think she may have bipolar too.  She has the same night terrors I started to have at the same time. I know for myself my mania didnâ€™t present itself until I started abusing my prescription drugs. Sheâ€™s currently not on anything. Obviously I canâ€™t diagnose anyone, but Iâ€™m really worried. Sure I have suffered, but I donâ€™t want that for anyone else, especially my sweet sister. 

What can I do to help? My bf is going to take her to the gym since heâ€™s super into lifting and he can give her routines, and thatâ€™s something sheâ€™s expressed interest in. We all want to get her to a counsellor but sheâ€™s not in that spot right now. Obviously you canâ€™t push someone. Iâ€™ve always been the one needing support, but now I want to step up and carry it forward. What can I do?",bipolar_disorder

"Been this way as long as I can remember. I never knew it was bipolar but eventually got diagnosed. I find it almost impossible to maintain friendships. I struggle to stay working but my wife and daughter need me to. I exist in a waling nightmare out of need to support others when I, myself, desprately what to die. I am trapped.

I work around people and some days Im fine. Ive actually been told Im really witty and funny when Im normal. Often Im depressed and I know everything coming out of my mouth sounds negative but it feels impossible to sound positive.

Then other days I am just either anxious out of my mind, hypomanic or flat. When flat I cannot think of anything funny to say to save my life so just end up responding with logical, rational things that have no real substance but always without a hint of humor. 

The people Im around eventually think Im dismissing them when they make jokes to get me talking and I can not respond in turn. What's worse is on my normal or manic days I have a never ending stream of jokes if I want them so when the depression happens they really think Im just dismissing them. Lol...it seems ironic to me in a morbid way.


 And...yep there goes another friend. And when the depression hits it's hard to talk, hard to think even to the point of slurring my words. Sometimes I cant hear what people are saying even when they are talking right in front of me. I know they are talking but it just sounds like gibberish or muffled. 


The sad thing is Im actually pretty smart. Sorry if that sounds arrogant. I only mention it because I know without a doubt if I didnt have this my life would be so different. No money troubles, friends and just a good life. But the longer I go on the more I realize that's never going to happen. 

I wrote this because Ive never actually felt like I could talk this way with anyone. Ever.

I'm a man drowning with a fake smile on my face so I dont have to hear questions like ""what is wrong"" all the time. To which there is no answer that would ever suffice.

My life has truly changed for the better since Iâ€™ve started medications and Iâ€™m very proud of my personal progress. I donâ€™t plan of ever stopping my meds!

So itâ€™s been about 6 months of dealing with my bipolar diagnosis, and Iâ€™m struggling big time to work through the depression.

It makes me emotional (lol) to look back on myself when I was a little younger, at the start of my 5 year relationship and how happy I was. I feel like at this point I owe it to myself and my very loving and kind partner, whoâ€™s stuck with me through EVERYTHING Iâ€™ve put him through, to be better. 

Iâ€™m starting by not smoking weed anymore - it was a daily before bed habit for me and thatâ€™s step one. My next step is to have a solid, same-time-every-night bed time. What else can I do? I know this is something I live with now, but Iâ€™m so tired of wallowing in my depression. Itâ€™s so hard to get out of and so easy to sit in. I have accepted that depression will be apart of my life as itâ€™s one portion of my mental illness, but the crankiness and bad feelings hanging over my head for days is getting old.

"So I (22m) have been struggling with BPD for two years now (probably longer but thatâ€™s when I was diagnosed). Iâ€™ve been put into a psych ward twice and had severe episodes that have ruined relationships with friends and romantic partners. I became incredibly addicted to alcohol and weed and would often use it as a coping mechanism. 

Long story short, I kept going from medication to medication and from therapy to therapy. They would change my meds, alter the dosage, but nothing seemed to ever be working. In fact, I would feel terrible on a lot of the meds they gave me. I didnâ€™t feel like myself. I felt as though I was trapped in some sort of weird dream state. I started losing enjoyment in a lot of things I liked to do and, worst of all, started losing my ambition. I became complacent in a lot of things. 

Eventually I had enough and stopped taking my medication for two months (a super dangerous and stupid move I know). I just wanted to feel normal again. I wanted to feel like my old self. It worked for a while too until I eventually had a terrible episode, ending with me sobbing in the closet of my workplace, unable to move. 

This was the point where I desperately started searching for solutions. I became paranoid though since my trust in pharmaceutical companies and medication had been tainted. Eventually, I came across an article talking about Lithium pills, a seemingly â€œall naturalâ€ mood stabilizer. After listening to a few podcasts and doing some more readings, I eventually took the plunge and requested lithium. Itâ€™s not a crazy high dosage and itâ€™s not 100% lithium, but itâ€™s the thing that I felt the most comfortable taking. 

So far, itâ€™s been an amazing experience. My mood has genuinely felt stable and I lot of the awful, spontaneous tantrums I would throw have been a thing of the past. I find myself thinking through scenarios a lot more and not just acting on impulse all the time. I feel a lot calmer and a lot more at peace. The best part is, I still feel like myself.

"Hi, I have had bipolar II since I was 14 (for 18 years) and have never taken any medication for it. I have no thoughts of harming myself or others and usually my symptoms are bearable with a good support network, healthy eating, exercise, and a history of good therapists. I am in my first trimester of pregnancy with my third child. 

I have been feeling panic and claustrophobia since I became pregnant and my doctor wants me to see a psychiatrist, but I am afraid of possible medication side effects (suicide thoughts, life threatening rash, loss of sex drive, weight gain, the list goes on and on), and Iâ€™m afraid that medicine will just make me worse in this unstable period that is pregnancy. 

Should I see a psychiatrist or should I cancel my appointment and continue without medication, since Iâ€™ve been pretty alright for 18 years without?",bipolar_disorder

"Hi everyone! I recently decided to lay off alcohol after a three month long period of binge drinking following the death of my grandmother. I'm in school full time, making straight A's, living alone with my dog and paying all of the bills myself. 
I took about 2 months off of work after my grandmother passed (she was almost like a mother) and I blew through my savings and put myself in a situation where I had to work a ton to be able to pay bills, on top of school, and drinking wouldn't allow me to accomplish those things. It wasn't hard to stop but what came after has been a challenge. 
I suspect I'm having an episode. While I have been able to keep up somewhat. My health is seriously suffering from how little sleep I've been getting. More specifically length of time I've gone with the small amounts of sleep that are accumulating. 
I am pushing myself because I had to. To have food, electricity, a house... Lol. 
So I've been making tons of plans to remodel (for cheap) etc and having major shopping urges which I don't usually go through with. Or I buy it and take it back. I'm usually pretty self aware and understand what I SHOULD do when times like this come on. However, my life didn't allow me to. 
The sheer lack of sleep, usually when I haven't slept all night, will cause me to sometimes see things but not like full hallucinations. Just looking at stuff and mistaking it for something else etc. 
As I'm typing I guess I'm realizing I probably am a bit manic. 
I'll just stop typing because I am going to talk in circles when the entire point of this question was to ask if anyon had stopped drinking and had it trigger and episode?

I'm attaching pictures from the day I stopped drinking so you guys can see. What do you guys think? Do you relate?

"Iâ€™m sorry if this reads as rushed, Iâ€™m kind of in a weird spot right now so I apologize. 

So I was only recently diagnosed with bipolar2 last summer during a hypomanic phase. I got on meds and was normal for maybe 3 weeks, then went into a depression. The most ever sever depression I have ever been in my entire existence, it even ended my relationship twice. That lasted for 7 months.

Finally at new year I got out of it and have been perfectly stable since! 

Except this past week, my anxiety is ramping because Iâ€™m afraid of when Iâ€™m going to be depressed again. My mood has always been very easily â€œtriggeredâ€, and I just heard a song that makes me extremely depressed. 

Sorry lol. My question is, how can I fight this?? I canâ€™t find a lot on the internet talking specifically about a bipolar episode. I am so scared right now and I donâ€™t ever want to be as depressed as I was ever again. Does anyone have any tips or personal experience? I just feel like I only have a small window to fight it before it blows up into a full severe episode.

"Hey everyone

I'm on aripiprazole and an anti-depressant. I also recently just came off Quetiapine. The other night I went out with some friends and had maybe 4-5 drinks over the space of 4-5 hours. 

The next day my friends said I was acting strange and doing some unusual things the previous evening when we were out; however I have very little or no recollection of some of the things they said I was doing and they sound quite unlike me. In fact, my memory of that whole evening is quite hazy and unclear. There's no way any of my drinks were spiked as I was vigilant and ensured they were with me the whole time. 

Is there any way that this could be a side effect or reaction from having alcohol with aripripazole? Has anyone else experienced memory distortions of this nature as a result of the interaction between alcohol and this drug?

He is a public figure who has a lot of sway over is fans on a larger scale than any past public figure. His attitude towards the media, his fans, and twitter involves so much more than whether or not he is taking medication.

Approaching the issue through the lens of analysis we are going to have on a sub regarding mental health has been EXTREMELY unproductive, from what I have seen.

"I have so many thoughts about this. Probably more invested than I should. And I can see from other posts that many people will agree with me but I have so many thoughts/feelings I need to share. Both as a therapist, and as someone living with bipolar.

I started showing symptoms as a teenager. I went from being a relatively â€œstableâ€ and â€œgoodâ€ kid to an irritable, hostile, aggressive, labile, manic, teenager. My mania often showed up as extreme grandiosity and due to the energy and lack of ability to do anything about it I became very irritable and just downright mean. Maybe a mixture of my age, stress, hormones, and my budding disorder. But thatâ€™s how I presented. And during my depressive episodes I became extremely apathetic. Hated God, the world, my mom, anyone close to me, myself. In those ups and downs I did and said a lot of â€œcrazyâ€ shit. I posted a ton on social media. As if it were my diary. I picked fights. I said cruel things. I felt like God. I felt like Satan. I felt like I had power and when others didnâ€™t see it boy did I get mad. And I reacted as such. 

Now, I am doing a lot better. A decade later. I have hindsight and insight and coping skills and am generally very stable.  and can see how erratic and toxic I was. I was (*am*) sick. And a lot of what I went through is characteristic Bipolar. Excuse? No. Symptom? Yes. 
And I was so alone and so scared and confused and sick. I had no idea what was happening to me and often lacked the insight to see I was alternating between those poles and acting erratically or in extremes. And I wish someone had shown me grace. And looking back at that person is hard. Itâ€™s hard for even me to show myself some grace. 

Kanye West has pretty severe Bipolar; we know heâ€™s been hospitalized and experienced psychosis. We know heâ€™s recently been diagnosed after being in the spotlight for decades with speculation. We know heâ€™s has a long-standing history of hardship and the trauma of losing his mother. In addition to this, there is the stress of being a celebrity. Of being in the spotlight 24 seven. In addition to this we know that he is often grandiose, and in real life he has access to quite literally unlimited money, power, and fans. This certainly cannot help his grandiosity and most certainly acts as a catalyst which makes it worse. On top of this we know he has recent stressors of the divorce and difficulty seeing his kids. These stressors are insurmountable for a â€œnormalâ€ person let alone somebody with a mental illness like bipolar. We know we have stressful things that trigger us, how can we expect these things to not trigger him. In addition to the stressor of his album coming out soon. Except heâ€™s under a spotlight. And he clearly lacks insight. We cannot be like everyone else and abandon someone with our disorder just because their symptoms right now are not pretty. We cannot give up on people with mental illness the second they show symptoms. We know that sometimes as a result of our symptoms we say and do things that are not true we are and we might look back and wish we had done things differently. Clearly heâ€™s having these moments as he deletes and re-post things and publicly apologizes only to fire off a few moments later. Heâ€™s sick. And just because that sickness isnâ€™t pretty right now doesnâ€™t mean we get to hate him.

I donâ€™t know about you guys but if I was in his shoes I could see how these behaviors would happen IF i were having a severe episode. Like I said- the reinforcer of his fans, the fame, the power, it definitely negatively influence his symptoms and make it worse. Heâ€™s feeling up and has the whole world at his hands. And heâ€™s unfortunately in the spotlight so everything that he does is judged. And 100% percent agree that a lot of what he does is not appropriate and itâ€™s not always good for others or himself. However, the way that people talk about him and our disorder is not OK. Bipolar people should allowed be allowed to be symptomatic without getting shit on and called horrible people and crazy. And the truth is sometimes some manic people do act like him when theyâ€™re manic. And thatâ€™s not fair that heâ€™s on a stadium constantly so heâ€™s being criticized. 

Look at how people are talking about him- thatâ€™s what they would think of all of us if they saw us at our worst moments. His just so happened to be broadcasted. Please look for yourself in him and see some grace for him whether or not youâ€™re able to find any similarities. Whether or not youâ€™ve ever had symptoms just like his and whether or not youâ€™ve ever made any great mistakes like this before which have hurt yourself or other people. I know if my worst moments were broadcasted that I wouldnâ€™t be too proud either, that doesnâ€™t mean we stop showing support for someone Who we know is struggling.

Yes we need to be accountable but we also need to consider the reality. And yes itâ€™s possible that part of this Hass to do with his personality and maybe we donâ€™t all like his personality or his music. But at the end of the day heâ€™s living with the same disorder that we are and we cannot tolerate the negative things being said about him nor can we buy into it that he is â€œcrazyâ€ or â€œbadâ€ because we know this is not his best day and we have seen better from him. We have seen times are very gentle and kind and giving man. We have seen a creative and talented man. We have seen a loving man. We are not our worst days and we are not our symptoms.

If you donâ€™t agree with me after this I understand and weâ€™re all entitled to our own opinions. But I feel very passionately about this. Maybe because I can see parts of my old self in his behavior, and Iâ€™m reacting so strongly because I remember how attacked I always felt. That being said, I just want people to take a moment to show some grace. Not only to him but to themselves as well. None of us are our worst days. None of us are our disorder. None of us are labels. We all deserve grace. And we donâ€™t deserve the things that people are saying about Kanye West or about our disorder.",bipolar_disorder

She believes they love each other, sheâ€™s getting an apartment near him, and they will be together after our divorce.

"Hello everyone! I am a 26 year old woman and I was diagnosed with bipolar two years ago. It makes sense. It immediately did and I got on lamictal. At first it was awful (for a month until the dose was right), then it was fantastic (for 6 months). After the 6 months it seemed to flatten me out almost entirely and wasnâ€™t too much help with depression. I wasnâ€™t falling to the depths of depression that I used to but I was never really happy. Despite doing my hobbies. Eventually I felt no drive to do literally anything. I couldnâ€™t truly feel happiness and I hated it. I wasnâ€™t myself. I wasnâ€™t social. I couldnâ€™t think properly and I was miserable. 

Sadly, my doctor moved and I couldnâ€™t get in with anyone any time soon because of the pandemic. This last September I decided to taper off my meds. It was a little wanky at first, but eventually I flattened out and felt alright. Until a month ago. 

The last month Iâ€™ve been battling depression pretty heavily. I had a week where I felt fine and then a little manic, but it was back to depression again. 

I am feeling really hopeless. I looked in to ketamine treatments because they have a wonderful success rate, but I canâ€™t afford them. I just donâ€™t want to get back in medication because it feels like it stole a year of my life from me. I donâ€™t feel like myself. I donâ€™t feel fun. Iâ€™m spacey. My memory is bad. But being this depressed is also bad. How do you stay positive? I am a very ambitious person but my disorder and the medication keep stealing my life from me. I feel like I will never get to where I want to go because of this terrible demon inside of me that will never let me go. 

I canâ€™t find a good therapist for bipolar. Iâ€™ve been through a few. Most arenâ€™t taking new patients. The wait to get to a good psychiatrist for medication is 3 MONTHS. 

I know I need to get back on but Iâ€™m just horrified. I want to be happy and successful and a good friend/partner but life is just so difficult. It feels incredibly cruel. I donâ€™t want to unalive myself or anything, but I am very sad right now. I just want literally anything to be easy outside of mania. I want even the most basic things to be easy but literally nothing is. People tell me it makes me strong but I donâ€™t wanna be strong anymore. Iâ€™m so tired.

"(This is a repost from my last with an edit.)

I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder in October during a severe manic episode so Iâ€™m curious to hear othersâ€™ stories.

Hereâ€™s my story.

My episode started in August. A guy with the same name as me messaged me (we were both gonna go to the same college). He asked me a bunch of weird questions thatâ€™d typically set off major red flags like â€œyou jerk off often?â€ I considered him bold. We agreed to become roommates/fuckbuddies. The moment I met him I realized I wasnâ€™t attracted to him. Oh well maybe we can be friends? Nope. One day he came into the room screaming at me because he was locked out the room and I didnt let him in (I was dead asleep). Luckily he sent me a threatening voicemail so I was able to switch roommates. Loved my new roommate so much. 

Moving forward, I started calling my parents at 3am almost every night rambling and screaming blaming them for traumatizing me even though theyâ€™re great parents. I went through my whole contact list calling people from my past I resent and told them all how I felt. I would interrupt my teachers and try to teach the classes myself. I smoke a lot of weed and started hitting dabs out of a big glass dab rig right in front of my school surrounded by people and would offer it to everyone that passed by (someone reported this, I was just trying to be nice ): ) I was suspended. While my mother (bless her heart) was packing my room up because I refused to, I was in the hall shirtless taping my dads business products to the wall and writing about how much I hate him in sharpie. The cops came because I was threatening to the roll the rest of my weed into joints and throw them all over the halls and break the vending machines. That night in the apartment I kept trying to figure out how to get prostitutes to come (to the apartment). 

Back home I became obsessed with trying to get a prostitute. I began talking to one who was probably just a dude from Nigeria. Said to bring $150 to some house. When my dad refused to give me the money I absolutely demolished my living room and kitchen, smashing picture frames and seasoning containers etc. My parents called the cops and I bolted out the house, turning to the prostitute for comfort, (s)he wasnâ€™t very comforting. When I started walking back a cop found me and escorted me back. They talked to me a bit very leaving. That night cops came back and took me to a psych ward. In there I became convinced I was gonna be a porn star, musician, photographer, painter, youtuber, twitch streamer all at the same time. I was so confident.

"5 years since my last hospitalization, Iâ€™m 4 years sober, and Iâ€™ve been the most stable ever in my life. I feel like Iâ€™m just taking my meds to keep it going, with the hope of one day being entirely off them. Not now, I have a newborn so not for a while. And my psych was totally for this and said he had success doing this with other patients.

Now Iâ€™m back to square one, and Iâ€™m really hoping I donâ€™t find a psych that wants to tweak things because Iâ€™m new. I just want to be on maintenance mode with this. Iâ€™ve reallllly taken control of my life in a lot of ways.

"Hey all, Iâ€™ll cut to the chase here I got a bp spectrum diagnosis a couple of months ago. Now I moved to a new state and got reassessed and got diagnosed w BPD and not bipolar. Anyway, I believe I have both for sure. Iâ€™m currently in an agitated depression state or mixed episode where anxiety is through the roof, canâ€™t really sleep, feel really restless and canâ€™t sit still etc. I donâ€™t have it rn be I have had paranoia here and there as well as derealization. I have been here 3.5 months and nothing seems to help.

Meds Iâ€™ve tried:
Effexor (37.5 mg) and abilify 2 mg ( these were my usual meds and they made me stable while I was on them but I was impulsive af) after this episode hit I tried to get back on them but they didnâ€™t work anymore which is weird cuz Iâ€™ve been on these meds on and off for like 9 years

Effexor 37.5mg and seroquel 75mg ( last time I tried this combo again it was a similar reaction to the abilify and Effexor where I felt good but also impulsive) this time it worked for a week then stopped working.

I tried seroquel on its own 100mg then 150mg but nothing, I felt slightly depressed and the episode was still there. 

Added lamictal to the seroquel and I felt better for a bit but then the episode came back 

Upped seroquel to 200 mg and had the lamictal at 100mg again felt better for a bit but then the episode returned

Now my new psych said to try vraylar 1.5 mg, and tbh I feel like shit. I feel what I think may be akathesia right after I take it, Iâ€™m taking it w lamictal too 


At this point idk what to do anymore Iâ€™m really worried â€¦ Iâ€™m not suicidal but I feel awful ðŸ˜ž

I'm learning it's ok to push people away to tell them to leave me alone, do they know how much they hurt me? I'm grocery shopping now, I look at people and wonder if they are ok too, if they're hiding it as much as I am, I look at people and wonder who is also bipolar.

I was diagnosed with bipolar about a year ago and Iâ€™ve never had a therapist. The good times feel good and feel like I can deal with my problems myself. Then the bad time feel really bad and I feel like Iâ€™m drowning. Iâ€™m sure everyone can relate lol. I kinda live in the middle of nowhere and the therapist I had for about a week (they had a medical problem and we couldnâ€™t continue) just wasnâ€™t really experienced enough in bipolar clients. I feel like Iâ€™d just have to do video calls with a therapist if I did decide to get one. Iâ€™m just a little hesitant because I know that can feel like itâ€™s not personal enough.

"Iâ€™m in a mixed episode waiting for my meds, I had to leave the pharmacy twice because I freaked out for the line being too long and slow. 

I have a dog that is very playful and my best friend. I AM NOT OKAY!!!!!!!! 

She is used to having so much attention and playtime outside. Everytime I go outside I get angry and freak the fuck out. I hate being in that state because itâ€™s physically painful and not fair to my dog and humiliates me in front of everyone. 

I wish soooo sooooo. SOOOOOOO.  Badly I could just hide in my room all day. But I canâ€™t. Cause she has to go out. And thereâ€™s soooooo many people outside. And she wants to play and talk to everyone, so I canâ€™t just take her out â€œreally quick.â€ I HAVE to give her these long three walks everyday at ventral park and Iâ€™m sick of that fucking park. 

Iâ€™m so fucking pissed off right now I am OVERRRRR THE FUCKING EDGE!!!!! She keeps randomly barking and then I scream and get even more angry. It ruins my entire state to be able to go outside. 

Then she paces and moves around and irritated the ducking shit out of me!!!!! I need to be alone. I need to be alone. This is too much overload. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I want to block out that I even have a dog I donâ€™t wanna think about it- I NEED TO RELAX!!!!!!!!! 

I sit down? She paces and stares to go outside. Iâ€™m not allowed to sit. If I lay her she will start pacing. If she sits next to me she just opens her belly for me to rub, but then my hands are too fast for her liking and Iâ€™m not calm enough to pet her but then I feel pressure and guilt that Iâ€™m this horrible fucking person when Iâ€™m just really really sick right now with no help:(

Iâ€™m so mad right now and really donâ€™t wanna go out there :( I hate myself for this shit and this is never ending. I have to do it again tomorrow. And the next day. I really donâ€™t wanna go out there if Iâ€™m like this now omg imagine when we are out there. 

I mentioned my dog is my friend so I canâ€™t just go outside and wear headphones and throw a ball. She needs my interaction. If I donâ€™t look at her and focus on my phone, she wonâ€™t get the ball or anything. If I try to walk with headphones and zone out, she will drift behind me so I yell for her to keep up. When usually, Iâ€™d be talking to her the whole time and interacting and like playmates. 

I am not ok and no no one is here to help because everyone who wants to help me wants something from me and wants to see me and hangout with me and then Iâ€™ll be trapped with them when the whole reason I need to be alone is to get away from ALLLLLLL this!!!!!!

I know everyone will say give away my dog. Iâ€™m ranting and sooooo pissed and uncomfortable. I love my dog and she is so well cared for. Iâ€™m just really sick right now and aware itâ€™s not her fault. I donâ€™t take it out on her but feel bad because I know she is worried that Iâ€™m not myself. I just wish I didnâ€™t have this feeling in my body and I wish no one would bother me outside. I wish I could go from A TO B on a walk very quick without my dog leading me around all diff directions to stay longer.",bipolar_disorder
"I need some advice. Iâ€™ve been with my wife for going on 8 years now, and weâ€™re finding out a lot of our problems are stemming from her undiagnosed bipolar disorder. I used to think I was just a real piece of shit, but turns out her lows are a real piece of shit (not her). Iâ€™ve learned to recognize when sheâ€™s going down to the dark place, and letting her know when she stops acting like herself. Itâ€™s interesting because she doesnâ€™t even realizes sheâ€™s doing it until I say something. 

The question I have for yâ€™all is, how can I help her when sheâ€™s in an episode? Anger at the smallest things, lashing out, etc. Iâ€™m a fixer, unfortunately, and I want her to feel better, but it seems space is what gets her out of it the best. I donâ€™t know. I want her to feel comfortable all the time, and loved, but she has such a hatred for her depression and bipolar issues that she feels like she needs to take care of it by herself. Nobody else should worry about them but her. Right now sheâ€™s aggressively deep cleaning the kitchen, and I am keeping my distance in the game room. Now she into the guest room and cleaningâ€¦ 

How can I help her??? Iâ€™m not perfect, I have severe social anxiety and ADD that Iâ€™m medicated for, so when sheâ€™s manic and we sync up we can rule the world together, but how can I help right nowâ€¦",bipolar_disorder

Husband said a few things that made me upset. They weren't even super mean. Just hurt because they were true. So I've been nonstop cleaning. Then I bawled my eyes out for 10 minutes. After that I popped right back up, feeling great and ready to clean, bright eyed and super happy.

My concern is that this kind of emotional event is going to throw me right back into a depressive episode but I'm worried i wont be able to tell how much of it is still needing more meds or just going through the break-up process. Obviously I can't just keep pumping the meds to feel numb but on the other hand it may need to occur in general since i was still having minor anxiety episodes and minor feelings of impulsive ness.

"Even writing this is difficult.  
I was first diagnosed in my third year of undergrad with bipolar with psychotic features after rapid cycling. I did graduate with the degrees that I wanted, and after finally adjusting my medication (lithium and cilexa), things seemed good.  
Then things got bad again, for seemingly no reason. I remember being horribly depressed around Christmas, then things just improved again.   
Now I'm in graduate school, and when I started, I felt wonderful. I was making friends, my research was exciting, and I felt like I found a great place where I belonged.  
But all that has changed.  
Now I spend my days in a haze. I don't feel the drive that I had a few months ago. It saddens me, since I work with some incredible people.   
I've been rapid cycling through life so much that it all doesn't feel real anymore.  
I guess I'm just wondering if others here feel the same.  
Luckily I have a very supporting family, and a wonderful psychiatrist, and a wonderful PI who understands my condition, and has helped in some very important ways.

"For a month now my face by my nose and chin has been red. I've been getting some bumps on my jaw line and neck that have scarred and smaller bumps started to appear on my chin. I've never had acne except for a zit here and there. Nor have I had dry skin this this. So, I started to wonder if it may be a reaction to my Lamictal. 

It is important to note that I live in the very cold and dry Wisconsin winter. Also my anxiety with medical issues has been an issue with catastrophizing/Google doom scrolling. 

I went to the walk-in two days ago (Friday) and at first the doctor said no worries, here's a steroid cream it'll be gone in a week. She left and came back in the room and said on second thought, let's get your liver enzymes and cardiac enzymes because my heart rate was 119 and she wanted to check for lupus. I always have a fast heart rate. Especially at doctors due to anxiety and it comes down after being there a bit. I do need to exercise more. I'm a work in progress. 

Part of that progress has been quitting alcohol. I heavily drank the last 8 years (I'm 28). Today, I'm 23 days sober and very confident I'm never going back.

The doctor said they'd call me with my labs by the end of the day Friday and it is now Sunday. My anxiety is on overdrive. I didn't have it in me to call Saturday because, anxiety.

I'm convinced this isn't a Lamictal rash as it has since cleared up, just my luck. 

My brain won't stop ruminating on the possible liver damage I've done over the years of heavy drinking. 

I just stopped drinking, I've been the best and the most stable I've been in a long time mentally. I just don't want to hear that news. My kid needs me, you know?

Should I worry they haven't called with labs? I have no symptoms of liver damage other than fatigue but I mean... not any more than normal.

If anyone out there can just encourage me with stories or advise on not catastroohizing to get me through until I can call tomorrow, I'd appreciate it. Right now I can't stop thinking about the worst case scenarios.

tl;dr : went to the walk-in for possible rash on my face. Now I'm catastrophizing about my labs showing liver damage from years of heavy drinking (23 days sober). Just would like some encouraging words.",bipolar_disorder

My psychiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar II, I think mainly based on my depressive episodes which last a couple of weeks (though since he put me on Lamictal they're definitely not as bad as they used to be and I actually can function during them, it's mostly an anhedonic feeling now, and I don't feel as helpless as I used to). I'm also seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis, who doesn't think it's bipolar, more like traits of bpd, based on the fact that she's never seen me be hypomanic, and i've always become depressed after periods of long stress. I'm not sure I've ever been hypomanic either.I'm mainly happy and positive about life. I am quite impulsive but I think within reason. I've never caused serious issues for myself or those around me, or got into trouble. Even though i consider myself an introvert and i need my time alone, when im not in a depressive episode i'm quite talkative and easily make friends. So my question is, how serious are your hypomanic episodes?",bipolar_disorder

"Hi everyone. A little background, I was diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder at the age of 15. I got fully blown manic for the first time then and it was severe. At the end of my mania I was psychotic and delusional. I got medicated, heavily, and for the next year and a half I gained about 75lbs. Life was very difficult for the first three years trying to accept the diagnosis I was given. I was smart enough to still retain good grades (mostly As, some Bs) even though I missed 60% of my high school career due to severe depression. 

Since then, I would become slightly hypomanic and then become depressed. Took me some time but by the age of 22 I was doing much better, was on different medications, and was stable. Then, I was put on new medications and gained an additional 40lbs. Fast forward to when I was 28. I decided to get off my medications to lose weight (which I did, I lost about 80lbs in four months due to becoming fully blown manic again). I was very unwell and was hospitalized several times until I was medicated again and gained all the weight back. 

I then found a new psychiatrist, changed medications once again, and I have lost 60lbs since May 2020. I have been stable since March 2019. I am healthier, got accepted to a PhD program, and am doing the best I have done in years in terms of both my physical and mental health. However, every day, I get this paralyzing fear that I will wake up so manic and I will have to take many step backwards. The thing about my Bipolar is that I have the worst form if I become manic. It's classic textbook but very self-destructive and borderline dangerous. I fear that I will become manic again. I take my medications religiously, every night, never miss a dose. I work out each week and have a personal trainer (got one a few weeks ago). I eat healthy and I don't have cheat days. I see my therapist once a month to check-in. I see my psychiatrist every few months. However, even though I have been so stable and I am doing so well, this fear is always in the back of my mind.

I feel as if I may be losing control even though there is nothing to back that up. I am painfully self-aware of my thoughts and behaviors and yet nothing indicates that I have a ny mood instabilities or imbalances. Thankfully, I haven't experienced any depression in the past few years but I have become more anxious (anxiety is new to me). Is this a warranted fear of mine, of me becoming manic suddenly, even though I am taking my medications and taking fare of myself? Has anyone else experienced this fear? Thanks in advance for any insight/help/advice. I try to rationalize this fear but the last time I was manic it was the worst time of my life and the fear doesn't seem to be going away.",bipolar_disorder

"The pharmacy ran out of my meds. Normally when I go without I feel extremely depressed, but this time I was hypomanic. I hadnâ€™t felt so good in ages. Even when I got my refill, I didnâ€™t take them because I didnâ€™t want to come down. But as well all know, mania doesnâ€™t last foreverâ€”and now my life is in the trash.

Depression hit me like a ton of bricks and Iâ€™ve been calling out of work frequently. Today was the icing on the cake. I texted my coworker last minute to let everyone know I wouldnâ€™t be in, but I didnâ€™t let my manager know. I was so ashamed of myself I couldnâ€™t hit the send button. She called me twice and I didnâ€™t pick up, and the day is over and I still havenâ€™t explained myself. I may get fired.

This is one of the best jobs Iâ€™ve ever had and I ruined it. Iâ€™ve spent all of today crying and hating myself. At my lowest I locked myself in the closet and contemplating ending it, and then I hated myself even more for being so low and making my fiancÃ© deal with me.

Iâ€™ve been extremely lucky with my meds. The first thing I tried worked, and I have no side effects. I feel completely normal when Iâ€™m on them. But apparently normal wasnâ€™t good enough for me, and Iâ€™m filled with regret for it. Iâ€™m normally not ashamed of being bipolar because itâ€™s managed well, but today? Iâ€™m so ashamed of the way I am. I feel like I always ruin good things, and I have no one but myself to blame.

Iâ€™ve (obviously) started my meds again, and while Iâ€™ve learned my lesson Iâ€™m worried it wonâ€™t be enough. It takes a couple days for them to kick in and I have to live with myself in the meantime. I donâ€™t want to look for a new job, but I might have to. I havenâ€™t felt this low in almost a year, and itâ€™s hard. I just want to crawl into a hole and never be seen or heard from again. I hate that Iâ€™ve made my own problem everybody elseâ€™s, too. I hate that I have this problem in the first place.",bipolar_disorder
"Not sure where this rant will end up but 
CW: Suicidal thoughts, thoughts of self harm, pessimism

First off, I appreciate you opening my post and taking some time to read my thoughts. 

I feel very alone. I have love and support but I canâ€™t put into words whatâ€™s wrong with me. For the past week or so Iâ€™ve been in a depressed episode. No motivation, no pleasure, bored 24/7, agitated sleep, decreased appetite, the whole 9 yards. But nothing is bringing me down. 

Usually I get triggered by something and then Iâ€™ll be upset for a few days or weeks, at least then I can try to notice a problem or stressor. But itâ€™s been about a week and I canâ€™t figure out whatâ€™s got me down. I guess itâ€™s not that important though. 

I stare at my walls for hours, lay with blankets covering everything but my eyes an nose. Tightening curtains to dampen the sunlight. Iâ€™m so bored and existentially frustrated. Iâ€™m at the point where Iâ€™m either completely checked out or Iâ€™m thinking about death or dying or hurting my hands. 

The worst part is everyone in my life is happy and willing to help. All I have to do is put together the words to try and explain how Iâ€™m feeling. But I canâ€™t. They need reasons, they do their best to understand but they just donâ€™t get that this illness beats us senseless sometimes without rhyme or reason. I guess thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m writing out a rant here instead of my messages app. 

I donâ€™t really know what Iâ€™m looking for from this post. I think I just want to be heard and maybe validated a little :/ :(.

Thank you for reading. I hope peace and happiness find you in your struggles.",bipolar_disorder
"Hello,

As I mentioned in a previous post, next month I will be trying adderall for extreme fatigue. I'm afraid it might trigger mania so I'm trying to come up with a plan so that if I start going manic psychotic again I'll be prepared. Last time I had a manic episode it crept up on me over time, so I'm hoping if it starts happening on the adderall I'll have time to catch it. 

Here's the things I have so far as a plan;

1. Research a psych ward in the area for emergency check in
2. Get emergency contact info for the doctor
3. Track moods daily (I use daylio) 
4. Check in with family daily sometimes in person
5. See therapist twice a week instead of once a week

Is there any other things I should try and do? Any advice is welcome. Last time I had a manic psychotic episode it took me 6 months to recover so I want to be proactive just in case. 

Thank you!",bipolar_disorder

"Hey everyone, could use some words of encouragement/direction. Long and complicated story(arenâ€™t they all). But in short I have dedicated 5+ years of my life to youth camping. It made a huge impact on me as a child, and as someone who came from a traumatic home, camp was a safe place for me that introduced me to young adults I really looked up too. I always have wanted to be able to foster that safe place and pass it on too the next generation. 

So because of this ambition I find myself at a very large summer camp working seasonally for 3 ish years(Covid was a mess). Itâ€™s a lot bigger and more professional than the camp I grew up going to and started working at, but Iâ€™ve always felt supported and I loved the fact that there were so many stable, high functioning adults around me. It offered me the ability to use my social chameleon skills I learned during trauma to just model their behaviors. 

It went well for a while, Iâ€™ve never had anything but positive feedback and I loved working with the kids and groups. Last summer I was depressed for a few reasons, including being passed up for a full time year round position, which would have given me so much more stability in life. I really tried not to let the depression affect my work but when you are working 60 hour+ weeks, people are going to notice. 

Iâ€™ve had a few panic attacks, and last night was the first time at camp I was what I consider, full manic. Honestly the best managed manic episode of my life(meds &amp; therapy have helped a lot). No suicidal ideation, not belligerent or anything of the sort. I just asked for a friend so I didnâ€™t have to go through it alone. Well that was enough for them. They told me today they donâ€™t feel they can support me the way I need. Sadly I agree. I have so many feelings Iâ€™m dealing with, still fighting of the manic episode which was made worse by this news.

I guess I had hoped that their support ran deeper than a puddle, but I canâ€™t change that. I guess my question is has anyone successfully found a career/community that could understand what Iâ€™ve been through, how far Iâ€™ve come, and that I still have ambitions that I donâ€™t want want bipolar to hold me back from.

Hello friends,
I bring good news...happy news meant to Share and Spread the message of Hope and the Love to those in need of it. What has happened seems like such a Rarity that I have to do all I must to keep the Ember from going out. The Fires it has the potential of lighting have the possibility of bringing Warmth and Dryness to many of those still stuck in the Storm.

The message is this....you can get better. Life can improve, and if you find enough willpower in yourself, it is not a matter of 'if' it happens, but 'when.'

I speak of this after coming out of a 2 month long Psychosis fueled Manic episode that lead straight to a Full Fledged year of the some of Darkest Depression I have ever experienced. This last depressive episode quite literally had me standing on the rails of my 2nd story balcony Pondering if that might be my way out.

Today, I sit here typing these words with tears of gratitude for appreciating how Undescribable the Relief feels. This last week has been a Reawaking of my Sense of Self to the world. I'm finally remembering who I am, what I was, who I want to be. Not only this, but my body finally seems to have mustered up the ability to start doing something about that. Change is happening, and all so quickly, so sudden, that my mind is blown away that the Backpack full of Boulders I've been carrying around is only 10ft behind me. And strangely enough, I don't feel the need to turn around and pick them back up.

No more is my Head Feeding me a Stream of Lies. The Insidious and Ominous Cacophony of Twisted, Base-less negative thoughts and anxieties miraculously has come to a silence. The Quiet has Come Back to allow my true self to start Singing Again.
And that I will do, because not everyone gets a second chance, or in my case...a 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th.

This has not come easy. Feelings like this most often times Do Not just Show up at your Door. And if they do, they are only brief guests as a go between. No, these feelings have come from Countless Hours of actually putting in effort, trying to improve. Long nights reading medical journals, researching medications and supplements, watching Ted Talks and Informational Videos online about not just Bipolar Disorder but the entirety of Mental Health as well as How To Beat It. And I have learned drinking lots of water, cutting out unhealthy food, actually eating properly, trying to maintain good sleep hygiene, streching and exercise...all of these things are hard, but they will Nourish your Mind and Body giving you an Adequate platform for your Soul to Launch off from, for how can you Flourish if you're always Sick and Tired? And help is out there. You can learn from anything and anyone, but you have to put Forth the Effort, bring the Willpower, Consciously be Taking Note. There are times when it may seem non-existent, but that Little Voice in the back of your head telling you Not to Give Up when the Weight of the World is crushing every square inch of your body is All it Takes. 

I did it, I beat the odds. The Amount of Struggle I have overcome seems insurmountable Looking Back...and this has given me a New Respect for my illness, for it will overtake me if I do not keep it Tamed and Docile. And I know this may and most likely will not last forever, for life always comes with its Challenges and Uncertainties, but for now when they come, I will be ready, and I will Stand my Ground and Fight.

"I (21 F) was diagnosed bipolar 3 years ago, and I always felt like I needed more structure and emotional support when my family and friends couldnâ€™t provide that for me. When I was manic two months ago I thought it would be a great idea to get an older-ish cat since I had the money and time to provide for him. Now, two months later, I am filled with regret and guilt for not being able to provide the emotional support he needs. When Iâ€™m manic I never want to be home and when Iâ€™m depressed my environment reflects it (dirty, sleeping, and easily agitated).

"Hey,

I haven't felt this low in about five years, a time in my life when I was in and out of the psych ward as a kid.

I'm twenty now, and feel inpatient is the best decision for me both treatment and safety-wise.

I'm really scared about losing my rights, about not having my phone, and about not being able to possibly pursue my preferred career (EMT, requires a state license to practice).

I'll be taking all of this up with my therapist tomorrow but I'm looking for personal perspectives from individuals in similar situations. 

As a kid, I found inpatient to be rather enjoyable - like a break from home. But, I also grew up in an abusive house riddled with drugs and maggots. 

My therapist has been wanting me to go inpatient or at least PHP for months now.

So: is anyone willing to share their experience going inpatient as an adult?",bipolar_disorder

"Hey, so, basically my psychiatrist sent the wrong meds to me. I take 150 mg of Seroquel (which is sent as two separate prescriptions), but my new psychiatrist accidentally sent me 150 mg tabs of Seroquel XR. I've only just realized this now, but it takes a long time to reach my psychiatrist (it's through Zoom and it seems like he's always booked far in advance) and idk if I'll have enough time to contact him before I run out of Seroquel.

My main question is: I know they aren't the same, but would it be, I guess, mostly okay for me to take the Seroquel XR instead until I get my meds fixed? If I stop taking Seroquel I withdraw BAD, and feel really sick. But I know they XR isn't the same, and I'm a bit on the fence if should take it. If I do end up taking it, what should I expect to happen in the short term?

And just to clarify, in case it wasn't clear, this is a temporary fix. I'll be switching back to standard Seroquel at some point during this whole ordeal.",bipolar_disorder

"Title

So, I've been all over the place with my friend groups and i leave them when I feel its better that I stop inflicting stress on myself. I done this when high school ended, got back in touch, and now stuck with this shit.

My current friend group i have had since high school and they lost interest in me. I try my hardest to keep in touch with them but they dont bother nor have the interest in me. Our relationships are very one sided, as in I am always the one who tries to stay in touch.

They constantly talk behind my back about things I do, and they share it with people i cut off for very good reasons. For example at our old DND sessions, they accused me of stealing from their house and blew off my cry for help with mental stress, but in a way that told me i was selfish. This is very funny cause I was the one who consoled them when they needed help, but i guess for me its a problem with them. Keep in mind these were people i trusted. And now I am alone with no one to care, but im starting to prefer it.

To be blunt as i can be, I cant tell if its me anymore. Im probably going to block everyone tonight and never return. Not like they give a fuck anyways. Im tired of the constant fake shit. Why do people go out of their way to lie and make things even worse. If you didn't give a fuck then you should've told me rather than continue to purposefully lie.

If there is literally a single person who thinks i should cut them out of my life, say no more cause ill fucking do that shit immediately. It doesn't even hurt anymore",bipolar_disorder

"Anna Akana is someone I look up to. I like how smart, articulate, and seemingly well-rounded she is and I often watch her vlogs to gain more insight into mental health. I caught up with her recent YT uploads yesterday and came across the **7 words/verbs of intimacy** as detailed by renowned Psychotherapist, Esther Perel, and I felt that it could be a good mental exercise to review all 7.

**7 Words or Verbs of Intimacy**

1. **Ask** \- How comfortable are you asking for your needs to be met?
2. **Take** \- Do you allow yourself to indulge and feel deserving?
3. **Receive** \- Can you acknowledge when someone wants to give you something? e.g. material items, emotional attention, affection, etc.
4. **Give** \- Would you call yourself stingy? Do you tend to over-give? Do you give to people just to please them? 
5. **Share** \- Is there a hesitation for you to share and open up? Does this threaten you or make you feel open and vulnerable?
6. **Refuse** \- Can you say no when you need to? Are you able to set proper boundaries?
7. **Play**  \- Do you feel safe enough to let your guard down and be your true self in front of other people?

This really seems like a reliable framework for anyone wanting to know more about themselves; not just people like me who are dealing with mental health diagnoses.",bipolar_disorder

"There is a TLDR at the bottom, I just wanted to give context before anyone asked. 

For context: I (26f) have been in a relationship with my partner (23f) for just over two years. She is diagnosed with Bipolar type I and has frequent hypomanic/manic episodes, (Iâ€™m talking like at least once a month with hospitalisation once a year). 

I am also diagnosed but with type II paired with ADHD, so needless to say we are a fiery couple with a myriad of issues, but no shortage of love for each other! 

The current situation: after about three months of trying to maintain her stability upon noticing the early signs of mania, we slipped up with the sleep for ONE night (Iâ€™m sure you can guess why) and things started to spiral from there. She became hypomanic and the meds werenâ€™t strong enough to hold her back. It took a turn for the worst when the sleep medication the doctor prescribed had the opposite effect and she became full blown manic. She then went on to drink and smoke behind my back (knowing I wouldâ€™ve urged her not to), and a few hours later we were in the ER to treat her psychosis. 

The dilemma: sheâ€™s been in the psych ward for a couple of weeks now. Sheâ€™s much better now and seems like her hypomanic self. She has, however, been getting far too close with another patient. She confided in me during our last visit, and claims that itâ€™s because sheâ€™s lonely, and I can imagine the hyper-sexuality doesnâ€™t help. The nurses can only do so much to keep them apart, but sheâ€™s still somehow managed to get close enough her to â€¦you knowâ€¦ 

Iâ€™m not jealous because Iâ€™m aware that theyâ€™re both in a vulnerable state and are probably just trying to keep each other company. I also really feel for my partner and how lonely she is, but for obvious reasons I donâ€™t want her getting involved with another patient like that. I told her it was inappropriate and to consider how I feel, then she asked if I could sneak in some of my worn underwear to sniff the next time I bring her clothes so that she wouldnâ€™t have to â€œfind it elsewhereâ€. 

My question is: is this an appropriate thing for me to do? Is it morally ok for me to fulfil this request for someone who is recovering from an episode in a psych ward? It made me uncomfortable at first but at the same time I am her partner and I donâ€™t want her to feel lonely. I wouldnâ€™t even think about this if she were still in psychosis or fully manic but thatâ€™s not the case now. In a vulnerable state, yes, but Iâ€™m not touching her inappropriately or even flirting back, itâ€™s more just that I want to give her everything I can to make her feel more at home in there. Would I be wrong to do this for her?

"For the last four years, I (21f) have dedicated almost all of my time to figuring myself out and becoming a better person. I'm bipolar so I still struggle with a lot of things, but my relationship with myself has improved immensely and I'm comfortable with where I'm at.

Earlier this year, I wanted to get back into dating since I had taken a two year long break. I dated a guy for about four months, and it was awful. We went on two dates before he asked me to be his girlfriend and he was 'in love' with me within two weeks. Coming out of it, I realized the biggest issue was that we rushed into being in a relationship and skipped over a lot of important conversations. It ended so badly that I've been wary of dating again, but I knew that if I let myself sulk over it I would never get over him so I joined a dating app.

I've met a lot of guys on there, a few that I've kind of liked, but nothing spectacular. About two months ago, I met a guy that I'll call John. He's nice, but nothing about him has really stood out to me. Lately, he's expressed frustration that we haven't gone on a date yet.

Now, if I had met John even three months earlier we would have already been in a relationship, practically living together and talking about what we'd name our kids within a few weeks. Then after a few months we'd have an explosive break up and never speak to each other again. All of my relationships since I was 13 have followed this pattern.

Now that I'm able to recognize that pattern, I've been trying to avoid it with John by taking things extremely slowly, which has only caused frustration for both of us. It's hard to maintain interest and we've argued about when we'll meet each other three times now. I really want to stop worrying about it and just see him, but I don't want to deal with another break up caused by pacing issues.

So, how do I balance becoming obsessed with someone within a week and spending months wondering if I'm ready to go on a date?",bipolar_disorder
"So Iâ€™m in a new area and my family is away for a while. I had plans with someone and I was really excited about it but he had to cancel today because he forgot about a work obligation. Completely reasonable and we are rescheduling for Thursday but I am still feeling so bad about myself. I feel like a loser having absolutely no plans today or tomorrow and Iâ€™m bad at being with myself. 

I feel myself feeling more depressed for being alone. I have no issue going to a cafÃ© by myself for lunch but Iâ€™ve never gone out alone for dinner. I thought about bringing a book and sitting at a bar at a casual restaurant, that way Iâ€™m not sitting at a table alone. Is that really weird? I had planned my outfit this morning and I had put it on because I felt good in it and it would also make me sad to not get to use it. 

Is this something you experience too? I canâ€™t help but get depressed or feel bad about myself if plans are cancelled and I feel too alone. Is going out to dinner alone weird? 

Iâ€™m really leaning towards just trying it so wish me luck I guess :)",bipolar_disorder

I am comfortable and trust my bipolar self to make a â€œjointâ€ decision to go and get help with out the embarrassing feeling that Iâ€™m going for help.

Making sense of our feelings and discovering who we are, the good and the bad, has been more helpful to me than any medication. Hope this helps someone.

Hi, Bipolar 1 here. In 2014 I was put on Zoloft (misdiagnosed for Major Depressive Disorder) when I was on Zoloft it was a complete nightmareâ€¦ Apparently, I was totally manic the entire time. My Dr switched me to Abilify immediately without even gently trying to ween me off of it, a few days later I was hospitalized. Spent 6 days inpatient and became stable.

"Five years ago, I was diagnosed with type one bipolar, and currently living alone here in Japan.

I do take my medication and get therapy to help me control my feeling and thought. 

It is kind of hard to explain my feeling or the illness, not just the language barrier (Iâ€™m fluent in Japanese) but also due to the cultural differences, I do find it hard to connect with other people here. (Iâ€™m from the Middle East)

the sad thing is if something ever happened to me here. There is no way for my family to get in contact with me. And will take them a day or two to come here to Tokyo.

At the same time, I do not want to return to my home country. I feel that all my sacrifices will go to waste if I ever go back home. The only path I see is moving forward.

I came to accept that fate. I donâ€™t see my illness as â€¦ curse but as something I need to take responsibility for. 

But I do envy people who do
find happiness and someone to share it with. 

I canâ€™t ask someone from my home country to come to live with me here. 

The culture shock and having to learn Japanese just to do the normal daily routine. And add to that my Illness. I donâ€™t feel it fair or right to drag someone here with me.

"I opened up to my therapist during our last appointment. It was hard. I had to talk to her about a lot of things I didn't want to open up about and still barely scratched the surface. She put in a referral to get a full psych screen done and is hoping that I can get it done over a break when I am home from school. Right now she told me to suspect I have bipolar disorder and I have to log my mood, sleep, and other symptoms daily and we will review it at each appointment.

The not-so-great part of this situation is she said during the appointment that she felt like ""I was pulling her tail"" and that ""these symptoms were too textbook"" she is still treating me so I am not too worried about this statement. Also, she said something along the lines of during the screening what's really going on will come out whether what I am saying is going on is the truth or if I am exaggerating. This actually makes me feel a little better because it will be a psychiatrist doing the screening I don't even know if she will be there at all. but I have been thinking about that a lot since that meeting. I explained to her that I am not making my symptoms up and she said okay but I am worried that there is going to be doubt in her head in the future. I am going to bring this concern up to her at my next appointment. This all just sucks because now I am starting to doubt my own feelings and have gotten into my own head. I know what I have been experiencing but now there is that little voice in my head telling me I am just making it up.

The other thing is I am not letting my mother know what is going on. When I brought this up to her in the past she started to freak out and tell me that I am not bipolar and then started spiraling saying that she is a horrible mother for not noticing the symptoms and it just isn't worth it. So since another suspected thing that I am being tested for during this screening is ADHD I told my mom that she put in the referral for ADHD.

I thought I was fine not listening to my doctor, taking a higher dose of medication.. The stuff makes me so depressed. I dealt with my drug addiction issues, and the stuff makes me feel so drugged. So I decided to stay on the dose I've been on for years, not doubling it like I was told. Things got worse, but manageable.. Not. 
I carved religious symbols into my body, making a deal with the devil.. I'm not even religious. Lost copious amounts of blood and subjected my wife to a horrific few days. said no cops, no hospital, I could keep pressure on it.. I wasn't suicidal. They said I was staring and unresponsive when the EMT and police showed up. My oxygen saturation was 80%, according to the report. I don't have much memory, blood loss, and come to find out, Ativan, have that effect. What little I do remember, I'm mortified. I assaulted several?people, lucky I'm not in jail too. I could barely stand though. 
I was in denial it could ever get this bad. But last week told me I need to get back to seeing a shrink, even though I'm stocked on so much medication.. I've been lying to myself. 
My ego is pretty shattered from this event. Family is grappling with it too. This is a wake up call for sure. Be honest with your support system, it could have prevented this. If you think you got super powers, it's best to let someone know so they can help you. Don't hide it.

He was cooperative going into the psyche ward, but now he wants out and thinks he can manage this on his own. He canâ€™t.

"The other day I was filling in for my supervisor. I work at a pharmacy and when they are away I usually take over their duties and type prescriptions. I'm usually the filler but I also type.

I come in and start typing and about 20 mins into it our head boss comes in and asks me to fill and that he will type the prescriptions. Anyway, the day went by smooth and I told our boss that when the supervisor found out he did such a great job that she'll want a vacation. 

The next day I come in and tell her what a great job the boss did. She replied: ""Well, I had him type because I know how upset and frustrated you can become.""

The wind in my sails were gone. I wanted to cry, she is not mean or anything but it sucked. I've lost it at work before and have had to leave and we've had talks about my bipolar so everyone knows.

"Hey everyone. So I'm on 750mg Lithium and 1.5 mg Risperidone. I take 600 of the Lithium at night and 150 in the morning. Ever since I went up on the Lithium, it has just gotten extremely hard for me to wake up in the morning. Like I set my alarm for 7 or 8 or so, but as soon as it goes off, I immediately hit snooze and repeat until it stops and just stay in bed. I'm just so exhausted and groggy and it takes me forever to get out of bed. It's especially annoying because I prefer to workout in the morning so I can shower right after and be good for the rest of the day. I'd rather not workout later and have to take two showers a day. Because it's so hard for me to wake up, I just skip working out altogether because then I have other things I need to do and I missed my chance. I'd also like to wake up at 7 routinely so I have more time in my morning to do things. Has anyone else ever dealt with this? If so, how did you cope? Thank you for your attention.",bipolar_disorder

"The saga of texts to one of my best friends about my ""bad thoughts"" continued into today. He told me I needed to call my doctor and therapist. I told him no for two reasons. First, today is Sunday. I doubt they'd answer their phone. Second, they wouldn't be able to give me the kind of solution I'm looking for. If I called my therapist, she'd probably listen and offer coping strategies. I've exhausted all my coping strategies. I want change, not another pair of rose-colored glasses to try on. As for my doctor, she may have been able to call something into the pharmacy. But I've already posted about how I am a medical anomaly, and nothing is working for me like it should. At best, anything she prescribed would work for a short while and then stop working again. I'd be back to square one again anyway. So, what's the point? This rage is festering inside of me. I could rant about all the things my bipolar has taken away from me, but I don't see the point in that either. Why bother? Things will always remain the same, I am never going to get better, in fact, I might get worse. It's completely and utterly hopeless. You might be saying to yourself, ""Well OP, if you feel that bad, maybe you should go to the hospital."" I refuse. All I'd get there is meds and therapy, and I've already explained why I don't want either. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on Tuesday. She's probably going to want to tweak meds, but I've reached a stage where I doubt I'll even let her. There's literally only five antipsychotics on the market left that I haven't tried. Five.

"OK so for some context I havenâ€™t been manic a good month pretty stable but I was really behind on a project for school so I decided to stay up for 30+ hours and now I am not tired whatsoever I was told that the symptoms of exhaustion is no longer being exhausted or something like that. Iâ€™m a little concerned I may have induced mania but I Have no clue bc if I did itâ€™s not bad my typical test is to drink caffeine or eat sugar and see how much the energizes me that only works if my mania is bad.

Anyways whatâ€™s the likely hood I may have enduced mania from not sleeping for 30+ hrs straight? 

And what are some tests bc tbh Iâ€™m pretty energized rn I was tired for the first 20 hrs but ever since I past around 24 I felt fine and after finishing my project for class I feek even more energized, maybe itâ€™s excitement from finishing a projects?

Dw I plan on trying to sleep within the hour. Iâ€™m just concerned bc I feel perfectly fine on no sleep for 30 hrs. Also I typically talk a lot of lack of sleep and in general so idk if me talking a lot in this is a good measure of mania",bipolar_disorder

"I started lamotrigine on Tuesday and haven't really noticed any side effects yet, as expected at the starting dose less than a week. 

I just don't know what im going to do if this doesn't work for me. Usually i feel pretty hopeful but ive been fighting to try lamictal for so long and been denied by NPs. Now that i am seeing a psych md he told me he thinks this is the best choice for me to try next. It was a huge relief but now that im doing it, im overwhelmed with anxiety about if it doesn't work or if i get the rash. 

I am SO anxious. 

 I'm terrified of getting the stevens johnson rash. I keep thinking about when i had an allergic reaction to penicillin and had to go to the hospital. That was terrifying and this rash would be infinitely worse.


I feel like any other medication is going to continue to have terrible side effects for me and i need the relief  so badly. Ive got some metabolic issues that make some meds a bad idea for my health, even with cognitive effects aside.

3- i was diagnosed when i was 2/3 done with law school and i wish i could have found out sooner and just not chosen a high stress/ high intensity career. By the time i figured out I'm bipolar, i was already deep into the financial and time investment and it made no sense to stop. 

I've been doing okay with this. I finished my third year with strong grades but I had to stop my medication to do that because it was making me sleep all day and be a zombie. I tried 3 before i went off it. I passed my licensing exam by forcing myself into an exceptionally regimented study /sleep/ exercise regimen. I did well at my first job other than a hypomanic episode that presented at work with ADHD like symptoms. I had to go on seroquel, which brought me down but made me too tired and foggy to focus. 
I hung on, but my lack of focus was noticeable to my boss. He mentioned it to me when he grew frustrated with me making silly mistakes and being distracted.

Now i have a new job and its also going fine but now im in a place where if i fuck up my career can be completely ruined. 

I stayed just on wellbutrin for a year and a half , was affected for a long time after by an abusive relationship with my classmate that i got into because he helped me when my family wasn't there for me while i went through the pretty devastating manic episode (got to the point of daily panic attacks, no concept of time, and some milder psychosis)

So I came to ask anyone else on Lamotrigine and antidepressants, what antidepressant do you use along with it? Curious to what might be tried next.

Took me a while to wake up and feel good, but now I feel totally fine. In fact, I might end up doing it again tonight-- at least until 2AM, maybe not later.

Does the brain stuffed with tissues feeling and the headache go away after some time, or is this just how it is?

"Diagnosed BP2 (manifested from SSRIs for anxiety). I was on abilify for 7 years and while it managed my symptoms well, I developed TD in my right side. Bad twitching in my eyes &amp; mouth, right hand spasms. My med manager bounced me around to different medications after I first started showing symptoms, and then bounced me to different psychs who couldnt find anything that didnt cause it. And it kept getting worse, until I cold turkey'd the atypicals. It clears up 100% when I'm off meds, but then I get manic and severe bouts of anxiety &amp; panic attacks, spend all my money, make risky &amp; impulsive decisions, etc, and I will go days without sleeping. 

I've been off meds for 2 years now and this week my doc put me on an incredibly low dose of seroquel to help with sleep (id slept 16 hours in a week) and help me come down from a manic episode, but my face is already twitching slightly near my eye and mouth, and my right hand is twitching a lot. Would you suffer the physical manifestation of the disability and risk it worsening to keep your mania under control, or would you rather live with the unstable mood?

Iâ€™m an artist, I love drawing, making music, and writing, and when I was on those meds it felt like that part of me was blocked off. On top of that, the meds made me gain weight and I developed stretched marks, and having body dysmorphia that warped self perception so much. Iâ€™m not gonna act like everything has been fine since Iâ€™ve been off my meds, but Iâ€™d rather deal with the manic episodes and everything else than go back to whatever version of me that was when I actually was consistently taking meds.

"Hi, IDK if this is the right sub to ask in since IDK if I have bipolar, I just tend to have episodes of mania, but this is the only sub known to me that even deals w the topic of mania !!

I identify as a lesbian and have done so for a while. My issue is, IDK if meeting certain types of men will trigger an episode of mania or not, but if Im in an episode I will go completely hypersexual for men and forcibly feminize myself for them and, if a man accepts my advances or something, end up completely traumatized afterwards. I know that I usually do not have any interest in men, and I know that theres no ROMANTIC interest in them anyways, but during episodes I tend to get super obsessed with them and make myself emotionally dependent on them. 

Ive seen a good amount of posts by bisexual or flexible people that say they'll lean a lot more towards one gender during an episode, or that theyll get hypersexual, but I havent really read about any lesbians that develop heterosexual tendencies or heterosexuals that develop gay/lesbian tendencies.

"its the time of the year, i think. manic time. i was due for one anyway, last one was more than a year ago, and i am a slave to the cycle. my sleep is barely existent, and in fact the less i sleep, the more energetic i feel. i am looking at 2-4 hours max, not uninterrupted. i have been forcing myself to eat, because i have an (obscure) ED and it will spiral if i dont eat. i am enjoying all this serotonin going around, because i dont get it very often. 

i have noticed something that hasnt really happened to me in this extent. the past few days the smallest think that hurts my insecurities will set me off (despite feeling awesome otherwise) and i will start ugly crying and then hysterically laughing and still crying at the same time. for example, bf made a very obvious joke about me being bad at social stuff, and the above happened. note that it was not malicious at all, just a joke, but i am a little socially weird, i do admit. still does not warrant wailing though. 

i dont even know where i am going with this. DAE get these fits? it is intense as balls and i am emotionally confused. i feel great so why am i crying? and then why the hysterical laughs that turn back to crying? i do not understand. i would like a little reassurance, i dont know anyone bipolar irl and i feel like a weirdo.

"I just moved and saw a new psychiatrist. Iâ€™ve had two years of treatment with two other doctors before this. Related, my long term boyfriend who I live with is a psychiatrist. 

The new psychiatrist tried to change my Schizoaffective diagnosis to borderline personality disorder. He said because I havenâ€™t been hospitalized and due to my history of severe childhood trauma. He kept saying over and over it didnâ€™t make sense that I wasnâ€™t hospitalized.  

I told him I certainly should have been but lived in a very rural area at the time with a mother who hates doctors.

"Hi. My nameâ€™s Izzy, 25F. I was diagnosed with bipolar in 2017. Iâ€™ve been on a lot of different kinds of medications, for now Iâ€™m on the Abilify Maintena injection as well as Seroquel, but the medication thatâ€™s been more of a constant throughout my course of treatment has been the Seroquel. I was on lithium for a while but they took me off of it quite a long time ago. 

I wanted to ask other members of this Reddit page who have some experience with antipsychotics, to be honestâ€¦ Iâ€™ve noticed that ever since I started taking them, Iâ€™ve had a lot of muscle stiffness. I also experience overwhelming degrees of lethargy throughout the day, and sometimes at night, after taking my medication, I just get so hungry. Iâ€™ve put on some weight. At first, it as just 3 kg, which isnâ€™t nearly as bad as itâ€™s been for a lot of people around the world. However, I gained an additional 5 kg after starting Abilify Maintena, despite my psychiatrist telling me that Abilify Maintena is weight neutral. A part of me wonders whether she just told me that to shut me upâ€¦ as I see a lot of other people on Reddit have put on weight taking Abilify Maintena.

I wanted to ask members of this Reddit page, particularly ones whoâ€™ve taken antipsychotics and who have been weaned off of them with the help of a psychiatrist - what was life like after you stopped taking antipsychotics? Was it harder, or was it manageable? Why did you stop taking antipsychotics? What Iâ€™m really interested in knowing is, do the side effects go away? Does the muscle stiffness go away? Does the tiredness go away? Do the hunger pangs go away? Does the weight go away, or does it stubbornly stay on after that? Does your metabolism ever recover from years of using antipsychotics? Does your motivation ever return? Ever since I started taking antipsychotics, I just feel so unwell all the time. Iâ€™m not as fit as I used to be, and am not as motivated as I used to be either. Iâ€™ve lost my drive to exercise as well as my sense of ambition, and am just going through the motions, and it really hurts me. When I started taking Abilify Maintena, not much really changed. The muscle stiffness stayed, the lethargy remained the same, the lack of motivation remained, and well, as I mentioned, I gained some weight.

I think I am generally not on too much medication, and eventually hope to wean myself off of it as I really am personally quite adverse to taking medication because the side effects are just so bad for meâ€¦ as they are for a lot of people. I know it will take time, but I canâ€™t help but wait for the day I donâ€™t need to be on medication anymore. Or if anything, I hope to switch to a sleeping medication over antipsychotics, as my manic tendencies have only flared up in the past when I have been sleep deprived. 
Please note that I am in no way encouraging anybody to stop taking their medication, especially without the help of a licensed professional. Thatâ€™s dangerous. These are just my personal hopes for the eventual futureâ€¦ My bipolar symptoms have been relatively mild. I had a manic episode after fracturing my spine in two places and finding a 3x3x2.5cm tumour in my breast at the same time (which is when I got diagnosed) but I donâ€™t really blame myself for that. 

Sorry for rambling. 
Tl;dr 
to those who have been on antipsychotics and who have stopped taking them - how have you been feeling? Why did you stop taking them? What was your experience before/during/after taking antipsychotics? Do the side effects of the medication (e.g. muscle stiffness, lethargy, weight gain, lack of motivation, compromised metabolism etc.) ever really go away?

Thank you for your time in reading this! Hope to get some responses. God, I hope I didnâ€™t break any of the rules.",bipolar_disorder
