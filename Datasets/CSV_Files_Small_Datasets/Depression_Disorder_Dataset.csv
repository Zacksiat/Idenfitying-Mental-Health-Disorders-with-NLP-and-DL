"It happened on Saturday, and to be honest I didnâ€™t like the kid a lot. But he was sometimes nice to me. I almost killed myself when I was 12 but survived. I just wish he did too.

"Its weird that of all places, I chose reddit. I won't lie to you, I only came here to share my thoughts; I didn't even know this subreddit existed until a couple of seconds ago. Anyways, I do not consider myself depressed. But I every so often get a series of mental breakdowns and thoughts of hoping I die early. It didn't seem like an issue until it started coming more and more frequently. But I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't feel like my problems are big enough for my family to care about, like they are insignificant. Its just stuff like my grades and losing small things but it brings me a lot of anxiety and stress. I can't explain it to anyone. Plus, I don't want to seem like I need help mentally. I want to make sure my family sees me as happy and enjoying my time. Especially since I moved away from them. I also can't talk to my friends because they are new and don't ever take me seriously. Its even become a joke where I would say ""I just want to kill myself at this point"" and my friend would say ""Save it for the GCSEs"" because if someone dies during the exams everyone gets an A. I want to get a therapist, but I am living with someone who is tied to my family closely, so I don't want them to think I'm unhappy. What should I do? Someone please, help me.",depression_disorder
"I feel like a robot I wake up eat cook and clean take of my daughter and nothing else. I have no real friends no life no nothing Iâ€™ve tried talking to my family but no one really truly gets it ( my family is Christian so all they say is pray) they donâ€™t understand how deeply Iâ€™m hurting. Im sorry If this is all over the place itâ€™s hard trying to get all my feeling out, donâ€™t know how to put it into words. I also feel like a slave in my own home I do all of the house work no one every really helps all they do is make messes theyâ€™re all lazy. Usually I have a better grip over my emotions but lately itâ€™s gotten pretty bad. Iâ€™ve been crying like everyday havenâ€™t really been sleeping, donâ€™t have the desire to eat much either Iâ€™m pretty much forcing it. Iâ€™ve always had bad anxiety but Due to Trauma itâ€™s gotten worse Iâ€™m scared to leave my house it takes so much effort to just go to the doctor, store take my daughter to the park etc. she never gets to go anywhere or do anything and I hate myself because if it. I told my parents before that I wanted to give her away not too long after she was born I explained to them what I was feeling and they were no help. donâ€™t get me wrong I love her I just donâ€™t think Iâ€™m what she needs. I feel like Iâ€™m about to burst I visualize and fantasize about stabbing myself and sitting my wrists  almost everyday. feel like I have to reason to go on I never finished high school, donâ€™t really have much going for myself, I lack motivation, and I feel an extreme Detachment from people and reality. I donâ€™t really have a lot of ppl that would miss me and my daughter is young enough that she has time to forget me Iâ€™m tired of reaching out for help screaming for someone to see me and the pain that Iâ€™m in Iâ€™m over it. No one can say I didnâ€™t ask for help I love my family but there is nothing here worth living for in my eye and I didnâ€™t plan on living long anyway",depression_disorder
"I have been doing weekly therapy for about 3 months and I am not improving.  I have textbook depression symptoms primarily precipitated by my current financial problems, an abusive wife and a debilitating injury.  I am completely isolating myself, not exercising, unable to perform simple and routine tasks and unable to enjoy anything. It's affecting my work and my attention to my children (two fifteen year olds).  

Being a health care professional, I have reservations about starting on an antidepressant.  I don't want to become dependent and I've hear that it is hard to taper off them.  But my current state is impacting everything and I am worried that it is affecting my kids.  My therapist also thinks it's time to start but respects my hesitation.

Appreciate any thoughts about my dilemma.",depression_disorder
"context: (~24(M) INTP-T with severe GAD and depression, OCD, antisocial, very jealous/clingy type, doesnt have many friends, doesnt talk to friends much)

My on-and off long distance relationship of 5 years has ended about 5-6 months ago. We seemed to have had a misunderstanding of what our expectations were in the relationship, and she broke up with me and told me that I will never find somebody that fits what I am looking for. And I agree. I have been in grief since then, and to my despair, have been dreaming of her quite often since then. Most of my dreams are of me getting the cold shoulder from her, or getting to pet my dog who has died a few years ago around her birthday. She has rabbits. It hurts me to see rabbits. Halo Infinite came out around the perfect time for me to fixate on it, as a way of coping, or else I don't know how much worse I would feel, but I'm at my new rock bottom in many ways, especially considering I do not have a job, I failed at getting my best chance for a good job, and I rarely ever have the confidence or drive to push through the immense anxiety that comes with something like that. I feel as if, if I were not a man, I would be able to find a relationship easier. 

She set up a condescending dating profile for me over a year ago when we had an argument. I 'fixed' that profile shortly after I got confirmation that she broke up with me 5-6 months ago, and found her profile in a few weeks since we were a ""98% match,"" and discovered that she had already found someone, and I'm happy for her, but it did hit me hard and made me realize I was still in the denial stage of grief. I had finally gotten a tablet and downloaded a game that she had wanted to play with me, and I wanted to tell her, but when I saw that, I realized the futility. I feel the same way I would feel of I had lost a family member who was suffering. A small percentage bittersweet, but mostly I feel deathly.

I have had some mutual interests with women on the dating site, but I know for certain that I am not in the position I my life that I'd need to be in to be worthy of a woman like that accepting a relationship with me, and I'd probably become jealous anyways. I can easily get panic attacks from jealousy, and prefer to date someone like me who doesn't really have friends, but that is really difficult for me to accomplish, and was the final straw in my last relationship. I understand that I am the problem. I don't believe I can change this type of thing, and medicine only does so little. My hair has also been thinning for years, and since the breakup has gotten out of control. My hair used to be the thing that gave me the majority of my physical confidence. I feel doomed, and every day feels like I wake up and think that I am in some type of cushiony hell. My heart weighs deep, and the best way I can describe it is a black hole. Dense, heavy, devoid of light, and the memories of her are being spaghettified at the event horizon. At least I'm not at my wits' end, since I still have my wit and dark humor. But with essentially no one to share it with. As an INTP, I am an extreme example. I spend my life brainstorming worlds in my imagination and taking notes, instead of worrying about reality as much as I should, but the pain always follows. I have failed. I have failed. I am not desperate, but I feel the despair. I have to stay true to myself, if I am to simply be. Time doesn't heal me. I have learned this over many years. I have been cheated on by other exes and ghosted. Romantic love is such a major aspect of me as a person, and I implode in its absence. I woke up today and felt compelled to write all of this. I fear this, and everything to come and for things to never begin.",depression_disorder

"Im generally unhappy with my life and its something i sometimes just shove aside as is what it is but othertimes like now it really just eats away at me. 

Ive dealt with trauma from family growing up which has severly damaged my self esteem and my self worth. I constantly overthink everything i do, feel like every person has it out for me, and feel like no matter how hard an effort i put out its still just eh for everyone. To put it bluntly im a male whos had issues with his father growing up. Verbal and physical abuse which has caused trauma to my mental state. 

I feel like im just stuck in going through the motions of this, and it sucks because i can tell my mood does affect those around me. (I do have a fiance who usually can tell when something is off, i have talked with her about all this and shes been understanding and wanted to help but my mind constantly goes back to this exact state) i never mean to have my issues impact others and it just makes me feel worse about it when i do have outbursts/down moods. 

I do sometimes have thoughts of life and everyone would be better if i didnt exist (not wanting to take my life i know thats not the answer to any issue) but i really have feelings that i wish i wasnt born. 

Im just sick of dealing with this and dont know what to do anymore.",depression_disorder
"My 32yo sister is severely depressed and has been for over a year. Sheâ€™s had mental health issues for many years but over the past year itâ€™s become much worse.

She hasnâ€™t worked for over a year and is supporting herself by borrowing money from family and friends, but mainly our parents. She lives with roommates in an expensive city. She is drinking and smoking weed daily, and spends a lot of time watching TV in bed and ordering Uber eats. She has a reasonably good support network in terms of family and friends but nothing seems to help and nobody knows how to help her. 

She has been seeing a therapist for many years, the same person. She is medicated but clearly the current medication isnâ€™t enough. Her doctor wanted to switch to a new medication but she is worried about stopping her current one so hasnâ€™t switched. 

Whenever we ask her about looking for a job she just says something like â€œitâ€™s really rough out thereâ€ or â€œdoesnâ€™t seem like thereâ€™s much aroundâ€, and even when weâ€™ve found good jobs open that meet her interests, she doesnâ€™t have the confidence to apply and does not submit applications. 

Itâ€™s painful to see her like this and we think she needs more help, but what? People in this community that have come out the other side, what was helpful?

Thereâ€™s also the secondary issue of money - as a family we keep giving her money but itâ€™s expensive given her lifestyle (expensive rent, lots of Uber eats and alcohol/weed). However our parents live in other cities and we also have concerns about forcing her to move cities to move back in with our parents. We donâ€™t have anywhere in her current city that she could live rent free.

As a family we can afford to support her for a while or pay for whatever help she needs but continuing to just give her money when she isnâ€™t seeking more help or moving forward doesnâ€™t seem like itâ€™s getting us anywhere. Weâ€™re not sure whether continuing to just hand over money is helping or hindering. Does anyone have advice on this point?

Thank you in advance for any advice this community can provide, weâ€™re simply stuck and not sure how to help.",depression_disorder
"I was called ugly all my life, been made fun of in middle school, my friends called me ugly on a daily basis. 

I finally started to feel a little better because since I started highschool people started complimenting me more I was actually hit on by both man and women. I made out with 3 people and kissed 2 other. Yesterday I made out with a random girl in the middle of the street that called me beautiful and now she is flirting with me, my friend that has a crush on me curently kissed me on the lips, my beautiful crush also liked me physically (didn't work out though). Also an ex crush offered to get me off in the school bathroom. And my self esteem was kinda high so I wanted people to rate me and they all rated me 5.5, 6 and 6.5 ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ And also said I look quirky??

"Iâ€™ve struggled with depression for over a decade now, but lately itâ€™s been more severe than itâ€™s ever been. I finally just now broke down crying and spilled my soul to my husband, telling him how hopeless and tired and done Iâ€™m feeling. I never have the time to do anything I enjoy, Iâ€™m in an abusive workplace but I canâ€™t quit because I have massive debt and bills and responsibilities that are crushing me, I never have the energy to take care of the house and that makes me even more depressed because of the guilt I feel knowing he picks up the slack when I canâ€™t function. I just sobbed and spilled my guts and expressed how hopeless and useless and stuck I feel and heâ€¦didnâ€™t say anything. He just sat there and didnâ€™t say a thing. And itâ€™s not like heâ€™s never seen this side of me, like I said Iâ€™ve struggled with depression for over a decade so for as long as heâ€™s known me he has known my depression. But he didnâ€™t say a thing. No words of comfort, no promises that he will help me, nothing. Now I donâ€™t know who to turn to. I thought he of all people would be there for me and help me but he didnâ€™t say anything. So I asked him to please leave me alone and he justâ€¦left.

"Hello Friends of Reddit :) I am looking for opinions and advice from people who have experienced depression. 

I(30f) recently met and started dating a lovely guy (25). We work at a remote hotel and live in a small community. We met while out drinking with a few people. He flirted with me heavily at first, but I brushed it off. Then we met again within a group at a super bowl party. We stuck together all night talking and laughing, I was very charmed by his warm and open energy. From there we went on a couple official dates and itâ€™s been so easy but also exciting. Iâ€™m falling for him 100% and it feels mutual. 

Now, a couple weeks into seeing each other which is also about 2 weeks ago now, he starts opening up about how much he doesnâ€™t like his job. He says he puts on a fake face at work and has to drink a ton of coffee to keep it up. I can relate that itâ€™s a stressful job as I do it too (serving). He also tells me he hates feeling trapped in this small community, especially as itâ€™s winter and will still be a couple months till it warms up where we are (north eastern Canada). These comments snowballed untill I could see that he was depressed. He made the great choice to stop drinking untill he feels better, which I fully support. He is withdrawing socially. He told me about a week ago that normally when he feels â€œlike thisâ€, he would push me away, but isnâ€™t going to because he really likes me. I found this to be great communication and I want to trust that itâ€™s true. However, we went from spending most nights together to just going 3 in a row where he wanted to sleep alone. Thankfully through this weâ€™ve been getting out for drives, he keeps up with errands ect so it hasnâ€™t all be holing up in his room. But 3 days in a row needing space has me concerned, even though I want to be understanding and trustful. 

I have dated a man with severe depression before, and I learned a lot. Iâ€™ve always known if I had another shot at love with someone similar I would â€œdo it betterâ€. I want to give space while keeping the connection. 

Iâ€™d love to hear any similar stories or advice :) thank you for your time !! ðŸ’•ðŸ’•",depression_disorder

My brother does the majority of the work around the house and helps me a lot when I need it.  (I have physical problems which make doing certain things hard or impossible)  I have always hated being a burden to him, to make things worse I'm waiting for disability or ssi.  I've tried to find some ways to earn money online so I could at least pay rent and give my brother some money for all he does, but haven't been successful.   

I've helped him out with other things when we were younger but now he doesn't need me for anything.  Now knowing he is leaving my depression is worsening as my anxiety is trying to skyrocket.  My mind is just in a mess.  Worried about where he is going, if he will be okay, what I'm I going to due without his help?  Mostly worrying about if he will be okay.   I know I can't be selfish and ask him to stay.  Not that he would.  But I hope he will at least stay in contact with me.  I just worry I'll never see him again.

My mind also keeps telling me its all my fault.  As the older sibling I was supposed to be taking care of him, helping him out.  I'm also worried how our cats will feel with him gone.

"So back in January I met a girl at a club I went to. I thought she was gorgeous and so I went up to her, talked to her, I got her number and over the next 2 days we went on 2 dates. They went great! We ate, went to the movies, kissed, talked a lot, we connected really well. However, she left to college 8 hours away from me (I live in Miami) back in January.

However, she came back yesterday for spring break and last night, while I went out with some of my friends, I ran into her. She said she was happy to see me but she was really drunk and she was with friends. We kissed (I noticed she was a little hesitant) but I found it impossible to just spend one on one time with her and now Iâ€™m overthinking a good amount.

"I (33/M/Canada) have depressed off and on for over a decade. Iâ€™m gay, single, and generally appear successful with a good job and all. However I am becoming more and more miserable to the point where I canâ€™t do anything except the basics. I fantasize about suicide every day. 

I have a friend group but am becoming more obsessed with worries I donâ€™t belong or that I am not important to my friends. I have always felt I might be on the autism spectrum, albeit high functioning, as social interactions are always terrifying and bewildering to me. I struggle to read signals correctly. Itâ€™s even worse with the depression because I have nothing to talk about it and struggle to carry conversations 

I also worry that I will burden my friends if I share too much with them. About half know about my depression but none know about my constant suicidal ideation. 

I have been trying meds and therapy but I am afraid to be upfront about how bad it is by mentioning suicide. I donâ€™t want to risk being committed at the hospital or losing freedoms. Iâ€™ve read that wonâ€™t happen if they donâ€™t think you have a plan but it still seems like a risk. I also donâ€™t want to risk involving my family who I barely talk to.

its just my thoughts.. sry if they arent well written..

Do you ever feel like you screwed up?

I miss you, I can't stop thinking about all of the good times we had.

Yet I hate you.. I hate that i miss you, and I hate that i can't stop thinking about

Everything we used to do.

I don't want these feelings, I want to be happy again even if I'm alone.

Why do I have to miss you.. You made me feel so bad about myself.

I want to see you again but I know from others that you don't feel the same.

We both still have things from each other, whether itÂ´s clothes or anything else..

I want to get my things ofc, and I bet you want your things as well but..

We can't meet..

We couldâ€¦

But you don't want to..

I could just go put them in your mailbox..

But you said it yourself that you don't want to put my things in my mailbox..

So how am I supposed to get my things?

I know you aren't reading this, and I don't actually know if you want to meet.

But iâ€¦

I keep hoping to see you..

Just know if you are reading this..

I was hurt for what you did, you knew it when we talked before too..

Yet your choice was to ignore it..

It wasn't my idea to block you on everything, I didn't want to leave you..

Because I know how that feels..

And i didnt want you to feel that way, with all our memories too.

Yet I choose to listen to my friends, it's for the best they said..

You'll be better off without her..

I can see you're hurting, don't do this to yourself..

And I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt, but..

I got home..

Looked at your apartment..

And in the window.. There he was.. The guy I thought was my friend..

Yet making sure i saw him undress nothing and jumping into bed again..

I..

I.. broke.. I blocked you on everything..

I was so sad and just wanted everything to be overâ€¦

But I wanted to talk to you like you said you would after he went home..

But you didn't want to see me after I left ofcâ€¦

I get it..

But it doesnt change that I still hope you're going to knock on my door some day.

I hope to see you outside with that smile you always had..

But i'm terrified to see you..

Not for what you did that night but..

I'm terrified that I would get all the feeling back..

And I don't think I can handle that break again..

I want a hug.. Like you asked me before he arrived that day..

When you said on that day you still loved me..

And you just wanted to do nothing..

You said you weren't really in the mood for that guy to come but..

You said he had travelled 2 hours to get there and you didn't just want to send him home again..

I gave you your hugâ€¦

you said you were going to over later when he left..

Because it wasn't the plan for him to sleep there..

But he did..

I think I knew it was the last time..

You gave me that smile.. Heartwarming smile..

And I left..

I want my friend for movie nights back..

My..

I want my feelings back..

I keep feeling empty and then my body tries to cheer me up..

But all it keeps showing me is.. You

You at that lovely restaurant..

Those few days before everything went to hell..

I keep seeing that outfit I choose, the makeup I put on you..

The goofy smile I had when we went for our date..

Your heartwarming smile at the table..

Now the chair is always empty in front of me..

And my mind goes..â€™â€™don't worry let me show you whos supposed to sit thereâ€™â€™

I see you..

With that smile..

I miss it..

Yet I hate you for that day..

I hate that you cared to ask me on the phone how I felt about it..

But given my answer I didn't like it at all..

You said.. â€˜â€™Oh, well it's not going to change anythingâ€™â€™

Why did you ask?

Did you even care?

I was going 45 on a 4 lane road and this woman just decides to gun it out of a parking lot. She didn't even bother to look. By the time i was slamming the brakes and honking the horn we had already collided. I ended up having neck trauma, a broken collar bone and a few broken fingers from the airbag.

 I wish i wasn't wearing my seat belt. I wish the airbag didn't work and instead i just went flying through the windshield. I can't afford a new car, i can't get to work because i can't afford an uber and city transit doesn't go to wear i work. I hate that everyday i get further and further in debt from what seems to things that are completely out of my hands. I just want it to stop. I'm sick of worring about finances, I'm sick of being in pain, I'm sick of constant misery. I don't have the strength to actually kill myself, i wish the accident did it for me.",depression_disorder
"So last week, 11CT, Me (22M), my step dad, and my mom went out to eat. My mom raised me her whole life as a single mother but we arenâ€™t that close, not like super close at least but my step dad was mad that my mom hasnâ€™t been working (which is how itâ€™s been so idk why he got some mad), long story short he pushed his hand to her stomach then smacked her in her mouth, my step dad is way smaller than me so I got up, I was in the living room, and they were in the kitchen), and I punched him once in the mouth and he pushed me back, and I just started pummeling him. My mom was screaming for us to stop and when she said was calling the cops I stopped. Then SHE STARTED YELLING AT ME. Kicked me out of the house, my step dad told me Iâ€™m not working for him anymore, and as he left the house, my mom told me to pack my shit and leave. My buddy in Arizona offered me a spot to go, and I thought I had enough gas to get over there. Iâ€™ve been stuck about a little over halfway there, gas has just got so expensive and has completely fucked me. My mom completely fucked me more than anyone ever has. My own fucking mom.

It was fun when I got here at first. I was away from my abusive mother who made me feel like I was loosing my mind, my roommate is cool, new big city, I'm studying what I'm interested in - everything is fine now, right?  
Well I guess the novelty of it has worn off. I feel like I've changed the scenery but not the situation. I still hate myself, I feel bitter and resentful toward other people because it turns out it's not enough to put yourself out there to make friends - you need to be likable too, something I've realized I lack. And it made me hate people, i don't know why.  
I want to be appreciative because I'm privilidged enough to live in a country where uni is  free and my parents pay for everything else. The only thing I'm supposed to do is study and I can't bring myself to do more than the bare minimum.

"I'm new on this subreddit and this is my first post so if I say anything that hurts or offends anyone then I apologize. With that said, I'll go into what I want to say. Recently I've been losing control of my life. Like seriously losing control. It all started as I entered college (haha I know another teenager) and I start the year by having big  goals of who I want to be and how well I want to do in college and life in general but slowly as time went on, everything started crumbling around me. My druggie dad started to manipulate my relatives to try and get back into my family and all the bad memories and feelings just came back and I went downhill mentally. I couldn't focus anymore. Everytime I tried to study, every bad memory would rush back and then I'd try to do something fun to get my head straight and go back to studying but it wouldn't work. After my monthly exam finished ( I got disappointing results) I got pissed off at myself. I knew I had no one to blame besides myself and I further spiraled back into depression. ( I've suffered from depression for years because of what my dad used to and if anyone wants more context on that then I'll make another post or just reply to comments). I couldn't sleep anymore and if I did then it would never be good or enough. I'd wake up late and still feel drained and tired. I stopped taking care of myself and gained weight lmao and even though I laugh at that happening my family occasionally makes fun of it and I started bailing out on my friends and i wore bigger shirts that didn't show my stomach. I'd try to get back into shape but I could never summon the will to go further than 3 days. Everything seemed pointless. I'll cut my rambling short (I'm sorry for pointlessly rambling) and just get to the point. I can't sleep anymore, I barely eat and when I do it's just Junk food. Im constantly depressed, tired,stressed and just filled with anxiety all the time. Im just tired of everything at this point. Even the little things. Idk if I'm just overreacting or if I'm slowly going crazy. None of this is fake and If you think it is then fair enough man.

I thought I was getting better mentally for almost 6 monthsbut I f***ing sunk again and I don't know why.

"I (F23) have depression, anxiety, ptsd, and bpd. Diagnosed at diff times so meds were changed a couple of times. My memory is deteriorating so much and so fast. The constant change of medications in the last couple of years has completely destroyed my cognitive abilities. 
I speak 4 languages that I taught myself and was learning 2 more before this mess. Iâ€™m a highly ambitious person. My teachersâ€™ &amp; professorsâ€™ most common comment about me was that I â€œabsorbed knowledge in unbelievable speed.â€ I donâ€™t even remember 99% of the shit I learned for my degree right now. 
Most important part of this is the following: Iâ€™m supposed to go law school within the next 2 years. I worked my whole life for that. Been studying for the LSAT since my freshmen year of undergrad. My score was amazing last time I took it. I wanted to take it just bc I was sure I could do better. I did a few practice tests recently to see how Iâ€™m doing, my score was so fucking low you wouldnâ€™t believe itâ€™s the same person who took it before. How am I gonna succeed in law school like this? 

To say the least, this side effect stings like hell. I donâ€™t even fucking know who I am anymore. I canâ€™t even remember what I read, cuz as soon as Iâ€™m done â€œlearning &amp; memorizing,â€ everything just disappears from my brain. Iâ€™m not working. Like my brain is not working anymore. 
Iâ€™m getting so frustrated with myself. There has to be a way to counteract the side effects somehow. 
I canâ€™t go off my meds. Like no chance. I finally found something that works. This is the first time in ages that I feel like I can even think clearly enough to address my memory problems bc I was too focused on addressing my mental health problems before. 

Have you experienced this? And how have you dealt with it?

tl;dr: how do you address memory problems due to medication?",depression_disorder

My life - A
Iâ€™m 42, font business failed after it was successful. No kids, no home, 70k debt, no friends, no husband, no assets (except my fonts, no boyfriend. Vendors &amp; corporations stole my fonts and wonâ€™t pay for licensing deals. I lost out on my baby making years because  of my busines. I also lost out on my youth years being pulled into my moms drama and to support my mom and dadâ€™s life. My friends used me because of my success and I had psychosis twice because of my business failing. My friends vanished at this point. My boyfriends didnâ€™t love me and just used me for my success and sex. I  recently lost my apartment in a large top city because I canâ€™t afford it.

Mom moms life - B

She had a man (my dad) that she met at 23. They had 3 kids and my dad loved her so much that he would stalk her at bingo. She didnâ€™t have to pay bills or mortgage. My dad paid for everything. She was a nurseâ€™s aid at the nursing home in our town. She got to keep her money because my dad paid for everything. My older brother was a shit disturber and made our lives hell. She focused on helping him and not my sister and I because she said we were good and didnâ€™t need help. She said it was so hard to have kids and a husband and her life was much harder than mine. My dad died of cancer when I was 32 and she said she had to do everything for him during his illness. She said her life was worse. Even though she got what most woman wants.

I could not perform at my internship and no one in my family tried to understand me at all. At home, my parents were overbearing and put a lot of pressure on me, criticizing me almost every day. At work, even though I was trying my best, I was not doing good enough. It was really hard and sometimes I would just CRASH. I was trying so hard to escape so I was spending almost every weekend drinking with friends just to feel a little happy. I was trying to do the therapy work and work through the issues, but because no one wants to listen or help me on the severity of my depression, I live with it undiagnosed and really really struggling. I put aside money for when I can get some help from a therapist.

iâ€™ve always had trouble letting things go. but like idk whatâ€™s wrong with me. I just got out of a relationship of 14-15 months and my emotions are really bad way worse than theyâ€™ve ever been and iâ€™ve tried to kill my self many times before. It was always my biggest fear losing her and being alone and now it came true. since feb 28th iâ€™ve been alone and fighting suicidal panic attacks/freak outs. i went over to my friends house a couple times but was losing my mind the entire time freaking out not being able to accept the fact iâ€™m never gonna talk to this person again. our relationship ended because i let my anger get out of control the whole reason we fell off was my fault. I tried to control how we were in our relationship because the first couple months we were together there wasnâ€™t commitment so i did anything to make sure it wouldnâ€™t happen again and now i just feel like a piece of shit who deserves to die. weâ€™d argue everyday almost and iâ€™d say 2 day of the week usually weâ€™d be screaming at each other. it got physical at times and before it would happen i would ask her to go home at least 50 times and sheâ€™d beg me to let her stay which would just make me more mad and more mad so that would end in us breaking up then getting back together the next day. all this relationship was me fucking it up with my impulse. i really had a real one and let my ego and overthinking get the best of me. she blocked me on every social media and possible way to contact her. her brother and sister who are older asked how i was doing and so just honestly let them know how much i missed her and just wanted to talk it out as friends and apparently sheâ€™s moving on and is finally feeling happy again. i just donâ€™t get it months and months of me just asking you to go home when we argue so we can cool off then she just blocks me on everything and completely cuts me off. I fucked up not signing out of one of her social medias and seen she already added a couple guys. i feel so lonely all my friends dropped me everybody just tells me to find something that distracts me or helps me feel like my self again but they donâ€™t get how fucking obsessed i am with this person and canâ€™t do anything with how codependent I am. i think we both have trauma from this relationship atleast me with how much weâ€™d scream and cry but it hurts a lot how easy it is for people to move and let go after doing so much together.,depression_disorder

"Iâ€™m 27 years old. From the age of 3, I knew I was transgender. The last time I remember being genuinely happy was when I was 5 years old. Since age 6, Iâ€™ve been on a downward spiral. When I was 8, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and generalized anxiety. At age 15, I began to cut myself, and I seriously considered suicide for the first time. The only reason I didnâ€™t off myself is because I didnâ€™t want my mom to find me. She died a few years ago.

A few months ago, I again considered killing myself. I didnâ€™t do it because I didnâ€™t want my dad to find me. Also, at the time, my brother and aunt died, within weeks of each other. I figured that he couldnâ€™t take any more pain. I checked myself into a mental hospital. That place was a complete joke. The staff didnâ€™t know what the fuck they were doing. After 8 days, I lied and said I was feeling better. I spent about 11 days there.

Iâ€™ve been on testosterone for 5 years. I pass as male, and have a consultation for top surgery. But I will never have a genuine male body, and that hurts. I want to rip my skin off.

Iâ€™m living with a friend right now, and Iâ€™m desperately trying to hold on. After almost 5 months, I relapsed on self harm. When I told her, she was frightened, to say the least. I promised her that I wouldnâ€™t do it again. But that was literally the only coping mechanism that worked. Iâ€™ve tried at least six different meds for depression. They either didnâ€™t work, made me feel numb, or only worked for a few weeks.

I have everything to look forward to. I literally have no reason to be depressed or suicidal. I shouldnâ€™t want to cut myself. Objectively speaking, my life is going well. Yet, here I am.

Iâ€™m an empty husk of a human being. Every breath feels like a chore, every heartbeat, a curse. Depression and gender dysphoria have ruined my chances of a happy life. I literally canâ€™t stop obsessing about killing myself and cutting.

For me, loneliness takes up much of the space in my daily life. I think about 99% of the time about what is wrong with my life, why am I depressed, why am I the way am I, why I have depression in the first place to think about it.

I've been living like this for years. It has already passed that point long time ago I no longer think about possibilities about any change in my life. It gets harder and harder I think while you get older. 

Depression is no joke, there is no such a thing as being just little stressed about it. Don't hide it. Seek help immediately earlier the better. Do not end up in life like me.",depression_disorder

"I used to have a lot of friends and family that I could go to and talk to. Over the years, Iâ€™ve had to cut off a lot of family, especially my fathers side, due to toxic behavior. Iâ€™m not really close to my moms side. And now the small amount of friends that I hadâ€¦ Iâ€™m not that close to anymore. They all have their own lives, oneâ€™s getting married, other two starting their careers. We also just donâ€™t have a lot in common anymore. 

I have no one to go to and I have very little support and when I do talk to them, all they want to do is misunderstand what Iâ€™m saying and argue with me. So I just start repressing everything or posting on Reddit. I canâ€™t afford therapy but I didnâ€™t have any success when I did go. I just long for that companionship. That feeling of not being so alone, of having someone to talk to. I donâ€™t have that anymore. I feel like I was just a stepping stone to help them through their problems and they moved on and I got left behind. I feel so alone.",depression_disorder

"I've been idealising suicide for years, but this was the first time I wasn't scared in that span of time. I wasn't scared, I wasn't worried, I wasn't...hesitant. It felt like bliss. Some of these days, I just find myself wanting that feeling again so I can finally get it done.",depression_disorder

"Dear people on Reddit maybe youâ€™ll listen, 


Dad- Youâ€™re a nasty person 
Dad- I will never go in her house 
Boyfriend- I think about why Iâ€™m with you I donâ€™t cum with you and if I was with someone I might want to marry them
Mom-What type of daughter are you
Bf- I wish he would love me unconditionally. I wish he wouldnâ€™t have any doubt that he wanted to be with me. He has put me through a lot of roller coasters. He has gas light me a lot. He always says what his attracted to but nothing describes me. I can never tell where I fall with him. Iâ€™m never good enough. Never sexy enough. Never supportive enough. I been over backwards day and not and get nothing in return. Sometimes I wish he would just pick what he wants and stop hurting me mentally. 
Mom- I am tired of being her therapist. I want a regular mom. Someone who loves and cares about to not put me in the middle. I wish she could be strong for me. I wish that she showed me what  to do when a man is not treating you right. Maybe I would be able to stand up. Maybe Iâ€™d be the women My bf might want to marryâ€¦..
Mom- where do I startâ€¦. He didnâ€™t care that my cousin touched me. He even let him in the house many times. He told me that I was nasty and disgusting. He didnâ€™t care if I told my mom because she wasnâ€™t going to do anything. He was right. She couldnâ€™t and wouldnâ€™t take up for me. He told me he didnâ€™t have to answer the phone for me. He said he would never go in my house. Now he wants to talk to ask me why I donâ€™t talk to him or say I love you. He has never said sorry for what he did to me. He was the first man to set the tone on my life and how I picked men. 

My therapist told me that you either pick a man different from your father or the same. Honestly I feel like I picked someone like him. Emotionally unavailable, hurt full, manipulative. I tend to float to people like this both romantically and Friendships. Idk I feel like everyday that past Iâ€™m going to kill my self. I keep picking a day but get to scared. Like I always say oh once everyone is okay or when I pay car off etc. sometimes I wish someone would do it for me. Take the pain away let me be at peace. Away from the hurt and trauma from other people. I remember being choked and passing out all I remember is just a peacefulness. I sometimes miss that feeling. Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m asking fir help just in sudden ways. Like Iâ€™m asking for attention. Iâ€™m scared if no one pays attention soon Iâ€™ll be gone. Like I think about doing it but then I think about how people will be disappointed. But I think about people just moving on and Iâ€™d just be a little bump on road. Like who am I to think I play any real part in anyoneâ€™s lifeâ€¦ I wasnâ€™t born with any talent.

I constantly find myself comparing myself to people in everyday life and putting myself down since I am a child, I am just wondering is there anyone else who has had similar struggles their is times I feel like I am completely insane  and like no matter how hard I try I will always fall back into this black hole it makes it extremely hard to to find the motivation to continue with daily life when I was 18 I strongly considered taking my own life after a breakup but I didnâ€™t, but I can feel myself slipping into that same hole again.

"Here my short story: i have never been diagnosed with depression but when you know, you know.

In September, I moved to Europe (a very sunny and nice climate country) for a job, hoping to find happiness. I have a great teaching job surrounded by sweet students who put a smile on my face. However, outside of work. I'm nothing. I find it impossible to wake up in the morning. somedays when I am off work, I will keep sleeping until 10am, 12pm, 2pm, or until I finally feel like I have some energy. The problem is that when I wake up so late, there's hardly any sun outside and I feel like my day has ended already. 

I only have 2 real friends (one is my boyfriend back in Canada with a 6 hour time difference) and the other friend just sees me when she has no one else to be with. I dont do anything on weekends except play animal crossing, read, play soduku, watch Netflix or go on walks. 

Every, single, day, is a struggle to get out of bed. And when I don't want to get out of bed, I just have no desire for anything. I want to quit my job and die.  And I have ALWAYS felt this way my whole life, no matter what I do. 

I eat healthy, I clean my apartment every weekend, shower everyday, rarely workout but at least get some steps in, and I overall don't have any problems in my life other than my depression. 

Does anyone have advice for me?? Or maybe I just wanted to get this off my chest or for someone to listen to me. Thanks.",depression_disorder
"I was extremely suicidal about two years ago. I was sad, depressed and anxious all of the time. I kept thinking how my mother would react and im sure it would have devastated her. Thats why I didnt do it. I had written my goodbyes and made a clear plan. I was going to hang myself. Somehow I had the courage to open up to my mother and she got me into therapy.

I went to therapy and managed to finish my bachelors. I also got a Job at a fancy hotel and I worked there for about 7 months. But because of my anxiety I havent been able to keep a job. This has made me realize that I have failed and that I wont be able to keep a job. I have been unemployed for 2 months now and my saving are running out sooner that I expected. I know I wont be able to live in the shame again.

So now. I have a plan about my suicide but this time its different. Im calm and caltulated, im not worried about my loved ones because I know they have a strong circle. Im scrared that I actually might do it but at the same time im relieved to know that I can end it all because in the end I dont have to worry about my weaknesess anymore.",depression_disorder
"Hello there,

I am currently feeling like shit.

Okay so let me start by saying some things about myself.

 I am a 17 y/o male and am currently in 2nd year of high school. My family are Asian so expectations of study are tremendous.

I perform reasonably well in my tests, scoring about 80/100 \[Math\] ; 95/100 \[Chemistry\] and 90/100 \[Physics\]. My strongest subject is Chemistry and the weakest is Math. Idk how that helps but thought that it might be helpful while ascertaining my condition.

Since about 3 weeks; i have been feeling a bit low key and am having strange and violent dreams. I had a ""rough"" childhood. My head is constantly hurting while eating, sleeping and hell, even while taking a shit. My thoughts are dark and often lead me to an out-of-body experience (idk if anybody understands that) . I DO NOT TAKE DRUGS.

Well, this condition has happened to me in the past; about 2 years prior. I keep having dreams of killing people and mutilating their dead corpses and collecting something beloved to them as trophies. Some serial killer level shit but i used to control those urges and tried to restrain myself by not interacting with much people apart from my family. THE Pandemic was a good excuse but now, they (parents) are asking questions.

Necrophilia is by far the most insane shit i ever dreamt of earlier. Repression was a great deal of help but now, i feel like I'm sliding down a slippery slope. I'm afraid that i might give into my urges and god forbid; kill somebody.

The urges are at an all time high. Yesterday, i  choked my brother for no apparent reason and he had this look of fear as i let him off. I'm about 5' 9'' while he is about 5' 3''. 

I don't know what i would do so just wanted some help from your side.

" I feel like depression made me more and more stupid in the last few years. 

Can't concentrate or think deeply about anything. Have difficulty developing an interest in literally anything. My mind doesn't wander in different directions anymore, creating hypothetical scenarios or trying to spot patterns in stuff or solving problems. I have become clumsy and forgetful and my observation skills have severely degraded. I'm not as curious as I used to be and have no eagerness left to learn things. Been failing in college because my brain is literally too slow for all the studying I need to do.

My life feels so empty and stuck. I don't even talk to people anymore because I have nothing to say and socialising is very exhausting. I have no friends left anymore. 

I  got diagnosed and started therapy/medication but couldn't continue because I can't afford it rn(being a college student from a third world country with minimal mental health resources available, and what exists is expensive af). 

I tried improving my sleep, diet and physical activity levels but haven't seen any significant changes so far. I still feel so dull and foggy and fatigued in the head.

I now saw what is like to be without depression after all these years, and now i went back down in mood, and it's like i'm under a train and got depersonalization, i feel like my identity is destroyed, how can the mood be such an integrated thing with identity, i mean i lived under a grey cloud for more than half my life, maybe i was too scared to see the sun...

"So, I feel the need to start at the beginning. A week ago, ruffly around this time, a friend of mine I went to highschool with got into a car crash and lost her life. It's been a ruff week for all kinds of reasons. 

The thing I'd like to share however is my slow descent into madness as a result of her death. 

You see, about a year ago, give or take a month or 2, I was hanging out with her and her room when we all started talking about a car crash she was in a few months earlier. Her room mate noted a couple of car crashes and I off handedly made a joke about her doing it on purpose. Because she was drunk as however, he started going off on how if she had waited for the roads to be icier, she would have died and her kids could have gotten the insurance money. She went into how there are nicknames for the time of year and that no one would really bat an eye at it. I made sure her roommate (and self proclaimed best friend) knew what was going on and I tried to talk her out of it. I thought I had...

Fast forward to last week. We had shit weather all weekend and she ends up getting into a car crash. 

I can't say anything for certain. I don't even feel like it's my place to say anything to anyone about it. 

I've been crying on and off for the last couple days. Beating myself up for not being a better friend even though she didn't want me in her life anymore.

I'm feeling a lot and I don't have anyone to really turn too. Probably why I'm making this post. Because this is the internet I'm expecting to get nothing but hate but hell, I probably deserve it.

I thought and said â€œno big deal who caresâ€ Everything went absolutely amazing, we talked every day for hours. We went out to dates all the time and when it finally came up. She was afraid to admit it. Because from the beginning it was â€œno feelings just funâ€ but we admitted we had fell madly in love. We started saying it a lot, we didnâ€™t know what we were going to do but for the next 3 months we saw each other at least once a week with work and school. But then inexplicably we started talking less she told me â€œwe canâ€™t say love anymoreâ€ I was just trying to hold on to the ONLY true happiness I had had in years. So I agreed just Fwb. But then we grew more distant, for weeks I desperately was trying to just see her. She could never make time and she just kept telling me she was busy but wanted to see me, I got to see her once at her school before I left town because of my transient job. I told her Iâ€™d quit. I told her Iâ€™d stay if I could just see her every few weeks. Iâ€™d do anything she asked. She told me to leave, so I left. I went to my next job. Got back with my on and off GF for the last 7-8 years and life went on. We talked sometimes Iâ€™d buy her coffee; but a year later she just texts me â€œyou must think Iâ€™m a heartless bitch, fuck youâ€ I tried to see what she was talking about but she started blocking me on everything. Then she texted me â€œIâ€™m done I canâ€™t do this anymoreâ€

"22F here, I moved across the country to Wyoming from Florida with my boyfriend (28M) who I wasnâ€™t even with for a year yet. Stupid, I know. I quit my job that I loved, I left the place I called home, and had hopes for a clean slate in a new state. 

Things arenâ€™t going smoothly. Itâ€™s the total opposite of what I expected. Sexual issues, communication has gotten the worst itâ€™s ever been, minor but continuous lies from my boyfriend, which he told me heâ€™d be better about, lack of trust in him due to his lies. Baggage on his end causing major strain between the two of us (Mother in law, exes) . I made sure to not bring any baggage here on my end. Since I quit my well paying job in Florida to come here, my credit cards havenâ€™t gotten paid since November and my bank account is -$500. He told me he was gonna take care of me financially. He hasnâ€™t.

I lived alone with my dog and guinea pigs back in Florida for 2 years before I met my current boyfriend. I was stable in nearly every sense. I was happier. My moods and feelings werenâ€™t reliant upon some guy. I was in control of my own moods and emotions. I miss that so much. I miss my little overpriced 1 bed 1 bath apartment back in Florida that I had to myself. What am I doing with my life now?

I threw away everything I valued and loved about my life for some guy that canâ€™t even be honest with me on a consistent basis. For a guy that needs to be trained and told like a dog how to be romantic for me. For a guy who just doesnâ€™t understand me even though he likes to act like he does. I am so stupid. God, I am so stupid.

And you wanna know what the worst part is? I donâ€™t think I can get that blissful life I had before him back. I make $400 a month now. Iâ€™m not only broke, Iâ€™m in severe debt now. Things will never be the same. Because of my decisions. I hate myself, and I wish my overdose actually worked back when I was 18. I guess I canâ€™t even do that right. Iâ€™m quite literally good for nothing. I shouldâ€™ve done better for myself than this. I know better. I let my heart decide for me.

Iâ€™m a passive aggressive person when Iâ€™m irritated or sad so I tend to say a lot of shit that I donâ€™t mean that can hurt people. I have isolated myself from social media and friends. My family found out I self harmed daily (my sister hid all my razors and scissors but I keep a secret sharpener in my school bag-it doesnâ€™t cut deep so Iâ€™m constantly stressed.) I donâ€™t like talking about my self harm cutting issue so my family doesnâ€™t talk about it or question me since I yell and give them the silent treatment. People told me that Iâ€™m moody and say that Iâ€™m crazy or bipolar (I often get insults like narcissistic or a stupid bitch.) they question how I go from being funny and laughing to irritated and angry. Everyone is generally annoyed with me and tell me that there is something wrong with me (I sometimes think so but I canâ€™t find the answer.) my dad used to physically and emotionally abuse me when I was very young and he did it in front of countless of people (he has stopped but I dealt with bruises, blood blisters, damaged eye, and emotional stress around him.) I also dealt with anger issues in church and I fought and lashed at anyone because I was so short tempered and emotional (I would hit myself if I was really angry and stressed.) I was often hiding under tables at school and nervous when everyone was sitting around in the carpet and I was afraid of being near anyone. I was taken out of class to a quiet doll room and got in trouble a lot (I would get put in the corner to reflect on myself.) people say Iâ€™m very immature so Iâ€™ve been working on becoming a better person and I have big dreams. I think I deal with depression and anxiety but Iâ€™m not sure myself since I know I need a professional doctor to diagnose me (honestly I donâ€™t need a diagnosis I just need a answer to my problems.) I actually got taken to a doctor for a screening test by my dad (he lied about where we were going.) I answered every question no because I felt afraid and useless so I didnâ€™t want to reveal my emotions and thoughts. The doctor saw my scars but I got all irritated and told him that it is my privacy and he shouldnâ€™t touch me or force me to roll my sleeves and pants. We left without a problem and it was silent in the car ride. At the end of the church, I was stressed too much and while my dad was driving the car and telling me how I should stop and change how I look and act, I got very annoyed so I opened the door and thought of ending myself but he stopped immediately and I walked out through the streets until it was night and he found me and took me home. I went inside my room and cut myself until I bled and cried to myself silently while thinking of ending it all (the sharpener didnâ€™t go too deep vertically but I went over the same cut until I was satisfied and could not feel like crying anymore.) after he knocked on my door, I opened it and he cried. I felt so guilty but I was annoyed at everything and everyone. I pushed him out and locked my door again. Iâ€™m so useless and stupid. I just want help for my problems but Iâ€™m so scared. Why am I like this? I want to try so hard to change. I canâ€™t even face my fears Iâ€™m such a pussy. Please anyone give me advice and Iâ€™m sorry if itâ€™s too long. I donâ€™t want it to be longer. Sorry.(I downloaded Reddit since a lot of people were asking questions here.)",depression_disorder

But now there's nothing. Just depression and me, with no way out. Meds take forever to work, and that's even if they work. Sometimes it can take months to find the right blend/dosages. And in that time, I must just sit in this never ending low mood.",depression_disorder
"Euphoria 

Symptoms of euphoria include feeling happy or hopeful, increased self-esteem and finding increased pleasure in things you  enjoy.

There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling energised, sleeping deeply, having a good appetite and sex drive, and various waves of pleasure on the body.

The symptoms of euphoria range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently high spirited, while severe euphoria can make you feel extremely motivated, that life is worth living.",depression_disorder
"My husband still has no idea, no empathy, no understanding of depression. Granted I never discus it with him, but still. I have in The past and he just doesnâ€™t understand or get it. My house is not cluttered, dirty, etc. but I do get lazy with laundry, which he has never done in his life. He literally screamed and yelled this morning over socks.

"I am a 16 year old boy currently going to an art high school. I need to vent about quite a few things. First of all, I'm gay and I've been out for two years now, but the loneliness somewhat didn't go away. I'm in a relationship and I love him dearly, but I find myself sexually unsatisfied, and sometimes wishing we did more. I usually feel incredibly guilty after these thoughts as he loves me very very much, and I can tell that, and yet I'm slowly struggling to feel the same. 

My relationship with love and sex was fucked up a super long time ago, or at least it feels like that. It happened when I was 13. I have an older brother. He's a lot for me to deal with. He's from a previous relationship of my dad's, and is much older than me. He is obsessed with his looks and has been for a very long time, and also is severely mentally ill from various trauma inducing events as a teenager. As a younger chubby boy, I was his target. I was socially persecuted and cast aside while my sisters got all the attention. This made me hate him, and yet I was obsessed with his attention. I wanted him to care about me. In a really twisted way, I fetishized it, made it sexual. Especially since I felt so physically inferior. I was not out at this time but I knew I was gay, and I was easily able to tell the signs that others were gay that straight people don't seem to understand until later in life. My older brother was clearly gay to me. I began trying to make him like me, bond in any way possible. In ended in potentially the worst thing that has ever happened to me, but yet was my choice. 

We ended up having sexual interactions even though he was much older than me and I was very young. At the time I was incredibly determined to continue these interactions as I'd never felt that sense of care in my life before. It was horrific and I would get nauseous afterwards, but yet I kept being obsessed with the idea of me being something sexually attractive. My body was very unconventionally attractive at the time and I was incredibly insecure, so I forced myself to keep doing things with him. At a certain point it just stopped, and we never did it again. I tried to talk about it once to him but he closed up a lot and I've never tried again. I cannot tell anyone because of the worst part about this story: I was the rapist at first.

I was the one who was cuddling with him as his little brother, and ended up pulling his pants down that first time. I made the hell that I lived in for next year. I deserved it all. 

After it all stopped with my brother I needed another sexual outlet for validation and relief. I had all things romantically important stolen by older men in the back of cars or in small apartments. I was only 14 and my first kiss was a thirty eight year old who I had multiple sexual encounters with. I met with as many men as possible. Clogging my after school schedule with sharing myself. The most addicting part of it was that nauseous feeling I felt. It continued ever since that encounter with my brother, but now I was obsessed with it. It made me unable to eat, or really to think. It was like a drug. Since I wasn't eating I was the thinnest I'd ever been. It only gave me more reason to keep doing it. By 15 I had gotten into the school I'd wanted to go to since fourth grade, and that distracted me for a bit.

I met people, and they made the disgusting world of rape disappear for awhile. It was clean, childish, teenage, fun. I really liked them. We opened up to each other a lot, in unhealthy long winded ways, but it was something at least. It all ended badly. I eventually told them about my sexual experiences. I told them that I was happy that I was doing it. They adamantly fought against my actions, until I did it again. Then it was a joke to them. It became my personality. I was the gay boy who had sex with older men. That was what I was to them, and it was hilarious. They'd make jokes where they'd just say numbers, the age of a guy I had told them about, and they'd laugh. I laughed too, even though I didn't find it funny.

Luckily I didn't have to end those friendships, they did it themselves. They were self cannibalizing attention hungry average teenagers, and eventually I was the problem. I was too sexually confident, to openly gay because of the things I had done. They had the strangest jealousy. Their jealousy turned into anger against me. Their jealousy pushed me away from them. Their jealousy was sick.

Having to stand up for myself that one time made a lot of changes to my character.

I stopped my unhealthy interactions with older men. I focused on being a kid. I met people I really enjoy now, and really like talking to. All of this would be great except for the fact that I'm empty. My art is empty. My relationship with one of the prettiest and most interesting boys my age is empty. I don't know what to do. Worse than that, I'm gaining weight. My self hate used to manifest strongly enough that I had an eating disorder to keep weight off, but now that I've gone through the process of battling some of my negative thought patterns, I can't muster that hate. I've begun to feel as though without the touch of older men my body has bloomed into a disgusting new form, and my life has just become a series of lies to myself. I'm starting to see those same patterns of jealousy in my friends as well. Annoyance. I'm just a nuisance. I carry so much already that to carry a burden of a friend is too much. I've ruined myself. I've lost things that never will come back, and simply cannot come back.  

In many ways I miss being a victim. I miss being raped. I miss the world shattering emotional sensations of ruining my self image. I miss the feelings of being thin and wanted. I miss being someone who had to be saved, rather than someone who has to save others. My friends see me and they see someone much more competent than I really am. I just need a floor to stand on, and yet I ask for what I cannot give to others.

I want to be beautiful again, and I want to feel terrible again, and I want to feel virile again.

But I don't really want it, it's just what feels normal, and normal is what my brain always thinks I want.

I'm the emotionally healthiest I've ever been, but I'm struggling with making it normal. How do I make this state of ok-ness something that just happens? How do I accept my body in a way that'll let me healthily improve upon it? How do I feel sexually satisfied in my relationship without not only ruining it but pulling my boyfriend down with me? What is wrong with me? Is my life ruined?

"currently I would say I am doing better than what I once was a year ago. But frankly, it's mostly because of covid being less impactful in our lives now.

I talk to myself in my head a lot more, something that I restrained myself from doing when I was severely depressed, but the thoughts are about passive suicide. I talk to more people and girls, but it's just making me feel empty. I'm forcing myself to do all these things to feel like I'm doing something to become better. But I don't feel really ""better."" And when my mom says that I look a lot better/don't have depression anymore, I hate it because I am not better. I am not happy.

"Every god-damned day, it's one of the same like five scenarios. I wake up, check the time, sleep some more because I'm still tired. Then I get up for good and try to find something to do that doesn't cost money, because I usually don't have any money. I usually end up playing one of the same games I play every day or watching the same shows. Eating the same food. And listening to the same songs.

My life if you can call it that is pathetic. I live in a foreign country far away from my homeland and my family , sleeping on a couch in the same place as my ex who ditched me close to  two years ago , I do not have any friends in life or online no one to talk too or be with nothing.

As for moving out as of course living on a couch with you ex isn't the healthiest of options in getting your life together,  with my social anxiety and my fears of being 100% alone I just can't

I don't have anyone anymore no friends to talk to or to be with and the loneliness of my life is just crushing me there is no happiness anymore and quite frankly I just don't live anymore I just exist , and  starting to wonder is it worth it why bother anymore it's never going to change as I don't have the will or strength to change  it.

"Rant ahead:

Iâ€™ve had this type of same problem in my past relationships. When I would have a breakdown one would normally expect your partner to be there for you to comfort you, correct? Because this is what my therapist at the time told me that our partners should take care of each other when we are in need of comfort. But my partner at the time would just watch me breakdown and not do anything not even be an inch close to me, he would just wait it out. Until he told me one time, which is probably the worst thing told to me is, â€œhe feels like a babysitter when Iâ€™m having a mental breakdownâ€. (I experience Derealization/Depersonalization) this was the reason I would breakdown maybe once or twice a month because I was having a massive episode. 
I had told this to my therapist and she said that was not right for him to do. Time passes by we end our relationship on good terms and he apologizes for doing that to me and realizes it wasnâ€™t right to do that to me.

Now the present: I am currently with a new partner and it somehow popped into our conversation but I had let him know about this type of situation with my ex. And he told me that was really bad and that he felt bad that happened to me and that he would never do such thing. This started happening more recently and he has started doing the exact same thing.

"I have recurring major depressive disorder, and it's hit me again pretty hard. I've gone through it all before, and I've begun taking steps to drag myself back out of this again. I made appointments with my therapist, and have started working out. Naturally it has taken me ages to actually begin building myself back up again, and unfortunately it's taken too long.

I was planning on moving in to an apartment with my brother, but I was in between jobs when my depression started again. I haven't been motivated to do much of anything, and I kept putting off getting a job. He finally got fed up with me and found a different roommate.

It was just as I started picking up the pieces and putting my life back together. I'm absolutely devestated right now, as that was what was really keeping me going lately. I was really looking forward to it and now I'm just crushed.",depression_disorder
"Then he said that Iâ€™m always saying I donâ€™t have the time, but that I need to make the time.

I want to go so bad. Every day itâ€™s only getting harder. I live in filth, Iâ€™m alone, and when Iâ€™m not alone and with friends Iâ€™m just reminded of what a fucking burden I am to them. They tell me Iâ€™m not but then why to I feel like I am? Why do I feel like every breath I breathe is another breath wasted on my existence? Why does it hurt so fucking bad? 

Iâ€™m afraid to get on meds. My family is made up of addicts and pill heads. And I hardly have time to sleep and shower because the rest of my time is spent crying or being at work. But somehow Iâ€™m supposed to justâ€¦fix it. 

Fuck. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry. I want to fix it. I do. But itâ€™s not that easy. Itâ€™sâ€¦just not that easy. Why does everyone think itâ€™s that easy? 

If I could get on pills I could end all of this. So maybe heâ€™s right.

"You ever get a quarter of the way into some series that has like 100 seasons and you just kinda lose interest in watching it? 

It's really not a bad show, especially compared to some of the other ones, but it's getting repetitive and you're just not feeling it. You're pretty sure you already know how its gonna end and you have a good guess at the general plot arc. Sure, there will probably be a couple plot twists or whatever, but they might actually make it worse for the show's main character. Some people keep telling you that it gets better in the later seasons, but other people say you've already watched the best parts. Maybe the worst part is that you're not sure you want to keep watching the show even if it does get better. You keep watching and hoping it will pull you back in, but youâ€™ve felt the same way for a ton of episodes. You're just kinda done.

I'm asking because my mother recently cut me off and she was all I had for 23 years, but after the first ten minutes of feeling down after the phone call, I was fine. I was genuinely more upset with myself having that reaction than I was with the relationship coming to an end. I don't have any friends, never did, never will.

"Sorry if this is a bit unorganized. I am angry, frustrated, and unfocused. I simply need to type and vent.

Formally, I have been diagnosed with MDD, AvPD, SzPD. Psychologists and therapists have also stated that I may have OCD, GAD, ADHD, and ASD. (What is terrible is that so many of these share 90% of the same symptoms so who the fuck knows what I deal with)

Four therapists and years of medications, nothing has worked. Now, I am on my fifth therapist, and I hate her as much as the rest. 

It feels like I am being brainwashed, and she fights me on every little thing. If I disagree with her or am vague, it's instantly my unconscious fighting her. I am afraid of even saying that all of this makes me uncomfortable as it will simply be another sign of my unconscious not trusting the process.

She has also attacked my younger self at times. Belittling me about how much I must have not wanted to do something because I didn't fight like crazy for a certain grads. Like for fucks sake, I was 13 and a teacher completely belittled my attempts to bring up my grade, and now my therapist agrees that I was in the wrong because I didn't try harder. 

She refuses to focus on my actual problem -- executive dysfunction. I basically cannot do what I want to do. I am 28, and I literally have nothing to show for it. I have no skills, I graduated from a no-name college only due to cheating, I have no job because they make me suicidal, I have nothing. I cannot force myself to do a single thing. I will literally fucking face homelessness soon enough...

yet this ass is focusing on my social problems. Hell, I don't even have bad social problems. In fact, my social life is the best thing about my life. Don't get me wrong, I don't have dozens of friends, but I have an SO and several friends and good acquaintances. Sure I can be awkward, I can't feel my emotions and that can lead to some problems socially, and I don't get out that often to social events (I still do though).

But nah she tells me to trust the process. She says everything is relations, and if I better understand the therapeutic relationship and social relationships, I will learn...something I think...I actually have no clue. She simply says this is important, nothing about how my life is fucked if I don't learn ways to start doing.

If anything, her tone implies that I must be lying about my social relations and they are the real problem.

On top of that, she is now the second therapist to think I have autism. She keeps trying to teach me how normal people think and feel as if this is an important matter to me right now. Let alone the fact that this feels disgusting. I was called a freak for years, and her trying to cure me only makes me feel like I might actually be one. She is trying to morph me into some bubbly empath.

I am fucking sick of this, but I have no money. She is basically doing this for free, and she has a PhD. But it is not working like everything else. I have no idea what to do while my life wallows away.",depression_disorder

"Not sure whatâ€™s wrong with meâ€¦

In November of 2020 something changed inside me. I donâ€™t know how to explain it, but I just feel different. 



There was a period of 2-3 months where I could just barely get out of bed, felt anxious all the time, and was always profusely sweatingâ€¦



In 1 year I basically gave up on all my personal development and hobbies. 



I felt this was partially due to a bunch of things going on in my life and hating my job with a passion. However, I found a new job I truly like but honestly feel worse. 



I feel like I always have brain fog, have trouble focusing hard on any one thing, always tired, never have an appetite, etc. 

I also always have this pit in my stomach, a feeling that is difficult to describe but always lingers.



Sometimes between one week and the next I can have extreme high morale and then it can suddenly just drop so hard. But even when I am in a mood feeling relatively better, I can barely muster up the energy to do anything besides smoke weed, bum out and watch videos on my phone all day, or sleep â€” and obviously wake up for workâ€¦



Iâ€™m not sure if I have depression, anxiety, or maybe even ADHD. I just know I have some feelings of being super down that can be short term or quite long term at times, definitely feel nervous and anxious a lot of the time (even if my head is clear and Iâ€™m not aware of something on my mind, my body feels very physically stressed out anyways) and just really feel embarrassed of how Iâ€™ve changed in the last 2 years. I feel like a shell of my former self. 



Iâ€™ve never tried to end my life or anything like that, there was a period of time I engaged in highly risky activities which I knew could potentially result in death â€” without the goal of trying to die but being okay with the fact that it could totally happen. I do not do this anymore for sure. 



My days just all feel the same and like Iâ€™m not really doing anything outside of my 9-5.



I guess I just always kinda feel myself in a state of figuring out what to do with myself, and then never have the urge or motivation to put effort anythingâ€” then basically do nothing all day. 



Just want some insights from others. Thanks in advance.",depression_disorder

I have good friendships and bonds besides the bad apples that try to take advantage of my kindness every once and awhile. It hurts I fight with my girlfriend all the time and idk why.

"My life just isnâ€™t what I want it to beâ€”childhood to present-future. The windows of opportunity donâ€™t entirely feel wide open.

I feel like Iâ€™m getting too old to be optimistic about my life, even if Iâ€™m seemingly young. I donâ€™t have any friends, Iâ€™m not having regular sex, and the idea of living an unfulfilling life just does nothing for me: I only want the real life equivalent of the fantasy.

i *love* to feel depressed, its so *FUN* to just not want to exist anymore. ive felt this way since before i can remember. i mean i didnt know what killing myself was so i just knew i wanted to not be here in this world or anywhere for that matter. i just dont know anymore. i go from feeling numb to feeling everything. 

you ever get those moments of happiness but then immediately after just go back to feeling numb or depressed? its like i cant be happy without feeling that gaping hole in me. 

i called this a rabbit hole because i seem to always feel alone but when its really bad i write about it and then start feeling crazy because i just spiral. i start thinking about how life isnt real and its all fake, like me writing this could just be a simulation or something. i am sorry if i make no sense or if you completely relate and it triggers you.

anyway i just want to feel okay. i just hate myself. like i will probably delete reddit because i feel like i dont deserve help or need it cause i have everything i want and need in life. but depression makes it so hard. why cant everyone just feel okay?!

"Hi, this might be a long read so sorry, recently I've really been struggling with loneliness and I've struggled with depression since I was 10. Well I've been existentially lonely for years. But now I'm starting to wonder if I need help. Some background as to what's going on and where I'm at: I used to be a drug dealer. From bout 18 to 21 I sold mostly pot in an illegal state but not limited to bulk of xans, acid, some coke, e, Molly, ghb pretty much any party drug. I was an addict, mainly to dxm and oxy and alcohol. But I've been clean since 19. Clean of addiction as its a big part of why one of my best friends I ever had took his own life. I've had my stints of drug use and coke benders, but it's been awhile and does not weigh on my mind like it once did. Ive been able to keep a full time job at a dealership as a tech (post addiction) for about 4 years now despite this and the lack of sleep that comes with it. Well I met a woman at my old job in the city I used to live in. I was just turned 21 and she was 28 with two kids. We fell in love, I fell in love with her children and treated them as my own. Her son even called me daddy even though he saw his dad just as much as he saw me. I stopped trappin for her bc she didn't want it around the kids, of course. Well it didn't work out and looking back was a terrible and toxic relationship. But I'd never been so close and know someone so well. Naturally I was devastated it didn't work out even though the breakup was mutual. It left me very confused on who I could trust. Shed even tried to straight up fist fight me twice, I cldnt believe she wld hit me. It didnt physically bother me as she is a small lady and I've fought alot and don't mind to get hit. I just couldn't believe she would want to hurt me like that.. Well naturally I had a lapse after the relationship and said fuck it Imma make some money and started selling again. I fucked up, I got greedy. Started doin things the wrong way, getting into the wrong circles. one night June 23rd of last year 4 motherfuckers kicked in my front door to rob me. They took everything I had and put me in the hospital. An hour later they went and killed my friend up the street. I almost was charged with 5 felonies that night aswell due to what the robbers didn't even take (scale with coke residue, several zips of pot wrapped individually, thankfully no money left tho) but the cops didn't charge me just called me an ambulance. It's all still sitting in an evidence locker tho but it's been 8 months and I've moved several several counties over so whatever ig. That night I ditched my apartment to stay with friends. I was getting paranoid, and mind you I've been held at gun point plenty of times but this time was different. This time it scared me because my cousin was murdered at 21 and I was nearly murdered at 22. It rocked the family and I cldnt help to think what if the kids were there? What if I hadnt been fuckin up and did what I supposed to do and stay ready. If they hadn't caught me sleepin they would have never made it to my friend's house and never killed him... So I skipped town to start over. Once again. And I had to delete most my ""friends"" because I cldnt trust most of em as I had to have known who robbed me or who told them to rob me and my friend.
Now it draws near the 4th anniversary of my friends suicide and it's all coming down on me. I don't sleep anymore. Not really. I wake up with my adrenaline pumping more and more. This used to happen sometimes too but my ex was always in the bed with me there for me so at least I CLD go back to sleep or I toss and turn toss and turn. Now it happens several times a week and I can't go back. Now I live in a town where I know no one. I've tried dating apps and the like to meet people but it's not for me I can't play their games. I don't go out really anymore. I don't know what to do with myself bc I've never done anything but try to make money with my free time. I've started working on my health and am doing well with it, eating right and working out. I don't do the things I used to do I don't enjoy much of anything I used to enjoy doing. I'm so lonely and I don't know what to do but I'm worried I may do something to put me in prison. Now I'm 23, struggling, pretty much broke, and I don't know what to do. I need someone to touch me and tell me its okay and that I can make it and live a normal life. Ive only ever wanted a normal life. Have you ever felt completely broken yet so ready to fight and grind? I'm confused everytime I think I'm getting better I get rejected by someone or some opportunity and tail spin into my past.",depression_disorder
"I turned 18 at the end of last year, and later this year I'll be going to uni. But up until this point it feels like I've done nothing meaningful at all. I've never been in a relationship (or even close to being in one) I never have plans with anyone, I barely talk to anyone. I wake up feeling miserable, reluctantly go to college (although some days I just skip and sleep for most the day) then I come home, waste time doing nothing, sleep, and redo this process.

Compared to other people my age I feel like I've experienced so much less in life. It just feels so shitty to know that I can't regain this time which I've spent doing nothing and that I have missed out on so much. 

Knowing you can't regain something you missed out on, when it was so important, is such a horrible feeling, and all because of social anxiety and these terrible thoughts I have.",depression_disorder

"Not 100% depression-related, but it still hast to do with self-esteem and happiness. I just need some comfort, some good words.

I donâ€˜t know who I am anymore. Iâ€˜m just losing my personality, my identity.

Iâ€˜m currently spending most of my time at home, with my family. Iâ€˜ve noticed that I tend to agree with their views and opinions. Iâ€˜m far too impressionable. And the same thing happens when Iâ€˜m with other people.

I just pick a certain side simply to get along and feel included. I think thatâ€˜s the main reason why I am so impressionable. I have zero self-confidence, I always question my decisions and I need both validation and acceptance. Or maybe I'm just stupid, or coward.

Now I have to make an important decision. My family wouldn't want me to do it. Yet they say I'm free to make my own choice. Iâ€™m even 18+ years old so I ought to choose freely. But I canâ€™t, I eventually ignore this decision since thatâ€™s what they want to. I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s because Iâ€™m fearful of their judgment, or because I want to feel more accepted.

And Iâ€™m sure that if my family wanted me instead to make this decision and I didnâ€™t want to, then I would end up doing it because of the same reason. And not just my family, but someone else too (for instance a group of friends).

I have no idea at all and Iâ€™m really tired of this. Iâ€™m a true coward. Iâ€™m stupid. Iâ€™d love to make that decision on my own, but Iâ€™m unable to do so. I feel paralyzed and I also feel like Iâ€™m losing my own identity. I donâ€™t know what I really want anymore. I don't know if I have to blame myself, people who surround me, or whatever. I just donâ€™t know, I feel so confused and tired.",depression_disorder
"This is not the first time as about a month ago when I had the same thought. I attempted suicide, ended up in hospital, and the doc removed one antidepressant and reduced the dose of the other.  


I don't believe in medicine anymore which I told the doc before but at that time I was warded and couldn't escape so yeah. I told him to change the medicine but he just reduced dose. I've only taken antidpepressants since May 2021.   


I'm also considering stopping antipsychotic. These thoughts are also supported by well just disillusion and I don't think I am wrong to believe that the world is disgusting and all I see is rubbish. Control of state, corporate greed, mindless consumerism, endless work and for what.

"Man, seeing myself out in public is just so crippling. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s the sole reason but after going out with a couple friends, who are much more attractive than me, last night I have been bed bound all day.

I had planned to go for a jog, something that would hopefully make me feel better about my self image, but I havenâ€™t had the energy. I have genuinely just lay on my bed all day and eaten chocolate I was gifted for Christmas which had made me feel even worse.

Itâ€™s awful, why do these things affect us so much? I find it borderline insulting when people give me compliments on my appearance. Like they are taking the piss? One of my closest friends told me he liked my moustache the other day and it suited me and I feel so self conscious itâ€™s unreal.

"So like many here the depression comes and goes. Itâ€™s been gone for a while because Iâ€™ve had some bright people introduced to my life and things have been good until today. This is the first day in a while Iâ€™ve felt like a waste of oxygen. I wonâ€™t really go into details, but I feel like I let some people down today that are really important to me. I feel like if I try to fix it in the ways that it can be â€œfixedâ€ it is going to seem patronizing and pandering. I just want them to know they are more important than what the issue was (essentially me getting recognized for something at work that was a team effort. Even though I shared the acknowledgement and spotlight with them, the â€œrewardâ€ isnâ€™t something I could share if I wanted to so Iâ€™m likely just going to decline it altogether. If my coworkers and I canâ€™t share the reward Iâ€™d rather not have it). This seems really trivial now that Iâ€™ve typed it all out, but I just really hate myself right now because I just like to enrich peoples lives - help them achieve their goals, make them laughâ€¦ help however I can.

The exams which are most important to me, I have failed in all of them and the last two which are left. I have just realised that I did not complete my registration for the exam.  Nothing is left now. To all those who think I'm stupid yes I am and this is the reason I'm going now. I have disappointed my parents a burden would lose when they would be gone.

"I'm only 19 years old, I feel like i struggled with depression my whole life but I only realized it a while ago when the quarantine started. i've always been a very quiet and lonely kid, i've spent most of my life inside my house playing videogames or in the Internet. I always had a very low self esteem in terms of thinking I'm ugly and noone can be attracted to, not only because of my looks, a lot of people told me that I'm good looking or at least ""decent looking"" but I dont feel like that, I have a sunken chest, its not that bad it doesnt affect my health but I dont like how it looks so i never take my shirt off, even my best friends dont know that, besides i feel like a boring person, dont really talk much and sometimes it feels like people dont want to hang out with me because of that, everytime I'm with a friend there has to be someone else that draws attention of me.

The worst part is that i feel like i don't deserve being depressed, i've always had an easy life, never really had to worry that much about anything, when i was 2 or 3 years old my fathers divorced and left home with my mother, that was probably the only time in my life where we had money issues, my mom worked a lot and did everything so we could live as best as possible and i Will forever be grateful with her for those things, but She was working most of the time and i was left alone in my house or when i was younger someone would come to take care of me for a while. I started living with my father when i turned 13 mostly for convenience, he lived just a few blocks away from my school and i had my playstation there, he's always been relatively wealthy but he never really cared about being a good father, he provided to the house but he never taught me anything, never asked me how i felt and i feel like he's always being ashamed of who i am, everytime we have discussions he says so many bad things to me, making me feel ashamed like I'm not good enough for him. I don't have a job and i dont want to work but I have to if i want to get money and live alone and that fucks me up, it's like im just not made for living and i dont know what to do, i've been thinking lately of ending it all, I know I'm weak. my dream is to have a rock band and live with my music but I don't know if I'm good enough for that.

"I have a best friend, she is amazing, nice, clever, supportive. We met at university and never stopped talking since we finished our undergraduate studies. 

She's also my only friend, all the others have left, or they weren't real friends, more like acquaintances. She knows absolutely everything about me, tell me every single things happening to her, I never feel ill-at-ease around her. We can meet, but also not see each others for months, we never drive away. 

But things changed two years ago. She got a bit weird. I knew she had depression and a tendency to self-harm, however this was different. She didn't sleep for days but was full of energy. She went to meet a guy she was talking to online. To be short, he wasn't in love with her, which triggered the biggest outburst she ever had. Several months later, she was hospitalized and diagnosed with a bipolar disorder.

Since then, I've witnessed her suffering from violent mood swings. For months she's euphoric, almost hysterical, unable to sleep, she doesn't feel hunger, she runs everywhere, bites her tongue, self-harm, falls in love many times, sleeps with dudes with no protection, drinks. 

After that there is the depressive episode where she can't leave her bed, has no energy to talk, wants to die, hates herself, sleeps all day. 

She is monitored by a psychiatrist and a psychologist, she takes a lot of medicine, but things aren't getting better. She's unable to attend her studies, to read, to draw, all things she used to love. 

I don't recognize her anymore, I feel like she is slipping away. 

I know this is an illness you don't just recover from. But months after months, she still has no control of herself. All the failures are really hard to stand. I see how her episodes scare her. 

The worst part is, it makes her suicidal. She already attempted to die from an overdose. I do my best to help. I talk to her for hours, I accompany her at parties, I listen, I try to dissuade her from sleeping with men she just met... But it's not enough. 

I feel powerless, sad, stressed. I'm terrified I might lose her. Whenever she doesn't respond to my texts for hours, I'm scared her brother might tell me she's dead.

To be honest I just can't stand this feeling of loneliness anymore and it just seems to be getting worse for me, some days I just wouldn't want to get out of my bed and I fucking cry every single day. I just hate my life not only because she decided not to stay with me but because I hate my body and the way people see me. Sometimes I just wish I wasn't born.",depression_disorder

And I am just as much to blame for it all. People say that only you can determine how others make you feel, and maybe itâ€™s true. I let people walk all over me. I was good, kind, loyal, loving, forgiving, supportive. I was present. I was dedicated. I was committed.

"I have recently started feeling like nothing in my life is going well and I am constantly feeling sorry for myself. I donâ€™t like feeling this way but I feel like I canâ€™t help but feel like this.

Small things that happen throughout the day end up making me feel really angry and then after I feel a wave of sadness. My reactions are way over the top with small inconveniences but when they happen, it feels like everything is against me. 

Iâ€™m constantly tired and I always feel lost and bored with my current life. This has gotten progressively worse over the last few months and I am starting to feel overwhelmed. Does this sound like the initial stage of depression ? 

Iâ€™m not suicidal or anything but just constantly down about everything â˜¹ï¸",depression_disorder
"Iâ€™m so tired of being depressed. Iâ€™ve gotten so good at masking that sometimes it feels like maybe Iâ€™m not actually depressed. But then I sit down alone and it all comes flooding back. I donâ€™t know how to be vulnerable or ask for help from parents because Iâ€™m 1. embarrassed 2. Angry at them for ignoring all of my cries for help my whole life. (Told one of my friends I wanted to kms in high school and he told my parents. They sat me down to ask me if it was true and I said no because I got embarrassed. My dad said â€œI wouldnâ€™t know what to do with myself if you ever did that.â€ Then we all just went to bed. Never spoke about it again even though I live a very obviously depressed lifeâ€¦ tendency to isolate, no motivation to complete daily tasks and never cared about school or hobbies other than one thing I would be obsessed with in the moment because it was my only source of joy, was vocal about how I liked sad books and my dad said â€œwhy? So you donâ€™t feel as bad about your life?â€ I said yes and we laughed. He meant it as a joke because thatâ€™s our relationship, but it hurts that they never realized humor was a coping mechanism of mine even after hearing rumors I had suicidal ideation). 

I donâ€™t mean to make my parents sound careless because they do so much for me and always support me. And I know if they knew what was going on they would feel awful, but I honestly just donâ€™t want them to because 1. itâ€™s awkward and 2. theyâ€™d just make it about themselves and try to fix it for me instead of just letting me do the work to get better. And Iâ€™m lucky to have that, but itâ€™s not what I need. Theyâ€™re not flawless by any means but I feel guilty complaining about them because I know they couldâ€™ve been so much worse and that they genuinely try their best but just werenâ€™t raised to be emotionally mature. Both had pretty intense upbringings. 

Anyways, Iâ€™m 22 now and still struggle with depression (I also have ADHD so I know there are factors from that that contribute to feeling this way). I feel like I seem like someone thatâ€™s happy and has it figured out. I have a good job (even though my depression has enabled horrible spending habits so I donâ€™t really live inside my means at the moment, but thatâ€™s something Iâ€™m actively working on), I have my own apartment, a dog, and a family that I know loves me unconditionally. So to people in my life I seem to have it together. But I donâ€™t come across this way because Iâ€™ve actually become happier. If anything I am a much more cynical, sad person now â€¦ Iâ€™ve just been masking for so long that I donâ€™t know how to be real anymore and I have a hard time even telling whatâ€™s real or fake within myself. I feel super uncomfortable talking to my parents about mental health and I have a therapist now that I am working with, but I just have no other support system because I donâ€™t have many friends where I live and the friends I do have from my hometown and collegeâ€¦ I honestly just donâ€™t like that much so I donâ€™t want to get closer to them because they only really get along with my masked versionâ€¦ and I hate that version of me so itâ€™s hard to like people that it attracts. 

I guess Iâ€™m just in need of some support. How can I move on with my life and become a real human? Tired of walking around with this mask but donâ€™t have people I feel comfortable taking it off in front ofâ€¦ and quite frankly I donâ€™t even know who I am without it. Itâ€™s led me to intense hyper independence and I just am incapable of trusting anyone to confide in â€¦ and even if I could I donâ€™t know how I would talk to them because I donâ€™t even understand my feelings myself. 

How do I take off this mask and keep it off even in the presence of others? Without trauma dumping everything Iâ€™ve bottled up for the past 10 years? I have my therapist but can only afford to see her once a week right now as I try to make up for my over spending for the last 8 months. And even then when I meet with her I try to focus on the stuff I can do to improve my life and feel better rather than dwelling on the pain of my past.

"I have self-sabotaged every good opportunity in my life. I left a top-ranked university in my junior year because of mismanaging my finances and a lack of encouragement from my mother. She would repeatedly call me and tell me to come back home. 

I have never filed taxes before, and Iâ€™m thousands of dollars in debt. I could blame my parents for setting poor examples for me in life, but itâ€™s really my fault. I repeatedly made poor decisions. 

I think my downward spiral started when I lost my faith after a fellow student mocked me for being a Christian. I went on to read every major atheist text at the time. I became a nihilist and convinced myself the decisions now wouldnâ€™t matter in the future, because we all end up dead anyway. 

When I went home after college, I got caught up in working sales job and falling for the wrong guy. My brother would ask me to help him enroll in college, but I would procrastinate. Then, Iâ€™m not sure if out of boredom or peer pressure, he tried a drug with a cousin. My brother had a mental break, and subsequently spent years in and out of jail and mental institutions. He lives at home with my mother and spends most of his days sleeping on the couch due to medication. Because of his background, no one will hire him. I fucking hate myself for failing him. 

Now, Iâ€™m going on 32, and Iâ€™m a failure. I feel like a ball of wasted potential, and I donâ€™t know how to recover. I never imagined a future without a college degree.

"To be clear this is happening right now, I am sat in my room enduring extremely loud music from the next room (parallel to my own) where two grown men smoke inside the house and drink beers until when? This is my little brother, and my Dad used to do the same thing when I was a kid.

If I ask him to stop, it will be pointless, because I know the first thing he says will either be, ""I've just got my mate over for tonight"" or ""You always play loud music"" (Very rarely by the way, just the fact that I have before, I write music occasionally).

The worst part is, if I were to do something more aggressive like disconnecting his phone from the Wi-Fi, he will know that I did it, or if I turn the music off myself, he will threaten me. In the past he has put several holes in the walls around the house, and punched through entire doors. He broke the lock on my own door and put a hole in it too, he's threatened to stab people if I don't give him my bank card. He tries to push drugs on me all the time (sometimes I am forced to smoke weed with him) and constantly asks me for money which I now don't even keep in my own bank account. 

I can't afford to move out and have had no luck with jobs for the past year or so. I honestly want to just fucking move, not end my life, but just fucking move away from my shit family.

My family is the kind that have never done things outside of the norm, they are people that live in the past or something. I have to help them with every single tech problem they have, they will ask me what their passwords are and get frustrated when I say ""I don't know??"". 

My older brother who is considered a local legend is also a massive bigot and it's very painful, he is the type that insists ""family is family and we all help each other out till the end"", like fuck off, we barely know each other. He implied to me the other night that gay people are just ' weak ' and that anyone with mental illness is just making it up based on info from the web, he says that transgender isn't a real thing and seemed disgusted when I told him that some men shave their body hairs. 

Like I am finally getting comfortable with my sexuality at 28 years old, and am realizing what I want in a relationship and for my future, but when I talk to my family I start to doubt that I am doing the right thing and it makes me confused. Instead of being a supportive system like how an ideal family would be they just say things like ""It would hurt me if you one day decided you were a woman"", and that it's just rebellious to be gay.

Hmm what the fuck am I gonna do, please justify for me that there is nothing wrong with being gay and finding clothes of the opposite gender more appealing... I seriously need some support right now... literally no one I know seems to accept what I am into... Unless they are gamer friends but I don't talk to them about this stuff...",depression_disorder
Depression never leaves you. Everyone else leaves you but not depression. Every single day. Every single thing I do feels like a chore. I just want to be normal. I just want it to all go away. I don't have words to explain how I feel right now. There's just no end. There's no light at the end of the tunnel. There's just nothing. It's empty. I feel empty.

Iâ€™ve been in a pretty rough patch for the past 5 months and have had the worst mental health Iâ€™ve ever had in my whole life. Iâ€™m only 19 and Iâ€™m going off the college but thoughts of killing myself are becoming a constant. I literally just start thinking about it and the ways I would do it. Iâ€™ll think about how great it will be not the exist and how easy it is for me to kill myself but I always catch myself and tell myself that I would never do it. At times I feel pretty indifferent and say I would rather be dead because the thought of living the rest of my life doesnâ€™t sound appealing at all. Like I literally saw a pond yesterday when I was at a park with my family and my first thought was if I could drown myself in it. I used to never have these thoughts but it seems Iâ€™m having them more and more often. Iâ€™m super young and got allot going for me and I just wanna know how I can stop going down this path because with every passing day the thoughts are becoming more enticing.,depression_disorder
"Hi my name is kaden and I just need a friend. No one likes me because I'm different and everyone bullies me. I'm just done, the only people I have is my family but I need actual people I can talk to that isn't my family.

"I have nothing to look forward to, there's nothing I want.   
I feel hopelessly stuck  
Also feel kind of lonely which is a new one, usually i'm pretty content to stay alone.     

My friends and I barely see each other and that's unlikely to change  
I fear for the future, we're all getting older and sicker.  

----------------------------   

The likelyhood of me ever actually owning a place for myself is practically nil.
Anywhere I rent would bleed me dry even if I managed to get the highest paying job i'm qualified for(fat chance due to some gaps in the cv and being shit at interviews)  

Had an extremely dispiriting experience with a recruitment agency recently, dozens of phone interviews and emails with 3 different people and **got** the job after a week of them going back and forth on if I had it or not.  
During this time they refused to give any kind of start date and when I suggested one that was convenient for me they scolded me for ""making demands"" and slyly implied they'd rescind my application.  
  
The only emails I received after the training to work from home was from somebody else who had trained in the same video conference asking if I had a start date yet as she hadn't received one, I hadn't either.   
Then one more from the recruitment agency confirming our start was the following day at 9.   

Instead of starting I was asked via phonecall at my starting time why I hadn't responded to work emails that hadn't shown up on their laptop and apparently were asking me to do a couple assignments *before* working officially for them.   

After the 3 month contract is over my circumstances wouldn't have really be any different.   
They paid just over double my unemployment pay for 40 hours a week and were so splattershot and unprofessional that they likely did me a favor.    

But fuck me I was already in a bad headspace and they throw this into the mix?  
Checked their google reviews after, if I had before i'd have known this was a regular thing with them and stayed clear.   

-----------------------   

My little sister has downsyndrome and her behavior is just getting worse and worse and I have no idea how to change that.   
I think(well, hope) that she'd stop if she knew how soulsucking and infuriating it is to put up with for years(with no end in sight)   

But any attempts to communicate that or reason with her have just become part of the ""play"" for her.   
She's also recently gotten aggressive enough that i'm glad that she seems to have stopped growing at a height shorter than my Mum(who has multiple sclerosis and in spite of some miracle of modern medicine restoring her from being almost unable to walk I still worry about a lot)   

--------------------------------   

If things start looking bad health-wise for Mum again in the future then i'll likely be looking after two people on my own, incidentally unsure how i'd support them exactly.   
I assume i'd sign up for the same caretakers/rent allowances as Mum has now and things would mostly be the same
Except with my crippling fear of driving[which is also unlikely to change] i'd just need to plan more deliveries?

That's also assuming my own health holds out, at this rate i'll drop dead soon enough anyway  
Slight exaggeration but i'm in pretty bad shape here.  
I'm slowly starting to salvage that even if it means limiting my comfort foods and booze  
(aka the only things that kinda keep me going)  

---------------------    

I stopped dating in my early twenties because I realised I just never developed any strong feelings for people so it felt like I was using them/wasting their time(and mine too I guess although that was the point) and that i'm basically asexual or extremely low libido.  

I also don't really like kids and after seeing and hearing about how terrible some parents are i've no illusions that that'll magically change by having my own so I don't have that as a reason to stay strong.  
Even before the realization that i'd be an emotionally absent father at best I was close to 100% sure that I don't want kids.   

----------------------------    

I'm not really looking for solutions right now and I don't think there really is any.  

Even if  
-I got a massive windfall of money so that getting a job and a place to myself would be no problem   
-Mum and Sis remain perfectly healthy so I wouldn't have to worry about them   
- I had regular contact with friends and close family like once or twice a week   

I'd still be full of apathy, boredom and anhedonia.   
At my core i'm a pretty pessimistic and miserable person and at 31 have been as long as I can recall.   

I guess what i'm saying is i'm not actively suicidal(anymore) but I don't really see any reasons to live.    
Other than fear of dying or hurting loved ones of course.   
-Mr Happy.

"My mom got cancer this year. And as shitty as it feels to say this, my first thought was, â€œI wish it was me, she is so lucky.â€ No worries now, she is doing well (Thyroid Cancer-got it fully removed). Itâ€™s just the feeling when you hear about someone getting cancer, you think of the worstâ€”itâ€™s terminal. I think theyâ€™re the lucky ones because their illness will kill them. 

Yet, with depression, itâ€™s not terminal. Itâ€™s â€œgo to therapyâ€, â€œitâ€™ll get betterâ€, â€œhang in there, you can beat this.â€ Itâ€™s the thought that if you commit suicide, you gave up-there was something you couldâ€™ve done.

"I have absolutely no desire to end my life or commit suicide, but at the same time, I don't think I would even mind that much if some kind of apocalyptic event were to occur and ended all life on Earth. I think it's just because me committing suicide would be too small and wouldn't change anything, but an apocalypse would be giving this entire hellhole planet and all the fucked up systems and societies on it what it finally deserves.

That's the thing, really. The thought of suicide is sad and scary because you're the only one who dies while everyone else keeps on living. Why should I be the one to pay the price for my life problems when so much of them stem from society's fault? But there's something oddly egalitarian about the thought of an apocalypse.

Instead I'll resort to distractions. Games, in my case. They're pretty good at killing time. A few days ago I got rid of them as well.

The result? Nothing. I've sunk further into depression and loneliness. All those thoughts that those games had kept away are back.

"Hello,

Iâ€™m 26 and have been constantly depressed about working a 9-5 job/40 hour work week for the past few years. Iâ€™ve been working full time, and job hopping since I was 15.

Every single day I wake up knowing that I will give away 8 hours of my life for just enough money to survive at the end of every 2 weeks. Even on my days off Iâ€™m constantly thinking about how my day needs to be so structured so that I can get my 7-8 hours of sleep, while doing all of my errands in a timely manner, so Iâ€™m basically rushing through my days off.

Let me clarify, I donâ€™t mind my job itself. I bake cookies and itâ€™s so easy a monkey could do it. What Iâ€™m constantly stressing over is the fact that I HAVE to give most of my day up to survive, for probably the rest of my life.

So my question is, will anti depressants help me be desensitized to this feeling? I want to go into work everyday 10 minutes early, and be happy and talkative like my coworkers, and to make management happy by being a good worker and getting sales to where they want. I hate doing all of these things, but Iâ€™d rather feel like a mindless robot than be depressed like this.

I just want to feel happy, I want to get excited, I want to find joy in things again.  Instead I feelâ€¦ dull.  Empty.  Like I donâ€™t belong anywhere, like Iâ€™m always alone in a room full of people.  And I have no one to talk to about it besides my therapist.  I donâ€™t want to bother anyone or drag them down with me, I wouldnâ€™t wish this feeling on anyone.  Iâ€™m just so tired.  

I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m asking for help or just venting.  I just want someone to understand, yâ€™know?  Sorry for the long rant.",depression_disorder
"Hi, Iâ€™ve been battling depression for about 4 years now and even though itâ€™s getting better (on and off with meds and therapy help) I canâ€™t bring myself to work on hobbies I used to love.

For example, I used to paint all of the time and anytime I try now, I enjoy it in the moment but making myself start is the hard thing and instead waste time sleeping or mindless phone scrolling. I miss having passion for my hobbies..

Does anyone have advice that has experienced this? How do you get yourself to feel like doing things for fun again?",depression_disorder

There's someone I has but I didn't cherish so she left me and doesn't want to be with me anymore. It has been so many months and I still miss her. Nobody could ever feel this gap in me.

"Hello, thanks for listening. Im so depressed after so many losses. I have regret and am tortured by so many mistakes. These mistakes could have been undone until some if my family passed away, cementing the past and unable to improve the future. I just cant hardly live with myself. To make matters worse, I quit my job, lost all kinds of money, live in a house that the roof is leaking everywhere, moldy. I got my cats in my house also, and they went through a ton of misery that makes me miserable. I was wanting a better place to live where my cats could run free. I caused me, my dad, and dogs to miss out on vacations, camping trips, all kinds of fun stuff while I was trying to work and make money so I could do that. Now I cant undo the pain.

My doc said I had anxiety in september and dismissed everything when I refused to take anti depressants. I took anti depressants and sleep meds back in august when I was having trouble sleeping, and then became depressed after. The way I was before the meds and after is shocking difference. And I determined I was not going to take anymore antidepressants. I dont like the therapy either, I hate the feelings chat and hashing out my troubles. I know exactly why I feel the way I do, and talking cant undo it. 

I'm lonely, 40 yrs old, male (just so you get a better picture of who I am). I am tortured by the grief, regret, misery. I was fine and happy before the death. Now I just cant hardly live with myself, it's been 7 months. I used to chat online, but nobody wants to hear me. Reddit boards here is one of the only boards j can find to post on. The world is so crazy and screwed up. I just watch everyone do what I never got a chance to do and now cant, and it rips me to pieces. My level of depression is severe, I have no interest in anything anymore, just living day by day. My savings are getting slim without work. But it makes my blood boil and frustration to think about the long hours and work.

I am shakey and fatigued, like when you hold up a weight too long and your muscles start shaking from strain. I get that all day and night now. I dont know if it's from something or just stress related. I was just lonely here and tired of everything. Let me hear from you all, as I feel like I'm completely alone in this world.",depression_disorder
"Although I was prescribed an antidepressant by my doctor, I still do not feel like I am legitimately diagnosed with depression.  I am going make an appointment with a therapist to see if they can diagnose me.  But in my time since being prescribed the meds I have been doing research and I think I figured it out.  I check almost all of the boxes for Dysthymia or PDD.  Actually feeling like I have a sense of what I am dealing with makes me feel a little bit better.  I have been dealing with this for so long I don't even know when the depression started.  But I have been able to fake my way through life for at least the better part of a decade.  I am so tired of this internal battle.  I want to feel better.

"This is not aimed at myself or any one who is considering suicide. It's aimed at people  who literally boost their ego, build their ego on the humiliation of others. I'm 18 and have been recovering from depression for a while now and so far so good, but the last few weeks have been tough. I'm fed up of being single. It's not a central fixation to me like it once was but it is a little frustrating. It's so emotionally draining using dating apps and constantly getting nowhere, and its even more vexxing when people tell me i'm good looking so that surely can't be the issue. Anyway, since september I've been in a group chat with some people from my old school who I don't really consider proper friends but more the kind just to laugh with online. We often joke around at each other. They're quite immature in all honesty, but I guess I was kind of flattered initally to be in a group with people I considerd to be ""Popular"", whatever *that* even means. We were rating ourselves and others out of 10 and like someone would rate me 2/10 or whatever, I rated this guy 1.5/10. Like that he flipped, literally not even joking, says  im the ""laughing stock"" fo the group, makes fun of my appearance, what I wear, I call him a cunt and he says if hes a cunt im the nearest i've ever got to one. Even makes fun of stuff that literally isn't even in my control, like saying i ""didnt even last a month in university"" (i literally got so ill with pneumonia i had to be admitted to the emergency department). Makes fun of the fact my only job right now is delivering pizza (its a part time job ffs) . i just say this, and I advise you to ask anyone else this who is giving you grief:

&amp;#x200B;

""What have you genuinely ever done in your life that you are proud of?""

And surprise surprise.

He couldn't answer.

I've battled depression every day for god knows how many years in all honesty. anxiety before that. I have done battle, every single day for the last five or so years, be it with bullies on the playground or demons in my head. I stood on the edge of life and death, and chose life, even though it got far worse before it got better. I stand up for people, the other day (again it has been a bad few weeks) I literally put my own safety and to be honest probably my life in danger by standing up to someone who was raically abusing someone in the street, and got threatened myself. I have self respect now. I don't take shit from no one. If it wasnt for the fact I'm applying for a job where it won't exaclty look good if I assault people, I probably wouldn't mind knocking him about a bit. Not that I need to. He's already lost a friend over it, some guy in the group told me how outrageous he was and how he wont be friends with im anymore. 

It did hurt, a lot to be honset, because I'm already sensitive about the things he touched on at a time where I'm strugglign to understand why I'm still single. The stuff he said might have driven myself a few months ago to suicide. Or someone else.  People like him...*theyre* the ones who don't deserve to be alive, not us. I know the type. I've dealt with them many times before. They all give it large and when someone gives it back to them at their expense they throw a tantrum. He literlaly tried to gaslight me into thinking that it was me who couldn't take it, but I'm sorry he knew a bit about my background and anyone with any kind of decency wouldn't say that especially to someone in my position. I hate people like that. They seem to have everything in life given to them. He tells me hes more of a man than me because hes slept with more women. Well sorry what a pathetic judgement of character. I'm teh one who'se literally battled a mental illness every day for years, and stands up for whats right and wrong.

"This morning, it hit me. All at once, so suddenly:

My fuck ups. My mistakes. My lifelong emotional trauma. My negative core beliefs.

I slowly walked upstairs to my shower. *itâ€™s odd that showering is a chore, isnâ€™t it?* I turned the water as hot as it could go, because I wanted to feel pain. I wanted to punish myself for being so unlovable, for being so wrong about everything all the time, and for even existing. I wanted to feel pain, but Iâ€™m too damn weak to even do it a more dangerous way. Iâ€™m so damn weak that it was added to the list of what Iâ€™m punishing myself for. 

I sat down in the shower. My legs folded under me like a piece of paper, while I just let the water burn my skin. It hurt so badly, but itâ€™s what I deserved: pain. I bawled my eyes out until my eyes physically hurt and I could barely see. Why am I like this? What did I do to deserve to feel this way? Why am I so incapable of love?

The shower filled up with water after sitting there for 40 minutes. At that point, I began to wonder if it were the water from the shower, or my painful, soul-piercing tears.",depression_disorder
"Hello i am (20 M) live i a constant grief of my actions in the past. To be excactly since i was 13. I always had a bad side, but i learned and got i under control nowadays. But i cant forget that one thing i did. 

I was on Vacation with my family and we went 500km to visits our relatives. There the time as always nice. A House on the Countryside, where you just enjoyed peace. We made our own food, ate outside during summer, and played games. There where also good areas to play and explore as a kid. The best was always an outdoor hottub that was just pure joy. 

For me it fell apart when one evening my hormones took me over and i harassed my cousin unter the water. touched her when she was 10. At the time i just tought wow this feels good. And now im just ashamed and cant even recognize myself. Touching someone that didnt understood what was going on? how i said i just feel shame. Today she is a boy. Im just so confused and guilty that it could be my fault for destroying her life.

After that i grew distance with my family, visited less until today i dont even see or talk on the phone with them. It feels like a mindgame that just torments me from the inside. Yet i will not talk to my family about this. I just wanna leave it all behind. And try the best to make the world a better place. I dont deserve family.",depression_disorder

I just wish there was some sort of explanation, even if itâ€™s just that Iâ€™m not needed anymore or whatever role I filled in their life is now filled by someone else.

 Hi,

  
Writing yesterday felt good. Typing the words hurt, but there was also some sort of release there.. So I should carry it on (or at least I think?).

  
I woke up this morning with a headache that can be compared to being hit with a brick. I always get this same headache after I've had a really shit day and the stranger takes over. Its like the stranger just leaves a little reminder that she's still within me but not in full control on this day. Basically, I've taken a hit and lost some HP points due to her presence and control from yesterday. Today I feel good. Well, better. I look like shit, these hits sure do take a toll on my physical being but I have eaten and drank something other than coffee and this is a win. A win is a win, I will take what I can get.

  
Having a stranger living with you is one of the most powerless feelings you could probably feel or least it is to me. Having a constant switch between the person you know as yourself to a stranger you despise and can't be around is exhausting. ''What could the trigger be today? '' ''Why would that be a trigger? '' ''Do I even have triggers or is this just me now? '' These questions fly around my dark clouded mind everyday almost all day.I'm walking on egg shells because of myself. I need to protect myself from the stranger lurking in my mind and feeding off of my guilt, traumas, shame and hurt. I've never been a big Harry Potter fan, but it feels like those Dementors just sucking the fucking life out of you, but I am just a simple Muggle with a twig in my hand to fight it off. It's a battle that I am not yet fully equipped to fight, but I'm right in the middle of it calling for back up and I can see the troops on the horizon approaching at a snails pace. And here's that small piece of hope I said that I hated so much on 29.12.2021; They are still approaching. This is hope.  
Having hope when you feel so confused, spilt and hurt within yourself, is a hard thing to have. Dangerous. It keeps you going but you still keep getting let down. I, give me hope and then I also disappoint myself. It's a circle that I cannot break yet. Over time the feeling of hope has faded, but on certain days it is stronger than it has ever been.. What the actual fuck am I supposed to do with the emotions that are constantly contradicting and fighting against each other? One same emotion can bring me so much joy one day and destroy me the next. Come on, give me a break. I don't want to also feel fear and uncertainty when I am suppose to feel a comforting (and happy) feeling due to ''hope''.Is my brain programming itself for that emotion? Can I unlearn, and relearn and ''false'' way to feel an emotion? To be honest, my brain feels like a minefield and I wouldn't be surprised if there was some scientific evidence that we can do that to ourselves. For me, I want to know and understand why and where this comes from. What the root is. The only logical thing I can think is that my brain is doing this to protect me.Â   
Or maybe its the stranger. She's stealing it from me. She wants all that could make me feel good and human. Maybe my hope is too strong and scares her and therefore this is her point of attack. Fucking smart move stranger.Â   
I don't want to think too deep in the way that the stranger is taking it from as I feel that's welcoming her with open arms to do the damage I am scared she would do. Apparently I'm a good host. Maybe I should become a bitch to her and take my hope and slam the door in her face. That'll show her. Until the next time she takes over at least.. Because I know that there will be a next time. At this moment, I need to keep that in mind, to be safe and not shocked when she does take over. She will get weaker, those troops are on the hill. If they could just pick up the pace in time.  
Until maybe next time, please keep going, I don't want to lose you completely yet.  
From (what feel like) the real youÂ Â ",depression_disorder

I used to talk to this guy every single day and I considered him one of my favorites, we used to play games together and thanks to him I know a lot of songs that I'm interested, but lately he has been a ghost on the gaming app and I've noticed back then he always would add people and unfriend them after awhile, he unfriended everyone but ME, whenever I got online he would wait for me to play and constantly even bug me, but I loved that because to me it meant he was loyal and bugging me constantly meant he liked my company 

He stopped playing on the gaming app but we had each others Instagram, he kept me there for months but today for the first time I did kind of a face reveal since I never had posts or stories, I'm travelling so I took a video of me next to a theme park at night, me and my aunt having fun. 

He saw the first story which i wasn't there , he only saw the airplane photo shoot, he didn't unfollow yet but he didn't look at my second story that had my picture on, few hours later he saw my second story and unfollowed me.

I understand that if I tried to flirt with him without being his type or just being ugly would keep him away ,but really, we were just pretty good friends so I ask myself why..

Iâ€™ve been on them for 8 days now. I still feel bad. Now I know that they take more than week to have effect and I know they are not a fast way to happiness but still Iâ€™m getting anxious about medication and am afraid they will only make me worse.

My burnout symptoms where pretty much heart palpitations, heartburn, anxiety and finally insomnia that broke me to seek help. 

Since then - a bit over week ago - my symptoms are still the same if not even worse. 

And I am getting doubts if my medication is just making me feel worse. 

Should I just give them a chance now? Just wait for some days to see if they start to effect? Can it also be that if I have some effects from starting them that they will go away once I get used to meds? 

I just need some comfort to my thoughts and energy to keep going. I feel like my body is just on overdrive all the time.",depression_disorder
" 

I have been feeling this since last 2-3 days. I am totally not sure what to start with and I am not sure what to do?Is there any way to get out of this quick? We had exams before that so I think it is due to that...Is there any easy way to get out of this feeling? What is this feeling btw? burnout? brain fog? Or what?",depression_disorder

"I'll call you later.
I'll talk to you later.
We can meet later.
I'll tell you about how i feel - later.

Later is too late. I could be gone. I could be dead. I want to cherish everything now. I hate when someone uses the word ""later"". Why not now? Life's too short.",depression_disorder
"This is not a joke - I canâ€™t get off. I canâ€™t do anything. I have no interest to participate in life whatsoever. Itâ€™s not a sad feeling, Iâ€™m just so indifferent. If the world ended right now Iâ€™d still be indifferent.",depression_disorder
"I haven't seen many people saying something exactly like this but I say it a lot to my inner circle and wanted to see what more people had to say about it. I have seen my fair share of therapists and really only had 2 or 3 who were a good match, not all are. I really think a good therapist is somebody who doesn't just listen to you talk and gladly take your money. They're not somebody who lets you say whatever you want and either just believes all of it, doesn't interupt you or call you on it, or somebody who doesn't challenge you to actually get better by trying new things going outside your comfort zone or just realizing stuff about you. I'd say anyone who I've known who needs therapy who has gone and done idk like 5 sessions always thinks they're fixed and there was nothing wrong with them, but the issue was the therapist didn't do their job or care, because they should be there to identify the real problem- either you're hiding it, its touchy or you don't want to talk about it, or you didn't even know it was there and its never been addressed. This almost never happens except with truly exceptional rare hard to find therapists. This world is full of a lot of froofy political correctness and blowing butterflies and rainbows up peoples asses to make them feel good and nice and comfortable, but that doesn't spark change and every person who breaths needs to change, nobody is above this and everyone could use a little work on themselves. Therapy isn't supposed to be comfortable, safe yes, comfortable no, and there is a very big difference. The sad part is that so many people misunderstand the reason that people need therapy or the point of going, and the therapists think that helping looks like handholding and listening only and have no skills further on what to do. Far too many unqualified (in skills not education), undriven people and those who are mentally unstable people themselves decide to pursue a career in therapy, much like those in nursing- because they ""want to help people"" and they don't have any other skills or clue what to do. 
I like to say that for people graduating high school: men go into the armed forces or physical labor jobs, and women decide to be either a hair dresser, a nurse, or a therapist.

It really is too bad.
Oh and it should be cheaper.",depression_disorder
"I realized that I can't function in society it destroys me and my mental health. 

I realized that I will stay an immature person probably forever, there is a child who lives inside of my soul and can't grow up. I'm scared of arguments with other people and I'm scared of giving my opinion and if I try I get a panic attack.

I always feel like I'm out of place when I'm among adults, I feel like I can't be myself and everything around me is so scary and difficult. When I try to get back in the real world I get heavily depressed, get extreme anger attacks that could one day push me to murder, get endless amounts of panic attacks that affect my heart I feel like my heart is going to stop one day because of a panic attack.

I wanted to change the world for the better I had some kind of child's love for the world but the world is so horrible and I feel like there is no way to change it anymore and the only thing left to do is commit suicide.

The only thing that makes this life worth living is my friends, I decide to isolate myself with them and don't interact with anybody else. I also had to isolate myself on the internet because the internet is infested with porn and I could get a panic attack from it at any time.

If my friends will be gone I will have nothing worth living for, I'm ready to dedicate my whole life to them because they are the real and the only point of my life, I can't exist any other way",depression_disorder
"Iâ€™m tired of pretending. I have to put on this facade and act like everything is okay. And when I do lay it bare? I get told that â€œthis isnâ€™t like youâ€ or Iâ€™m just met with indifference.

No one ever gave a damn. I had friends and those I cared about just outright leave. Thereâ€™s no in between. Then what the fuck is there? It honestly feels like nothing.",depression_disorder
"I have depression amongst a menagerie of other things but im pretty sure the depression is the root of this and I want to know if anyone else relates. 
Most of my friendships and familial bonds are tight and I donâ€™t seem to ruin them with my depression but it always happens with romantic and potential romantic relationships.
I can be utterly infatuated with the person going on a year in advance but once the relationship starts I will quickly have resentment and almost feel suffocated for no reason.
especially in the one i am in now. We were doing so good I was actually happy and hopeful the relationship could work out. but being at college I had to come 17 hrs away home and this month away from her has made me start to drift away farther and farther and like I canâ€™t do it anymore. I donâ€™t know if that will go away when I see her in two weeks but i feel almost sick thinking about it. like i really want to see my friends again but thinking about going back to a relationshipâ€¦
I donâ€™t knowâ€¦ maybe this isnâ€™t depression maybe itâ€™s other deep issues but it absolutely sucks and I want to know if anyone else with depression can relate?",depression_disorder
"I looked in the mirror and all I could see was just this horrible, vile, disgusting person. I donâ€™t want to go into details but I intentionally hurt myself for the first time in my life. Itâ€™s bad because in those short moments, I felt so much relief from the pain. As if an alcohol addiction wasnâ€™t enough, here I am resorting to self-harm. Sigh",depression_disorder
"I dont claim to be an incel, or hate women, or want to harm anyone, i just was really curious. Because im 22, depressed, virgin, social anxiety, quiet, etc.. While im never supporting what he did, i definitely felt his pain. of just wanting to die when you've been undesired your whole life. I definitely have felt a lot of anger/mixed feelings over this, but i dont wanna harm anyone and im thankful. It is tough to keep going though. everywhere you go, its literally ALL sex, ALL relationships, its impossible as fuck to avoid. I've even seen worse looking people than me get relationships, the list goes on. A LOT of people tell you how overrated sex/relationships/etc are. I imagine it probably feels heavenly, to cuddle with someone you love, have good sex, enjoy time with your partner, and actually feel desired and worthy instead of some useless ghost. And I did understand 'some' of his points. like.. some women do go for shit men lets be real. The only girl I ever connected with in my life so strongly, would rather date someone who abused tf out of her, got her into a meth addiction, be very controlling, etc.. Women don't see anything in me. I guess depression takes all my good qualities away. Maybe im doomed to be a failure by nature. All that I know is if i was gonna create a hell, this would be a perfect would. I often question if i pissed something off in some other dimension and this is my punishment. Because god damn life is good at torturing",depression_disorder
"I've suffered with this since I was a kid and all I've ever wanted was to die. I've never made any life goals because I thought I'd be dead, I just can't find the courage to kill myself, even though there is absolutely no reason to stay alive, the world has gone to shit and it's only ever going to get worse. 

I'm just scared of messing up my suicide. I want it to be perfect, but I can't quite seem to find the perfect way to do it.",depression_disorder
"Iâ€™m a 22yo guy and Iâ€™ve been dealing with some mental health, as well as kidney problems. Recently Iâ€™ve felt like shit from a constant onslaught of panic attacks and a loss of appetite and this week has been one of the worst Iâ€™ve had this year in relation to that. Iâ€™m coming up on my last semester of a 4 year degree in college and itâ€™s not gonna be a fun semester from the looks of it. I just wanted to know if any of you have a chronic health condition and a (diagnosed) mental illness. If so is there anything that keeps you grounded when youâ€™re going through all of these problems at once. Also I am seeing a psychiatrist, however I always find it hard to talk to them like a person and not a doctor, not to mention Iâ€™m too poor to go as often as Iâ€™d like. Thanks in advance to anyone responding, love yâ€™all.",depression_disorder
"Okay so Iâ€™ll try to start from the beginning to put things into context. I come from a South Asian home. Long story, short SA daughters are expected to be miss perfect, home trained and not date or have boyfriends but when we are 25 we should randomly find a husband. SA women tend to be very sheltered, naive, people pleasers, submissive, rely on others etc we donâ€™t get to have life experiences like travel etc but our parents tend to be strict and say things like â€œtravel with your husbandâ€ and our curfew is 10pm ish so we donâ€™t get to experience nightlife etc

Also our families tend to be very broken. I donâ€™t come from a good home. My dads side is very toxic: always arguing about money and stupid shit. My grandma is insufferable and a terrible MIL to my mom and I feel sorry for my mom that she has to marry into such a terrible unloving family. So did I. I donâ€™t have any sisters or close cousins my age to interact with. I have one older bro (33 now) and he obviously didnâ€™t get as many restrictions like me. He treated our house like a hotel. Coming home at 3am. I came home at 2am once when I was 21 and got a whole lecture and my brother gets nothing. Heâ€™s a doctor and married now so he is successful and set in life. While Iâ€™m over here rotting away like a loser and Covid only made things worse..

Iâ€™ve never had a bf and Iâ€™m still a virgin. Not for religious reasons but Bc Iâ€™ve never connected with anyone like that. Even when I do put myself out there I attract low quality annoying men who talk too much (no offense but some men need to shut up) or emotionally unavailable men who just want to hook up. Which isnâ€™t me. Good men do exist, but they get taken quickly but good women. I donâ€™t have what it takes to attract a good men Bc they wouldnâ€™t go for a depressed 30 year old like me. I donâ€™t blame them either. I had a small window and I let it pass.

I donâ€™t make much ($45k take home pay) and I live with my parents. (I was gonna move on but Covid fucked everything up) I hate my college degree (accounting) and I donâ€™t see myself getting a MBA, quite frankly I hate studying and I know Iâ€™m too depressed to focus. I hate working too so why bother with more school. The only other option I have is to start a business, which is fucking hard when Iâ€™m not passionate about anything to even be motivated/have disciple. I donâ€™t have any ambitions or life long goals. Iâ€™m just here surviving poorly.

I have no friends either, I think that is obvious. And yes Iâ€™ve tried hobbies and meetups etc.. Iâ€™m not ugly but underweight (5â€™5, 113 lbs) Iâ€™ve been working out for over a year and havenâ€™t had that much gains Bc I donâ€™t eat enough Bc Iâ€™m depressed. Iâ€™m stuck in this negative feed back loop.

I have so much baggage now it is terrible. I wish I died young so I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with it. I hate myself, my mind and my life. I wish I could end my life just so I wouldnâ€™t have to think anymore. I wish I died of Covid. I donâ€™t see myself being alive in another 5 years. If I could die this moment, I would. I bought rope from amazon but havenâ€™t used it yet..

I fucking miss the early 2010s and being a kid so bad. Iâ€™d do anything to go back. The music, I had a decent social circle. But through the years Iâ€™ve lost contact with everyone. I didnâ€™t dorm so I missed out on college life and I resent my parents for that. Because I couldâ€™ve had more opportunities to make life long friends. Most ppl are just friends with their co workers or old classmates.

Iâ€™m full of so much hate that the people I do hate, I would watch their kids die and do nothing to help. If the purge were legal tomorrow, Iâ€™d kill them in a heartbeat. Yea Iâ€™ve gone to therapy and taken meds too..

I just hate being alive and everything that comes with it. Paying bills, eating and sleeping regularly, showering daily, etc. I hate meeting ppl now Bc I know they will disappoint me somehow. So now I just lock myself in my room, get high off thc gummies and listen to music. Thatâ€™s the only thing I somewhat look forward to. As pathetic as it sounds. 

Please donâ€™t come here trying to give my advice. Iâ€™ve done it all: hobbies, books, therapy, meds, exercise, diet, meditation. Please Iâ€™m sick of it, Iâ€™m not a mentally healthy person and my life is pointlessâ€¦ Iâ€™m a failure and a loser and Iâ€™m starting to accept that. It is 4:17 am and Iâ€™m writing this realizing how much I hate myself and how nothing means anythingâ€¦ Iâ€™d be better off dead. Women donâ€™t have a large prime to begin with. A lot more is expected from women and we have to get â€œour shit togetherâ€ earlier than men Bc patriarchy of course.

 I havenâ€™t been outside the country since I was 17 for a family wedding.. I have no friends to travel with and no I donâ€™t want to travel solo or with a womanâ€™s group with some strangers. I wasted my 20s and it is all my fault. Sure my family was strict but itâ€™s my fault now. I just wish I was dead. 

Idk if anyone will read or respond to this. I have no one to talk to anyway so it doesnâ€™t matterâ€¦ so might as well bare my soul on the internet, on a male dominated space anywayâ€¦",depression_disorder

"I spent some time looking back through my old blogging to see how I can compare my life now VS then for the purpose of celebrating my sobriety. But all it really did was just show how deeply alone and unhappy I have been in my life for so many years. Sure some things changed, but nothing really matters when your brain is just rotten with depressed thoughts and zero self worth. It seems like every year just strips away more and more happiness as I feel like more opportunities and doors continue to close on me. The only thing I can do is just try to cope with accepting that being sad and empty is just a big part of my life that will always be here.",depression_disorder

"i experience reality at a later age, probably 2 years ago. living in my own bubble only made me realize how much i left out in life. it hurts me more for being unable to cope with work life as if i just graduated high school. spent my entire youth just to get a diploma at 25 (then 2 years of service afterwards) without understanding that i should have my own responsibilities. i know i shouldnt make comparison with anyone younger, but still i envy these young folks who seems to appreciate with what they have.

"I don't know where else to post this so sorry if this is not the place. I wish sex didn't exist. I wish that lust wasn't a thing. I wish that there was no gender. That nobody had a body. Nobody had genitals. Nobody was ugly or beautiful. You were just ur personality. A spirit. That's it. I just feel weird and unhappy thinking about those things. I dont like how I'm not very masculine. I don't like my body. I don't like that I'm not muscular. I don't like how skinny I am. I don't like my acne, my oily skin, my coarse hair, my fat lips, my grating voice, my hunched stature, my angular frame. I hate my face. I hate that's all people see. If there wasn't gender, I wouldn't have all these confusing thoughts. I could like who ever I want. I could be whatever I feel. If we didn't have bodies, everyone would be equal. Nobody would feel insecure. There wouldn't be any of the ugly gross feelings associated with sex. No one would ever be sweaty, sore, dirty, in pain. Nothing would be left but everyone's beautiful wonderful thoughts and emotions. Isn't that what's most important? The most special thing we want to share? The thing that really is us?",depression_disorder
"So... Firstly, I have to admit, i was one if those ""you can choose to not be depressed"" people. I would tell depressed friends and family, ""just look at the bright side"" and ""a lot of people have it worse than you"" and ""snap out of it. You're going to be ok"". 

Now... I'm going through my first case of crippling depression. Can't seem to get out of bed. Always tired. Constant dark thoughts. Zero sense of worth. Its literally CRIPPLING. 

While i know that the advice i often gave was from a good place. It was also pure ignorance. I didn't know how bad it could get. 

So... I apologize to all those going through this. Not just for me, but for all those people in your lives giving the same clichÃ© hallmark advice that i gave. They do care. They just dont get it. From now on, I'll listen, I'll be there as an anchor and a shoulder, i won't pretend that i understand the depth of someone else's pain.

 The only thing good for me right now is a high GPA that's it. I don't have any friends I hate the way I look, the way I speak, the fact that I have glasses, I have acne all over my face, sometimes I just want to burn my face or slash it so that I have an excuse to be so goddam fucking ugly. 

Honestly, the only thing that's keeping me going is the fact I have my suicide planned out in exactly 9 years I am to kill myself and I am not doing it now because I am a coward. I just wish  I get enough courage to do it like in a week. I really really hate myself.",depression_disorder

"I've been in this rut for as long as I can remember. I dont know why but I've always had this plaque on my brain thats made my life difficult. Every day is a struggle and constant battle. I have been told that my depression and anxiety is most likely genetic and I live in pain. From the beginning I had no chance at being happy or ""normal"". I was destined to be physically and mentally exhausted. I was destined to be a burden to everyone in my life. 

My family (parents mostly) try to do everything in their power to give me a great life. They got me help when I needed it and try to understand as much as they can. Only so much can go a long way. They will never truly understand how it feels to live with what I have. No matter how many times I explain it to them I know that deep down they think my depression is a ""deep sadness"" caused by outside factors. I know it's hard to understand things you don't personally go through but it sucks to know that no matter what you say or do, you'll constantly be misunderstood 

I dont really have friends. I just have acquaintances. I used to have ""friends"" but they were mostly held together by circumstances i no longer have. I dont go out, I only go to work, school and back home. My life is a never ending cycle of monotony. A never ending loop of struggling to get out of bed and trying to walk the earth as a normal functioning human being. I have nothing really keeping me going. No relationships besides the familial ones I have with my parents and my job. 

It has never been this bad before but I feel it getting even worse. I dont know how much more I can handle. The mix of being born with a hindrance and no outside motivation/ stimulation turns for a bleak future on my end. I truly have nothing to live for but im just too chicken to actually jump the gun.

Youâ€™re so cheerful all the time.â€ and does not give me any words of comfort. Similar thing with my friends, where Iâ€™d tell them how Iâ€™m not doing too well and I would try and open up but it always just goes back to how theyâ€™re having a harder time. I used to try my best to be emotional available for them, but I feel at my limit. I donâ€™t know if I just have high expectations or theyâ€™re really just not that emotionally invested in me.",depression_disorder

"I had a mental health crisis a few months ago that my parents were ill equipped for.

I have ptsd and am struggling with daily life and am still apologizing to them for my behavior, because I know they will never. I fearfully asked them if I could come home. And that was my father's response to me.

Iâ€™m been depressed since may over the most wonderful girl I know. I know itâ€™s stupid to be depressed over a girl but I am very much. Maybe because she doesnâ€™t feel exactly like I do and it unleashed a flood of unresolved trauma but I canâ€™t focus on anything but her and something small happened today regarding her and it set me off Iâ€™m just drinking to get rid of this pain. I love this girl I really do even though sheâ€™s with another I still love her and itâ€™s even more complicated for me because now sheâ€™s dating a girl out of no where and Iâ€™m so depressed Iâ€™ve been drinking so heavily and smoking drugs anything to get rid of my mental pain. Iâ€™ve cut myself and bruised my body and snuffed cigarettes out on me I think Iâ€™ve tired to kill my self but donâ€™t really know Iâ€™ve been so drunk and out of it because I canâ€™t find healthy outlets. But this girl I canâ€™t get over her and wonâ€™t I just love her and love her itâ€™s so confusing and complicated to me as itâ€™s all so knew and I never thought Iâ€™d do this and maybe itâ€™s the beer and whiskey giving me the courage to do this but I need help because Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m gonna be dead sooner or later somehow and I feel like this girl is the only way to save me and bring that happiness back Iâ€™ve known her my whole life and her not returning my love is killing me literally. Iâ€™m just 17 and have had such and unpleasant life and the girl Iâ€™ve always cared for doesnâ€™t feel the same and I know itâ€™s a little thing but I just want to die. My mother doesnâ€™t understand my depression and my father is a drug addict and never there and this girl helped me when I almost may have died and I love her.

For years now I've been battling depression and what scares me the most is knowing that one small screw up could cost my life and I know that sounds bad but if you know what I've been through it wouldn't be that bad.

"My mom had been battling cancer since 2016, and on October 7th, 2021 she passed away from Acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 
After she passed, and for the next few months up until now, I was numb about everything. I couldnâ€™t cry even if I wanted to. In fact, I could put on a fake smile and act like I was outgoing and happy &amp; honestly no one ever thought anything was wrong. 
After going through panic attacks, different meds, multiple therapists and intense introspection, What I think has been happening is Iâ€™ve been blocking my emotions subconsciously to help protect &amp; distance myself from this situation, and now that time has passed, I can actually think about it healthily and go through the grieving process.

Did a number of test and pretty much all came out alright, except for the urine test I did a couple days ago that found traces of protein and ketones. But the doctor only told me to drink more water. I haven't been eating well, only once a day. I can't even finish a single plate. I might be dehydrated, because I don't drink much as well, but I don't feel thirsty. I haven't been taking care of myself either, rarely brushed my teeth since then. My sleep is also messed up. I can't do anything. Every one of these is making me depressed..... I've been depressed once with a bit of suicidal tendency, although I will never act on it due to personal belief. I thought I'm alright now, but it seems to be returning. I feel empty, feels like I'm not gonna live till I'm thirty....... I'm tired, I just wanna sleep and not wake up, but I'm scared of death. Scared to leave my family, friends and my pets.

Its just hard to eat, even fucking candy, its hard to use my mouth, like it takes sm energy out of me. It got to the point where I wouldn't even get up to eat when it felt like my stomach was really desperate for food and my head was hurting so bad, it felt like I was gonna pass out.

I have depression and a good amount of my friends struggle with depression as well. At first I thought this would be a good thing because I would be able to relate to them and it would make me feel understood and less alone.

Being around that negative thinking (my friends always say things like â€˜oh my god Iâ€™m gonna kill myselfâ€™ as a joke) and just their pessimistic outlook just really brings me down. I feel like I need to surround myself with positive energy because when Iâ€™m with my family or with friends who are not depressed I feel much much better. I donâ€™t really know what to do now because I love my friends so I canâ€™t just drop them and I canâ€™t just tell them to be less negative or less depressed.

The other night my friend calls me and he tells me he wants to kill himself I shoot over to him got him back to my place and got him stable. I let him talk and get shit off his chest. He feels guilty for not being able to give the ones he loves the life's he thinks they should have and that he feels like he is a tax because of that. He's 18 right out of high-school so of course he can't give people car and  Mansions and shit like that but it doesn't matter that I tell him that because it's not going to change hiw he feels. Like for example and im not patting my self on the back he has had really shity luck with his last few vehicle so when a friend of ours that I trust would fuckem over said he had a good  reliable truck for sale that he just put $4000 in to and he would sell it to him for $2800 I herd my friend say he was $1100 short I went to the back and got him the money so he could get the truck I thoght I was doing a good thing for him trying to help him. I tolled him I don't want the money back and that him have the truck and better off over all was way more valuable then the money. I love him like he is my brother. But the other night he tells me he feels guilty for having taken the money. So I don't know what the fuck to do I love him and try to help him in any way I can but me helping him makes him feel worse. What should I do? I'm geting stuck in my own head think that maybe im the problem and that I'm inadvertently making him feel this way. I'm struggling with my own demons and this is really making things harder for me because now I feel like shit for making him feel like shit... help please im not strong enough or smart enough to save the both of us,depression_disorder

"I have been struggling with postpartum depression since the birth of my second daughter in June 2021. It has recently come to a head where my therapist wants me to take a medical leave from work and enter an in Patient mental health program. 

I have been talking to my husband about it and he thinks that my therapist and I are being over dramatic. He is concerned that we cannot financially support me taking a leave of absence from work and thinks that I just need to try harder. 

My husband is a perfectionist, a former marine, and a police officer. He likes the house to be clean and orderly and he gets frustrated when it isnâ€™t. I recently have been struggling so bad that I am choosing between showering and doing the dishes (I always choose the dishes to make my husband happy) which means that today was the first time I showered since before Christmas. 

I told my husband that I could potentially avoid taking a medical leave if I could do the therapy in the evenings after work meaning I wouldnâ€™t really help with the house or the kids. I told him the number 1 thing I needed from him was to not let his frustration show with the process. Instead, I needed him to be supportive, happy, and jovial otherwise I would feel like a burden and the whole process wouldnâ€™t work. He said â€œhow am I supposed to act like you arenâ€™t a burden when you are refusing to do anything to stop being a burdenâ€. 

This confirmed to me that I am making his life worse and not better. I am not and have never been actively suicidal and I wouldnâ€™t want to do anything to take me away from my daughters. But I want to stop burdening my husband with my bullshit and I canâ€™t figure out how. It feels completely hopeless at this point. I know that one day soon my husband will wake up and realize he doesnâ€™t have to deal with this shit and just leave me. Part of me even wishes he would just to save himself. 

Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m looking for with this post. I just needed to get it all off my chest. I want to be better. I want to feel good. I just wish I knew how.",depression_disorder
"About to start my last semester of college but it feels like I'm in a cycle where nothing gets better even though I always have lots of people to talk to, classes and a job that I love, etc. 

I always look forward to starting the new semester. My classes are really interesting, I go to a small school so I'm with a lot of the same people all the time and it's great, I love my lab job at a local hospital with great coworkers, everything about my situation is always great at the beginning,but things get progressively worse throughout the semester. 

I have lots of friends, I'm super close with my coworkers and I love going to work, I get very good grades, but still the more time goes on the more empty i start to feel. 

Sleeping feels amazing though and it's the one time where i can relax after a long day, but whenever i have dreams its always about me getting sexually assaulted, raped, or forced to watch people commit suicide. I used to be suicidal (havent felt that way in 3+ years) and I was sexually assaulted multiple times in the past, but these dreams happen almost every night when I get stressed and I wake up feeling mentally exhausted, and I still have the whole day ahead of me. This happens on a cycle of 4-5 months and is way worse during the school year and its happend like this for all of college. The cycle never changes whether I get a different job, start hanging out with different people, take different classes, or any other factor. 

I dont know what to do anymore. I want to get a therapist bc I have a really hard time processing my trauma and I cant talk to anyone about it, not even my closest friends know what happened in my past. But it's so expensive and it's just not practical as a college student.

"im tired of living my life. this feeling started when i was a teen when the situation of my parents worsened when i tried to do what u thought was right. (mom was cheating and i caught her). it eventually lead to their seperation and i kept blaming myself because it can still be fixed. since then, i've developed anxiety and have told no one. i kept crying on random occassions, having breakdowns and isolating myself from my friends. i started harming myself through not eating nor drinking for about 2 weeks when the situations around me worsened. i couldnt do what i usually do even the most important task. when my ex broke up with me because she cheated, my trauma was brought up and finally lost my will to live. i attempted suicide through cutting. i thought that would be my last moments and i didnt felt any regret on what i did. when the bleeding stopped, i was disappointed. after that day, i just started to get back on my feet and tried to distract myself as much as possible but now i'm scared to become alone again because i know that if i had a breakdown, i would probably end my life because i now know how precise i should be. this feeling just keeps getting heavier and heavier everyday. every single fucking day i would have a breakdown on a random time. a lot of strangers have told me that i should seek therapy but i dont think that would work nor i would want to see one.",depression_disorder

"It's been like this for at least 6 years.  It hurts the most when I'm in bed and the things I use to take my mind off reality are gone.

It is mentally painful to lay down and try go to sleep.  I have started biting my cheek really hard when I feel the dread of not having an emotional outlet.  

I know for a fact that my parents love me and they treat me that way but I still feel really uncomfortable getting hugged by them and I tend to have as little contact as possible when they hug me.

I just want to scream as loud as I can to satisfy even a little of the mental pain.

I'm not getting better, I'm just getting worse no matter how hard I try. And nobody sees it, because I have to cover it up, it's a disease that nobody cares about. I don't interest anyone.

"When I get invited to go somewhere, I donâ€™t go because most of the time Iâ€™m not well enough to be around people. I know by now that If I show up to social gatherings or just be in public places, I will get criticized and judged, even bullied. I still have to go to work and face reality. Some days I would be peaceful minding my business at work or on the train and get called some horrible things like â€œb*tchâ€, and â€œyouâ€™re a racistâ€. Even parents and distant relatives, they all have an opinion and choose to assume the worst. You donâ€™t show up, theyâ€™re mad. You show up to support them, theyâ€™re annoyed that youâ€™re not dancing or giving speech in front a crown. Theyâ€™ll say things like â€œif you donâ€™t want to be here, why did you even bother coming?â€. 

Iâ€™m now learning how to cope with this sickness. I already feel like such a burden with this blank look on my face most of the time, but if people only knew how broken I feel inside. Itâ€™s sad to know that people would rather say hurtful things instead of asking how youâ€™re doing. I understand why people battling depression choose to commit suicide.
Society wonâ€™t let them suffer in peace. I never knew what depression meant in my younger years, I just remembered feeling like I needed to isolate myself. My parents donâ€™t even try to understand, they would take it personal like Iâ€™m being ungrateful. My mother would refer to me as â€œthe b*tchâ€ and â€œwhoreâ€ when no one is around and then call family and cry to them that Iâ€™m being cruel to her by being in my room all the time. They agree with her because I donâ€™t show up to their events. This is hard. Iâ€™m using all my strength to stay alive because I have 3 teenage nieces.",depression_disorder

"For certain moments in my life Iâ€™ve been accused of being a dull person. Iâ€™ve tried to fend off those accusations over three years but tonight it just seems like Iâ€™ve finally come to terms with this â€œidea.â€

I can remember throughout my elementary, middle, and high school school years where it was always difficult for me to concentrate in class because I was so worried about my environment and who was in class. My grades in every level of school were just absolutely terrible and I was even held back a year. 

Even though I graduated high school, fast forward to now and I still realize that I am indeed dull. I lack an open mind and have no clue whatâ€™s going on in our world. Itâ€™s ruined potential friendships and relationships, and itâ€™s also starting to destroy the connections within my own household. I hate that I never smart enough to create a path for success. I was selfish and unwilling to seek new opportunities, and I still am. The lack of education has kept my worldly knowledge below limits. 

I donâ€™t watch the news, I donâ€™t study politics, I donâ€™t try new activities, I donâ€™t experience new locations, I donâ€™t make friends and I certainly donâ€™t have friends. I go days, sometimes even weeks without even leaving the house. Part of being dull is that itâ€™s difficult to express my personality because people realize that Iâ€™m not an interesting person. Thereâ€™s so much that I donâ€™t know about life, and I quite frankly donâ€™t care about whatâ€™s going on. Quite often, I can tell when people are disinterested in my personality and it continues to show. The reality is Iâ€™m very closed-minded and as I still live with my parents, there hasnâ€™t been pressure to push me to start somewhere, and I donâ€™t believe Iâ€™ll ever find the motivation to do so. 

Iâ€™m not really looking for a particular solution as I just needed to empty my thoughts. Iâ€™m lost in the fray and Iâ€™ve known that for years. Every person who I ever come into contact with eventually realizes that I have nothing to offer, let alone being able relate with them.",depression_disorder
"All the people I went to school and college with are having the time of their lives. Living abroad, promotions, falling in love and getting married. I have been stuck in a time capsule for 15 years now and I donâ€™t have anything going on for me, absolute nada. Everyone says I should keep trying and never give up but can anybody tell me when am I going to reap all these benefits from doing said hard work ?

My introversion and avoidant personality has fucked me over, both in personal life and at work. The universe fucking hates me. I drown in my own sorrow everyday and my efforts are never enough. I am so exhausted and I donâ€™t want to go further anymore. Can anybody just lend me a rope I wanna hang myself.",depression_disorder
"I feel like Iâ€™m always being told Iâ€™m too sensitive when it comes to my family. I would much rather stay home then go interact with people at this point.

I just feel so lonely yet I donâ€™t want to be around anymore for fear of any bad interactions. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m too sensitive but when your family isnâ€™t kind to you, or says hurtful stuff idk itâ€™s just getting to the point that I donâ€™t even want to be here anymore.

Then theyâ€™re birthday rolls around and I am a great gift giver because I am very thoughtful. I feel invited because the person wants a cool gift or because the want huge numbers at their party.

"When the pandemic came, I returned to my familyâ€™s home as I could do my job remotely and thought to take care of them should anything happen.

It was cool as I had a group of 6 friends that basically became my Pandemic Party as we all just hung out and stayed as safe as possible from Covid. I started exercising, spent a lot of time outdoors and at the beach, and as things started opening up again started to appreciate and enjoy regular mass group activities.

With things seemingly back to normal, I find my life to be boring now and I honestly donâ€™t even enjoy some daily activities as much. I feel like Iâ€™ve played a video game and earned massive amounts of money but I have nothing to spend it on. But itâ€™s not the money as much as thereâ€™s nothing left to do. I have a stable job but no interest in finding a girl, marrying, buying a house, anything that grownups want to get back to doing with the pandemic in the rearview mirror, etc

I honestly think that if I died in the pandemic it would have been ok. Without any ambition, Iâ€™m like semiretired or something. Like Iâ€™ve peaked.

I have at least a 2nd half of my life to live but I keep thinking Iâ€™m only going to get older and uglier, see friends less because theyâ€™re having kids or ambitions to be generationally wealthy, sit around watching sports games because I donâ€™t care to do anything in my spare time. 

Just feel Iâ€™m going through the motions each day. Nothing excites me. It doesnâ€™t help that I donâ€™t like to spend money. I will be a person who dies with a boatload of retirement money because I canâ€™t get myself to spend hundreds and thousands at any one time

I read that people get happiness Far more from experiences than physical items but I donâ€™t think about traveling, going to a concert.

i've been struggling in school since freshman year (i'm a junior now) i've had a bunch of ups and downs throughout the years but i have never been truly happy in anything i did...for the past 3 years i have been coming home, sleeping, eating a little bit, and sleeping again....i have no drive to do the things i used to love (building computers, coding, drawing, speedcubing, powerlifting, hanging out with friends) this is the year it's been the worst...i was lazy and procrastinated a ton during 9th and 10th grade and im behind in a ton of school credits...as a junior i still am behind in a bunch of classes and i might not even graduate on time...i feel so drained but i always act happy infront of eveyone...i hide it from the world...i want to open up but i don't because 

....i feel like i have no right to feel this way.,.. im in an upper middle class family, i have a car, i have a job, i have healthy family and great friends..why do i feel like this i just can't understand why i'm being such a pussy right now..there are so many others going though worse and i have the audacity to not feel happy...my parents are so dissapointed in me..im dissapointed in myself for letting my grades go down so far knowing i should've just sucked it up....i just want to enjoy my old hobbies again....i want to enjoy hangin out with people again...i want a girlfriend or maybe just a girl i can hangout with and enjoy time with...i just want to feel the sense of worth in myself and somebody to hold...i can't talk about it to my dad i was raised very emotionally resistant and i feel like i can't talk about my feelings to people i know, especially since i've never gave signs of it in public..im pretty popular in school and eveyone sees me as the funny up type of guy...i've been building this up for years and my first way of getting it out is this simple post...

moral of the story, im 16 i feel like shit about myself i have no drive to do what i once loved, im tired and i just want someone to hold me...but my life to others is so good and im blessed to be where im at.. and for that reason i feel like a selfish teenager that doesn't have the right to be sad about anything 

does anyone have any advice for me to get over this quicker it's been months and i've afraid to talk to people i know because they will say the same thing that i say ""you have it all just stop being lazy""

i dont know what to do anymore. that online school i mentioned messed up all my classes like i passed english 9 but they gave me english 9 again and i was supposed to have earth space but they gave me chemistry and i tried to email them but it never worked so i just eventually came to terms with it and gave up.

"Hello Everyone,

Iâ€™d like to humbly ask for this communityâ€™s help/advice/guidance. 

Iâ€™m an objectively intelligent and capable 33 year old male. I have had treatment resistant depression my entire life, and have struggled severely in the â€œcareerâ€ aspect of my life. 

Iâ€™ve pretty much failed at maintaining a long-term job my entire adult life. 

Over Covid lockdown, I realized that â€œremote workâ€ was a suitable and viable option for me. 

Does this community have any recommendations on resources, jobs, companies, forums, etc. that I should look to in my pursuit of getting a remote job? 

Thank you all. 

- God Bless ðŸ™ðŸ»",depression_disorder

 There are many issues that I deal with in my daily life. I am a person who basically has a counselor stamp on my forehead for as long as I could remember.

I have found that people don't really take the time to get to know me. Like really know me.

"*tw: death, cancer

tonight on the phone with my parents, we were just chitchatting like normal, talking about tax day, etc. and at the very end of the conversation they had a few pieces of news to give me. apparently my siblingsâ€™ brother-in-law (ik it sounds complicated) got very badly injured after slipping off from something and had been in the hospital for the past week. then, my uncle (by marriage) had (maybe is still having?) a heart attack and has been in the hospital since late afternoon. oh, and i had found out that our dear family friendsâ€™ 10-year-old son was just diagnosed with bone cancer a couple weeks ago, but tonight they told me that he started chemo on thursday, had a good day, and okay day, and then started having really bad days (not eating, drinking, etc). 

so once we sort of talk about all of this and i think are getting ready to end the call, my dad gets a call from my sister and so my mom and i are listening to his reactions and i could just tell it was bad news about my sisterâ€™s brother-in-law. his heart stopped while getting a routine  procedure in the ICU. that was the only update she really had, other than her updating us on if his daughter (high school) knew yet. my parents and i kind of stayed on the phone in silence for a few min, until i felt the waterworks really coming on and got off. 

finally got myself together (also should mention that iâ€™m not a crier) after about 37 minutes. really only probably had about 10 minutes like this before i get another call from my mom and just know itâ€™s not good. she tells me he didnâ€™t make it. 

needless to say, itâ€™s been a really difficult evening. iâ€™ve generally donâ€™t have this mindset of â€œof COURSE this would happen to meâ€ (in a bleak and serious way) / really really pessimistic 

â€¦. but DAMN.. i had already been sort of starting to think that even before this phone call. two weekends ago i got chewed out by a client at work.  fucked up my commute time last monday and only had 5 min to get ready for work before bringing my dog to daycare. then arrived to work where i double booked myself for interviews and client appointments. then managed to pull a muscle in my neck that afternoon.  soo thatâ€™s essentially how my week started last week and it didnâ€™t really get much better (e.g. found out this kind older woman who was one of my moms customers and was very fond of our family, passed away at 91, leaving behind her many cats she rescued, my childhood house was torn down, etc.). 

so this is just a big old vent bc i felt like my depression was really creeping back in to start, and then it has just been like sucker-punch after sucker-punch :/",depression_disorder

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this here but itâ€™s so heavy and Iâ€™m so unhappy, I needed to get it out somehow

Iâ€™ve always been in and out of depression since I was like 14. More than a year ago things was getting better and with the birth of my kid I was really happy but it never last. 

Im fat and I binge eat a lot. A few months ago I started counting my calories and it was going great. Iâ€™ve lost 15lbs the first 3 weeks and then I ate one chocolate bar and after that my habits slowly became like it was before.. 

I eat way to much every night, I canâ€™t sleep, I have bad anxiety and I hate myself so much.  I canâ€™t even look at me in a mirror, all I think when Iâ€™m out in public is that everyone must think Iâ€™m disgusting . Iâ€™m to ashamed to go eat at a restaurant and going grocery shopping is always so hard

My mind constantly remember me how much Iâ€™ve fail, of All the things I donâ€™t do. It happens with family, when Iâ€™m alone, the worst is at night, it never stops! Iâ€™ve stop painting, all I do when im not with my son is watch tv so my head doesnâ€™t start to spin 

All I wear is way to big t-shirt and leggings, I feel ugly and Iâ€™m sick of these t-shirt. Iâ€™m sick of everything!

It has taken over my life and Iâ€™m just so sick of it .. I canâ€™t do it anymore ! I donâ€™t know how to really change things. Iâ€™m just so sad all the time. I pity my son for the mother he got,I love him so much I wanted to be better for my little baby but it seems I canâ€™t even do it for him 

All I see when I thinks about my baby is that I could be a better mom ! Do more activities, wondering if heâ€™s stimulated enough, if Iâ€™m raising him right and the anxiety kicks. So even if heâ€™s the most beautiful things thatâ€™s ever happened to me I canâ€™t think about him without feeling like shit! Iâ€™ve got no happy place in my mind 

Itâ€™s just a small parts of everything thatâ€™s bad there so much more shit Iâ€™ve lived throughout the years and I donâ€™t know where to start to change it and heal.",depression_disorder
"So 6 months ago i met this girl. All my friends had left for college so i told her i only wanted to be friends. I also figured she was too attractive for me and didn't see us dating. 

A month into us being friends she got a boyfriend. it was around this same time we grew really close. We were hanging out almost daily, grocery shopping together, buying eachother gifts, always complimenting eachother, sleeping in the same bed, hugging and saying we loved eachother constantly, etc.

We've never done anything sexual, even tho there's been tension. like intense eye contact, talking really gentle/highpitched to eachother, cooking meals for eachother, sharing a chair and getting snuggled up. we've also confided with eachother about young trauma we haven't told anyone and we have cried together a lot.

we respect her relationship. her bf knows a lot about our friendship and doesn't seem to care.

my friend had always said if he had a problem with our friendship she would dump him, and that she'd choose me over him.

Idk if that's still the case now. we hangout maybe once every two weeks and she says she's in love and wants to marry him even tho it's only been like 4 months and they have had some issues. he's also got a kid and is 26 with a dui and she's only 18. but i'm not gonna touch on that really.

It just sucks. she constantly texts me she misses me, loves me, and hopes we can hang this week, and she misses how things were, but she never asks me to hang anymore, and when she does it's usually for a couple hours. and when she does see me she's always rubbing my back, hugging me, hitting my thigh and being all affectionate.

i just don't get it. yeah she's busy with her bf but how do we go from hanging almost daily to her never making time for me anymore. did she never really care about me? what makes it harder is my obvious feelings for her, and the fact she's my only friend. 

i certainly put all my eggs in one basket and am definitely too nice to her but idk what else to do.

"I have no where else to turn, so here goes nothing.

Im (f)23 years old, and cannot remember a time in my life that I wasn't depressed. I started trying medication and then was hospitalized at 13 for suicidal ideation and self harm, and it hasn't been good since. I've tried over 10 different antidepressants, then was diagnosed with bipolar depression and tried antipsychotics WITH antidepressants. Some worked and then stopped, others gave me adverse reactions like suicide attempts and manic episodes full of rage, but not one thing worked long-term. 

About a year ago, I tried a combination that worked really well for me. So much so that I enrolled in college to study engineering. I worked out every day, ate healthy, spent time with friends and family, had hobbies, was actually truly happy. Before my first semester even started, my meds stopped working. I barely made it almost halfway through this semester and then became debilitated with depression and anxiety. I started TMS, a new depression treatment that is 70-80% effective, it didn't work. I just recently dropped out of college. I haven't driven a car or made a phone call in 2 months. I have not one ounce of joy, or even neutrality. I am miserable. All I do is cry. I wake up and eat junk food all day for the temporary pleasure of it. I don't shower or brush my teeth or speak to anyone. Nothing helps. All the things I used to enjoy feel like tedious chores.

"Hello there, i've been separated from my wife and her child, after 4 months of constant fights and a really agonizing life, currently i'm unemployed and i feel like a total failure, i really can't seem to get a hold of life.

It al began one year ago when i met my to-be wife, it wasn't a love at first sight, i liked her and started dating her, at first it was ok but then the problems started arising, to start she was so jealous of my time that she would get angry if i made a plan that didn't involve her, and she would call me selfish for not being with her, so i gave up and started dedicating more of my time to her, damaging my professional life and my family, after 6 months of this, i started staying at her place, so i could be more involved with her and her son, her son is amazing, i felt a click when i met him, but it was horrid being with her, always being reprimended for not doing the things the way she wanted. 

At the start of this year, we found out she was pregnant, a hard blow for my aspirations, i had in mind leaving my country and move to Canada, to study and get a work over there, after these news i felt sad, i know i will love my daughter with all my heart but it still feels bad, abandon all my dreams in the pursue of someone else happiness, so i again gave up, i moved in together and got married, life wasn't so bad, i helped her child improve at school and everyone (her family and friends) were glad i took the mantle for being the father and her husband. 

At the start of March, she started developing problems with her family, they were a financial crutch after i resign my job, she would constantly reminded me that i wasn't bringing nothing into the house and she would reprimend me for buying things that i wanted (snacks, coffee, etc), so then i gave up again my space, the day of our wedding celebration she gets in a big fight with her family, because the clothes and shoes she wore that day weren't of her approval. The next day i was kinda hungover over the celebration, and after taking breakfast with her family i decided to take a nap, during which she got into a bigger discussion with her family, severing the bond completely. 

In the days after the big fight she started blaming me for taking the nap and not being there to stop the fight and support her, her insults get bigger and bigger, so one day i snap, i start mocking her and verbally abuse her, we talk it out in the night, after things chill out and everything feels better. In the morning of the next day, i tell her that the situation with my unemployment i feel desperate and like a failure, when we arrive home after leaving her child at school i sit down and start sending job applications through my phone, she starts complaining that i haven't pick up the dog's poop, and she will not have wasting my time on my phone, i ignore her, i really don't need this, all i want is to find a job so i can live without feeling like shit, she starts yelling me and throws me a pet lotion, everything goes to shit, and we have our worst fight ever, after a physical confrontation (i've never in my life had the idea of hurting someone, specially someone you love, but still i did) i feel like the biggest piece of shit, so i tell her i want to kill myself, she manages to avoid that i do any harm to me, police arrive, and they take us to the police station where we chat with the psychologist, after a brief session they drive us back at her place. It is time that she goes for her child, she goes, i make the supper, we eat together, we talk in the night, and we decide to still try this, for her child, we both agree.

Life continues, i make it possible so that she can make ammends with her family, they do, everything starts to be better, but the constant recclaims never cease to exist, i start get behind in some freelance stuff, i'm starting to get involved, because most of my time goes to her, the child and keeping the house to her standards, i start to get frustated again, she again starts to reprimend me about everything, so again we fight, this time is only words, she tells me that i have to leave, i tell her i can't because all of my work stuff is in the house, i yell to her that she should leave, that i really don't wanna see her again, that it is the last time she is gonna see me, when she's about to leave with her child, everything feels so wrong, so instead i leave, not before assuring that i insult her one more time, so she remembers the piece of shit i am, i leave in my car, all i want is to kill my self, i'm screaming and crying, i really want to die, but i don't want to destroy my car (my dad gift it to me) so i return, i leave the keys, my wallet and my cellphone. And I start walking, towards the highway, so i will walk until i die, because i'm a piece of shit, when i'm almost reaching the highway something pulls me to return.

I return her family is there, my family is searching for me, everything is a fucking mess, i really want to die, i apologize to her family, i tell my father-in-law that he should kill me for being a piece of shit to her daughter, everyone can see my total distress, they try to comfort me, i tell them that i will seek help, but that her daugther also needs it, since october of the last year i've been telling her that she needs professional help, they agree, i leave with my parents, and everything is at this moment.

I can work, eat and in general i try anything that keeps my mind busy, i'm already in touch with my therapist, i don't know what is going to happen, all i know is that everytime that i think of her child, something in me dies, i really love him, i just wanna hold him and tell him that everything is gonna be alright, but i know, i'm not there, it consumes me, to think that everything was for nothing, and that i'm never gonna see him again.

A tar that I can't peel off of my skin, or if I do it tears away layer and layer with it. I try so hard just to relate to people but I can't because this undeterminable and invisible sickness is wearing me down, melting me, and all i seem to be able to do is wait.",depression_disorder

"After a long weekend of socializing my batteries are drained. Which means I have no energy left to even try to be nice to myself. I am currently lying in bed wallowing in loneliness and sorrow. I can't help but misinterpret the things my friends say and do as being about me or rubbing things in my face. Right now I feel like the universe and everyone else is telling me that no one could ever love me and I'll die alone never having had any serious romantic needs fulfilled. And feeling that way and believing it's true hurts. It hurts a LOT. 

It has crossed my mind to try to stop the hurt mostly through really not good means. But doing anything serious just passes the pain on to other people, and I do not want to hurt anyone else.

Everything sucks today...",depression_disorder
"I'll be posting something else in the future but for now I just want to remark how much it pisses me off when people joke about them being suicidal and using it as a casual remark like I'm going to go kill myself if I don't pass or if they don't release that one song, etc. Maybe it is because I think of suicide everyday and the very thought of someone else saying they go through the same shit when it is all bull just turns my stomach in a knot and gets my blood flowing. Not that I express that anger and it just makes me more depressed in a way. It brings back all the reasons I want to die, and it is even harder when they ask about how I feel directly afterwards. I just can't, although, again, this is just my opinion.",depression_disorder
"Iâ€™m 18 years old and still in education. The biggest thing that has caused me to be depressed is not being able to talk to people, and not having any friends. But I have the comfort of having gone to the same school for the past 7 years, and knowing that most of the people there donâ€™t mind me, and are fine with the fact that I donâ€™t talk much. But I know that as soon as I step out of that comfort zone (which is very soon) things will become so much difficult. Going to university, or into a job, I know that I wonâ€™t be able to talk to, fit in, and I certainly wonâ€™t be able to make any friends. Iâ€™m just too awkward and socially anxious, coupled with the fact that I never really do anything. Right now it feels like Iâ€™m just ticking down the last days of still having some comfort in my life, been though things are already so difficult as they are. But I know that they will only get worse.",depression_disorder
"TLDR: Does anyone else suffer from mental illness but still appear like they have their life together? I feel so incredibly alone and invalidated. If youâ€™re also high functioning can you please share your story? 

Iâ€™m (22F) diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I am medicated for all three. Iâ€™ve struggled with my mental health for over 10 yearsâ€¦ starting when I was a preteen. On paper Iâ€™m a high achieving, Type A, responsible and hardworking personâ€¦. Iâ€™m a junior in college majoring in a stem field, have a 3.5 cumulative GPA, in Honor Societies and on the Deanâ€™s List, and also work part time plus extra things like volunteering. Iâ€™m on track for graduate school. It has been this way my whole life. Iâ€™ve been told many times that Iâ€™m what every parent dreams of their child becoming.

Underneath all that though, I have multiple su*cide attempts and frequent ideation, self hatred, excessive drinking, mood swings, obsessive thoughts and behaviors, periods of insomnia, disordered eating, hundreds upon hundreds of self harm scars (albeit in strategic places) + other less noticeable self destructive tendencies, a few years of substance abuse, three inpatient psychiatric stays, and anxiety attacks that leave me crippled for hours. I feel like if it werenâ€™t for my anxiety kicking my ass into gear every day out of fear, I would likely show more noticeable depression symptoms. My self worth lies in my grades and the praise that follows it. 

No one knows this side of me unless theyâ€™re very close to me because I donâ€™t like talking about it. I feel so invalidated when websites and doctors and therapists and nurses have told me it canâ€™t be *that* bad if I can keep a job and get As in school and do my laundry. I know Iâ€™m part of a minority regarding depression. I feel like no one takes me seriously when I say Iâ€™m struggling. I donâ€™t want to talk about how Iâ€™m not okay because *clearly* Iâ€™m doing wonderful and *obviously* thereâ€™s nothing to worry about !! 
Does anyone else experience thisâ€¦",depression_disorder
"I'm a 20 year old male and where I come from, nobody understands you no matter what you say. You've been feeling depressed? ""There's nothing to be depressed about you're just faking it"" thats the answer you get. No matter how many times I've tried talking about my feelings, my problems no one understood. I've come to the point that I've started suppressing my emotions and it's killing me. It's like carrying a huge Boulder on your back, it hurts. It kills. I just got tired of fake laughing, faking that I'm alright, that I'm happy, that there's nothing wrong with me. I just have so many thoughts, I can't stop thinking. My hair started turning gray, my heart feels weak and my body is so exhausted. I've lost all pleasure in things I used to enjoy. All I can do is listen to music all day. But music too had become meaningless. I've lost hope in myself. All I want now is for things to be better. I thought about suicide many times and I'm thinking about it right now. Maybe if I go away things will be better, maybe this pain would end. But I can't. I can't cause I'm too scared to even try. I don't want to die. I just want things to become better. But how could it be when all I do is get angry on everything. I want to cry and pour all my heart over but I can't. Cause everyone will think I'm weak. I can't hold it anymore. I'll sleep now maybe things will be better tomorrow. I hope.",depression_disorder

And no one seems to want to help 17 year olds, I live in the UK and I've been to my doctor about needing help, and my high school and college, and no one has helped me. I've given up on people and I'm just trying to hold on to whatever positive thoughts I can. But my DID is fucking with me, and my ASD finds it really funny and makes me unable to deal with any of my problems. And I just can't talk to anyone about it because I'm afraid they'll think I'm so fucked up. And I just don't want to deal with my head being like this anymore.

I never got to experience teenage romance. I was always the victim of unrequited feelings. I believe that I used to be ugly. It didnâ€™t bother me back then, but since Iâ€™ve graduated Iâ€™ve been thinking so much. I never cared about my appearance the way I do now. I will always be remembered the way I used to look. Since then, I lost weight, started taking care of my appearance, and started dressing nice. Not to sound cocky or anything but I think I am quite attractive now. I just feel like I missed out on so much in my life due to being unattractive and quiet in high school. Even though I feel attractive now, in a way it seems like nothings changed. I have no social skills, insanely awkward, barely any friends, no boyfriend and always alone. I always think about how much different my life wouldve been if I looked the way I do now in high school. I probably wouldâ€™ve been able to experience teenage romance. So badly I just want to meet a guy who truly wants me. I have dreams almost every night that Iâ€™m back in high school.

"Ill try to keep this as simple as possible. Not sure where to really start but ig it really all started when covid happened. My senior year high school everything went online and sports cancelled. I didnt see people for almost a year, online learning sucked i got really depressed from that and i sat in my room all day everyday in the dark. I had no friends either, i stood up for a girl and they hated me for that and then that girl ended up backstabbing me to put it simply. I reached out to an old friend and we connected again, asked if she wanted to go to prom with me. At prom she was very rude and mean to me and ditched me which killed the night for me. College rolls around and first semester goes to shit, the worst things that could happen, happened. Since my gpa was too low i couldnt participate on the sports team till next year. Now i just started summer training for the fall and now im injured and could be out for as long as 3 months. Running is such a huge part of my life and not being able to do it really sucks. And i know this is kinda stupid but i feel it does contribute to my depression. Ive never had a girlfriend and i just really want one. I want to experience loving someone and bring loved. And theres plenty more that happened but these are the main things. Nothing seems to really excite me anymore, i dont have much motivation, im always so close go just giving up on life. Im not suicidal, i promise you that i mean just giving up as in just sitting in my room all day for the rest of my life. I know ill get out of this rut eventually because ive already gone through so much crap so it would be a waste to just give up now i guess. For right now i just want someone to talk to, male or female, i dont care about age, we can literally talk about anything. maybe if things go well we could be friends.

PS :DELETE IF NOT ALLOWED 

I was recently diagnosed with cptsd, bipolar II and bpd (borderline personality disorder) back in September 21â€™ and letâ€™s just say Iâ€™ve had one hell of a ride. Letâ€™s just start with the past 7 months. At the beginning of September after our second son was born. Got cps called the second he was born because of â€œmy past mental healthâ€ and past record of dcfs which was unfounded; forced psych pills down my throat as soon as I had him too and my younger son has Laryngomalacia and was born with the condition and they tried using that and saying that we neglected and abused him. Anyways fast forward; they found nothing got them off of our backs. Thatâ€™s not the worst to come shortly after our son gets home after staying 4 days plus in the hospital for no reason our house almost caught fire with my son and I in it while my husband was at work; we didnâ€™t know it at the time but the wiring in our home was damaged and we were renting as it was not our responsibility and could not afford it as it would cost thousands. So we were forced to move; weâ€™re now staying temporarily at my grandmothers in a small small room our cannot even fit in and he has to stay in the living room with her, then shortly after we moved in, I lost my job. That really took a mental toll on both of us and Iâ€™ve been struggling with work ever since but do not qualify for disability and now that we have money to get our own place, nowhere near me is renting until august and or will not rent to us. Weâ€™ve been here 7 months and honestly being trapped here is sucky and isnâ€™t going to work for much longer I recently started a new med called oxcarbazepine and itâ€™s working okay has anyone else had any similar experiences/ same diagnoses? And has anyone heard of this medication helping anything like these disorder I guess this is kind of a reach for help/support Iâ€™m just a stahm who loves my kids. If anyone has any advice please let me knowï¿¼. I also have another son but as like stated before dcfs got involved with him as well and long story short he is staying with my husbands mom right now.

I tried to make everything right, I went to therapy, took my medications, went on a treatment plan for my chronic diseases, ate right, worked out, and tried to change my victim mindset that is bringing me down.

 Thereâ€™s just nothing there anymore. No passionate emotions one way or the other. The only thing I remain passionate about is going to sleep and even thatâ€™s starting to become a chore instead of the luxury it used to be.

"This post is a vent. 

I am experiencing functional depression. And it sucks, it's terrible. 

I know why I am experiencing it. I have my family but I am so alone. I have my friends but no connection, I feel so alone. I have talked with my family about it, and I am getting a therapist. But I have no friends to talk too about the simple things that make me happy. Or the things that pique my interest. I play games with my closest friend but I feel so empty while doing it. 

I never experienced depression before. I never understood it before. Now I do. It's a cancer of the mind. It turns your own body against you. I feel empty, I feel nothing but sadness and fear and regret, and hopelessness. 

Depression has it's own weapons and it uses it's strongest weapon against me. Fear. Contrary to many I have seen, I am terrified of death. Not of being dead but of losing my conscience life. Of losing the ability to be myself. To be in an infinite sleep FOREVER. For an infinity to pass in a second. I am terrified of it. Sometimes I think about it so much I forget that it will happen. I have told my family but still. And depression uses it to keep me depressed. I can't enjoy anything without being taken out of it with thoughts of my loved ones dying and myself dying.

I feel empty and alone. I am trying to enjoy my time but my enjoyment is being sucked out of me because of the depression. I want friends, I want to love, I want to be loved. But a husk of a person can't love nor can they receive it. 

I love you all. I don't know where I got the love from but I love you all. Just for being here and just for experiencing what I am. Thank you. Let me continue however,

I recently watched Rick and Morty S5 E3 and it struck a chord with me for a reason I can't quite pin down.

I have been going on walks and I think I am gaining ground against depression but I can hardly do what I enjoy. All I fear is fear. All I feel is futility. You are going to die anyway so why bother doing anything? Depression is a cancer. And I feel so frustrated I cannot enjoy anything. I cannot stop death. I cannot get out of this depression. The world seems to be ending and I feel so trapped. So, so trapped. 

I never understood why people commit suicide. But if I had to live like this for so many years. I would go insane. It would be better to be dead than living like this for so many years. It's hell. Depression is a cancer. 

Thanks for providing a space to vent. I don't know if I feel much better but. Thank you.",depression_disorder

Really, who would really care? I almost see it as a positive thing, so when I die they won't lose a friend (if I'm even that). From most people I can slowly drift away without them noticing, or have superficial relationships that I can cut off at any time. 

It may cost with some people, but it's a matter of moving away from that group of friends. One of them may seek me out, so I'll slowly distance myself without harming him, and when the course is over I'll go to a different center.",depression_disorder

"Hi everyone,

I have harsh anxiety and am often depressed. I do attribute this a lot to growing up with my stepmother since I was 13. My real mother died 2 days after my 10. birthday. I am 27 now.

Growing up with my stepmother took a toll on me. She had always rules she just expected us to know.
She never told us when we ""broke"" those ""rules"", she just brought them up to our father weeks after the effect, when having fights with him.
I was called lazy by her and that I would exploit my father. I took this extremely to heart and always wanted to prove the complete opposite.
The relationship completely broke for me when she without reason falsely accused me of stealing from her.

Everyone in our family understands the issues that I have with her, but ""plays normal"" since she's still in the family. My father is a very passive person. He complains about her himself, but would not really take action.
This confuses and frustrates me a lot, but I still love my family. I want to be with them, but there is always my stepmother. When I'm there she either acts as if I don't exist or tries to complain about the smallest things that marginally have to do with me. 

I thought I had a grasp on my life again, but this easter was horrible again. I don't want to skip those events. I love the rest of my family.

How do you live with the unavoidable ""trigger"" of your depression?

"I know how it sounds. I know that my family will miss me. 
But no one else would.
Today I found out that my ex started a relationship in like...a month after we broke up and now I can't stop thinking that they never really cared abt me. I am not enough to make them want me back or to make them sad. 
I was the best gf I could ever be. And it didn't take one/two months for them to foget me and move on.

No, I don't like my ex. No, I don't want them back.
But now I feel like I never meant anything for them.
Nothing.
Maybe someone to be there so they weren't alone? 
Maybe a distraction?
But not someone they loved and now I don't believe someone can love me?

I hate them.
I hate me.
I just want to go back in time and avoid meeting them.

I feel like Iâ€™m an awful person at heart, and this is why people have left. I feel like Iâ€™m losing touch with reality and beginning to feel like like is just a thing I have to go through full of pain and sometimes happy times but I find it being more hurtful than anything. I feel like Iâ€™m not close really to my mom or my brother anymore and my father I feel like doesnâ€™t care about me anymore.

2) I have 0 intention to study or work on something yet everyone around me expects me to achieve something big. I always tell them that I hate everything and don't want to be anything yet they think I'm kidding and believe that I will always be happy and successful.

3) My parents love me but they always think I'm joking because I'm doing well in life. I always get relatively good marks in exams, eat well and play games. So, they think I'm joking whenever I mention my problems. Not just my parents, literally no one takes my mental health serious.

I have been attending, tending to funerals...
More funerals than anybody can bear,
In the coldest ways possible,
I have seen death approach them,
Why did I murder them in its stead?
Maiming them in the dark of the night,
Their children, their families, and friends,
Don't look away now, don't you dare,
You too, are equally criminal if not more,
Why hide your invisible paints now?
You do not see them, you cannot smell...
Their putrid stench, rotting away.
It fills my air, no ventilation in here, 
Their bodies are still piling up,
How many more must I burn?
How many funerals more must I attend?
Before I run out of air and asphyxiate?
In the discomfort of my own brain,
I make myself a home from their bones,
Could it still be called a home? 
If those died were parts of my own...

"As the title states. I've had depression, anxiety, substance abuse issues since I was 14. I thought life was coming together when we had my son. At him and his mother almost died. He was very very premature. 
I was raised in an abusive household. My father was a heavy alcoholic and I was very neglected. 

It all culminated and I was a miserable abusive paranoid asshole in our relationship. I did so much stupid shitni can't forgive myself for. As tesult I've had limited access to my son for years. 

I've been in therapy. I've got off substance. I feel like I've done everything I can. I'm still so in love with the mother of my child but she doesn't love me in the same way. I understand because I was abusive. I was on adderall and xanax and drinking and I wasn't a good person.

She has supported me in my struggles, she listens to me and she really wants to be friends and co-parent. She also seems to have feelings but denies it. We've had dinner, spoken for hours on the phone, even kissed only recently, which she says was a mistake.

I want to respect her, i want to do things with my son and her but I cant help but want to reconcile which she says will not happen but when we're together it feels so different. 

I don't feel like there's anyone else for me. I've dated and I can never give myself to anyone because I still love her. I don't think I'll ever love anyone like I love her and it would be disrespectful to be with anyone else when I feel like I will always love her more.

I have a good Job. I make decent money. I generally know I can meet women but I'm always held back and scared I'd meet someone else and ""miss opportunity"" with her.
Time is just passing. I'm lonely and so depressed. I miss my family and I feel like I'm in purgatory. 
I can't fix the past and I'm stuck. I don't know how to meet anyone and I can't even find myself truly attracted to anyone else. 
I even feel if I met someone with a child I'd possibly spending more time with someone else's child and betraying mine. 

I'm lost and I've almost thought there was a chance to reconcile. I love doing things with them. I love being a family. It's the only time I ever feel whole and then the time ends and in so empty. 

It's killing me. I'm so tired of being alone and I feel like I'll die this way. Maybe I deserve that. I can't see a future for me and if there's no future I just want to die now. Or hurts so much all the time.  I don't want to be here anymore",depression_disorder

It scares me to think that everyday passes and time isnâ€™t slowing down. The days months and years march defiantly onward and everyday I wake up to the same monotony and sense of unfulfilling as yesterday. 

And despite all this worry, concern and anguish, my mind still canâ€™t find the motivation or  discover a pathway thatâ€™ll lead me to kick myself into gear and remove the emptiness from my life. It canâ€™t  find a way to be happy. That to me is â€œdepressionâ€ at its root.

What is it that I am supposed to grab?

I am but a fleeting consciousness in a decomposing husk, a constantly deteriorating body and mind. With each morning desperately chasing for... ""something""... a reason? a destination? only to be overwhelmed by it all and give up for another day wasted, another unfulfilling night. The next day comes, with less time in my possession. The neuron connections in my brain slightly less established than the day before, the splicing of cells in my body slightly less accurate until eventually entropy wins. It always does.

But the sad thing is that, even given unlimited time... would I still choose to be here? 

How do I cope with this feeling? How do I stop wasting my life? or maybe deep down I want to waste it all and just be done with it if not for the feeling of guilt and the expectation that life should somewhat be meaningful.

"
Hello everyone, I'm gonna start by saying I'm very sorry if this post triggered anyone, I'm just here to talk about my experience 

I've been dealing with depression for years now and for the most part I've done a decent job hiding it from the world, until Iâ€™ve had a bad depressive episode and decided to ask for help for the second time. 

It didn't help, again. 
I've tried my best to make my breakdown as quiet as I could and to ask for help in a way that doesn't grab more attention that it should be but that didn't happen, the people Ive asked for help from freaked out because I think they didn't know how to handle the situation properly and didnâ€™t know how to handle a person with suicidal thoughts (they were the only option in my hand, trust me) and seeing the helpless look in their eyes made me feel very scared to the point that I've suppressed all my emotions and tiredness again.

I donâ€™t blame them or anyone and appreciate their effort , I know this is how they were trying to help( or this is how I like to think about it ) but their actions didn't make me feel better especially after Iâ€™ve asked for help for the first time a couple of years  ago which I've still have nightmares about it and start shacking whenever I remember events from it, I've collected all my courage to ask for help this time and it didn't help me, if anything it showed my that my family and almost all the people around me only and only cared about me acting â€œfineâ€ and not If Iâ€™m truly fineâ€¦.

I made them think Iâ€™ve been feeling better again and it took me everything to make things sort of under control for a short while until a couple weeks ago when Iâ€™ve started to feel that Iâ€™m loosing control again, I lake energy more than ever, Im always sleeping ,and Iâ€™m  having the hardest time maintaining an interest in anything in life I know my situation is getting worse and my body is giving me signs about it, Iâ€™m  scared bc I know another bad episode is coming, and itâ€™s gonna be the worst one Iâ€™ve ever dealt with,and possibly gonna truly end me. 

What makes things funny is that, my need to reach out for help is starting to fade, and Iâ€™ve stopped fighting the suicidal and thoughts in my mind, Iâ€™ve used to try to distract myself from them but now I just let them live freely in my mind and they are taking every corner in it, Iâ€™ve been having Suicidal thoughts for a while now  but just recently Iâ€™ve started to think that suicide is just normal , Iâ€™ve been thinking about it a lot every single day and kinda started to put plans againâ€¦

I donâ€™t know what to do,the smallest regular activities now seems very hard, moving from my bed is a nightmare, I feel like a part of my soul is being crushed and destroyed every day, I hate how I feel guilty for asking for help, I just want to get away from everything, I canâ€™t stand another year like that, itâ€™s been almost 6 years or so and I feel  very very exhausted , Iâ€™m turning 20 at the end of this year and I canâ€™t imagine spending my 20s,my 30s or even my 40s like that , no things will not get better for me and Iâ€™m sick and tired of people telling me they will, because they simply wonâ€™t.
each day i feel heavier and I simply canâ€™t continue fighting the same invisible monster inside my head that everyone including me tries to tell me that itâ€™s not real, asking for help was my last option and it didnâ€™t work and the only thing left is just to just stop trying .",depression_disorder
"Everyday I wake up hoping for something different, hoping that maybe something will change, someone will help me, or at least talk to me. I have friend but I dont feel that deep connection with them. I dont know what it is, but I feel like my life is falling apart. There was a point in my life when I could easily say ""yeah im hapoy"" but now I dont know if I can even crack a smile without feeling like I'm doing it to hide what's really going on. I feel lost, the people id love to talk to have either abandoned me or couldn't deal with my dwindling mental state. I can't sit there and be happy when I feel like everything is falling apart. No one talks to me, no one 3ven checks in to see how im doing, I just sit here isolated from the world. I feel like I can't even talk to someone without feeling like I'm a burden on them, sometimes I feel like I'm unwelcome, others I just don't feel like talking to anyone. Some days I just sit there and stew in my own issues, unable to think of anything else but my issues. My problems are always there, sitting in my mind waiting to drag me down again and again. Some days I can't even talk to my own family without it feeling wrong. I dont u derstand it, but thats how it feels. Im just alone, nobody there for me and nobody to talk to when im falling apart.

 Sometimes I wonder if I'm fading away from existence, slowly vanishing from the view of everyone around me. I dont know what else to do. I wasn't born rich, I wasn't born born with the genetics to look like a Greek Adonis, and I certain wasn't born with a natural ability to be social. I dont know what else to do outside of do what I know, work, pay bills, pretend im happy in the face of others, try not to let the pain leak out. Speaking of pain leaking out, its been harder to keep it in. I sit at my desk at work and I wonder when it'll end someontimes, I've often thought of death as a peace from the pain I feel everyday. I won't commit suicide, but I'm just far to riddled with pain to not view death as a peace from the current life I live. 

P.S: won't commit suicide, but I dont know, someday I wish I would die in an accident or something. Or die of a disease, something peaceful.",depression_disorder
I was thinking aloud about the decades of time my parents have lived through. The 60s up until now.

"Is that even possible with depression?

Today I sent an email to my bio parent - lately I do not care to give her the respect of calling her ""Mom"". 

I have started to set boundaries again, this time with no room for compromise when it relates to my bio parents.

Friday I was sent 3 texts from my bio-parent containing pics of my belongings that are on my ""Step-fathers"" property. With a message stating ""Been here long enough"". I responded immediately, emotionally charged, stating ""don't worry I will be there soon enough to gather my stuff and you will never have to worry about it or me again"". I admit not the worst I could do but my anxiety was through the roof none the less. I stopped and put my phone down and didn't text, call, or email for at least 48hrs.

Today I sent an email asking for some understanding and explaining my current financial situation and asking if she remembers what it's like being broke. I re read the email 3 times, checking for any misspellings and making sure I kept the conversation to the point and then hit the send button.

I informed her that while my timeline may not fit hers I stated that she can ""Do what she's gotta do"" and that I cannot stop her... \*side note - understand that if she was to have my belonging destroyed I will simply walk away and never speak to her again ... \*side note 2 - I am the only child out of 3 willing to still speak with her pending future decisions made by her.

If I could give one piece of advice - learn how to set boundaries with people. I am no professional at all. I have read a few books relating to setting boundaries and small accomplishments(baby steps). I will continue to fall down but I know I will continue to learn from my mistakes.

"Hi everyone,

I am 32m and have struggled with depression since I was a teenager. I self harmed when I was a teenager and although I try not to give a fuck, sometimes I can be self conscious about the visible scars on my arm. This has affected my self esteem throughout my life.

I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years. During our relationship I rarely felt depressed, but I think I based my self worth and happiness on the relationship and not myself. She was a great support to me but now that I am alone in life again I have been feeling very depressed! 

I have a history of alcohol and substance abuse but now I have been working on myself and for the most part quit alcohol (it's the alcohol that leads to the substances for me) because I found now that I am single dealing with a hangover/comedown makes me feel extremely depressed and low. 

In order to combat my depression I try to eat healthy and exercise regularly. 

I have never taken any antidepressants in my life, but I am wondering if people in this sub can offer advice on whether they think these could be beneficial for me?",depression_disorder
"I feel like Iâ€™m somewhat coming out of my 2-year extended stay at the Depression Hotel. I was just discharged from a six-week outpatient program to help treat my depression, anxiety and ptsd. Now Iâ€™m back at my college finishing up the undergrad degree that Iâ€™ve been pushing off for the past year. Iâ€™m socializing again and meeting new people after staying holed up in my room/bed for several months. Everything *seems* great but Iâ€™m constantly living in fear of relapsing into a terrible depression if something doesnâ€™t go right (i.e. I donâ€™t find a job in the next few months after graduation). 

I canâ€™t help but feel like I donâ€™t even know who I am anymore. Tons of people keep coming up to me asking what my next steps are after graduation and Iâ€™m honestly so afraid. And then I see that all of the rest of my friends whoâ€™ve remained high functioning are graduating, getting jobs and living seemingly good lives. I still feel stuckâ€¦..but Iâ€™m not as stuck as I used to be if that makes sense? Iâ€™m trying my best to not overwork myself or stress myself out too much because I still feel like I could get burnt out again and go right back to the dark place I was in all of 2021. 

Any tips on how to feel like a normal human being again lmfao?",depression_disorder
"pretty girls are everywhere. won't take it out on them, they are living their best lives. But it is hard to escape how much people prefer beautiful women. It's everywhere...cant throw yourself into hobbies when your hobbies are saturated with it too.
It's understandable. It's ok to love beauty.

for reference
5'8, really skinny with no boobs and no butt and masculine looking. Am Norwegian and my 17-18"" shoulders are larger than that of many men. All clothing looks awkward on me. I am a hulk and a monster. Strangers have joked about how they thought I was a guy, have been called sir a few times. A man tapped me on the shoulder when I was 18 and asked if I was male or female.

When you are not beautiful, so much of what you do is seen as cringe by default. Unattractive people enjoying their lives is seen as in invitation for mockery. I failed the only thing that seems to matter about girls. And if youre depressed, at least be beautiful while you suffer.

"Today I had a panic attack in class, which rarely ever happens and is the first time itâ€™s happened in about a year or so. It had me shaken up and so I spent the rest of the day crying, the cause of it was work.

Anyway, today was the first day where I felt myself going back into my depressive state, like the kind Iâ€™d need to be hospitalized for. I donâ€™t want to go to a hospital, I donâ€™t want to commit suicide, so I quit my job. I found that interacting with other people at my job was giving me panic attacks so I quit.

"Hi!

Trying to understand how to help my friend who I have been in contact everyday and who is having several times the feeling of wanting to shut down and being on her own. She lives with her family, so at least is not alone.

In these periods, she feels like she has no grounding, like reality has kind of disappeared, she feels like she needs to shut down and just get through.

She doesn't really understand what is going and this is fairly recent (2-3 months). 

Does anyone know what this is? Is it only depression?

And can you advice on how to support from a distance? I can't really visit her, but I keep in touch daily (in a lighter way during these periods, I send a photo or a good morning message, things like that) and sometimes send a postcard or a little gift.

She told me I shouldn't feel I have to stay around but I reassured her that I don't feel forced to stay present. But of course I don't want to impose, only help. To me it feels she needs the gentle support and love from her family and friends.",depression_disorder

"I'm almost 26 years old and in what feels like a constant brain fog. It's been this way since I was about 14. Might be worth mentioning that I'm diagnosed with autism. I have tried many different types of antidepressants, with no other effect other than getting a dry mouth and completely losing my sex drive. I am currently in therapy and I like my therapist. But I don't know if I notice any progress. I have friends, a decent family, have had many romantic relationships. But still, I just always feel like shit.

Every day is a struggle and I can't remember the last time I felt happiness. I guess I have had little ""snippets"" of feeling ok through the years but they never last very long. It is like as soon as I think I'm starting to feel better the emptiness comes back.

But it is still here, every day, and I'm starting to lose hope that it will ever get better.

" 

I appreciate beautiful things, as they are meant to be. Like some great cinematography, music, movies, photographs, nature. But, after sometime(sometimes almost instantaneously) I feel overwhelmingly irritated. Say in someplace of great scenic beauty, or a great sunset. Mind goes blank, rather everything gets jumbled up, and ironically, I end up feeling guilty about not being able to cherish enough of it. I can't enjoy that great sunset, (maybe)because as if I can't explain what makes it beautiful. This conflict... In the end, the trip(or this conflict, when I'm merely sitting) just feels like a wastage of energy.

It's as if I don't know how to cherish beauty. Again, say, while I'm watching some movie, and some beautiful scene comes up. Say for example something portraying the intricacies of some relation, or some beautiful dialogue. I find myself getting overwhelmed with emotions at first(as it is supposed to be) but then, slowly, I find myself getting restless, annoyed at how I can't exactly explain the emotion, and how I won't be able to recreate something such detailed.

**What exactly does people feel when they say they are enjoying nature**? How does one enjoy any beautiful thing? What is the anatomy of experiencing the spark of enjoyment? **What actually does go in the mind at the sight of something beautiful(Especially scenery)**? Or is enjoyment actually suspension of thought? I want the mind to go blank, to get rid of that restless feeling. **How do I induce the sensation of enjoyment?**

How do I actually enjoy solitude?

"TLDR: title. 

Iâ€™ve been in therapy for three months, meds three months too. I initially went in for severe anxiety, which has definitely reduced with the Zoloft. 

Before I didnâ€™t have depression, yeah I was sad sometimes, but definitely not depression. Now, at my most recent psychiatrist appointment, I was diagnosed with depression. I think itâ€™s been building up. Slowly Iâ€™ve been dreaded just about anything, things Iâ€™ve enjoyed for years. School has been such a burden for me, I have good grades in everything other than math, but itâ€™s the loneliness and the constant stomach aches and anxiety attacks. Even though my anxiety has gotten a little better â€” for nearly two years it was constant and severe, I could barely go outside, which made me do online school even before COVID. Now Iâ€™m back in public school. But, even now, I have no social skills, I suck at speaking to people other than teachers or people I sit by, and even that Iâ€™m not great at. Iâ€™ve thought a lot about trying self harm, thankfully I havenâ€™t, but my suicidal thoughts are so constant. I donâ€™t even know how I would do it, but I feel like itâ€™s where my life is going to end up, no matter how much I try to get better.

"I struggled to get up today, not because I was tired or wanted to lie in bed but because I was dreaming. I don't often dream and honestly usually when I do I look forward to it, this one I didn't and honestly just made my depression so much worse for the day.

I've wrote before how basically I lost someone from my life, I fell in love with her and she dropped me from her life, she's happy has a new boyfriend after telling me she wasn't ready to date. I'm not trying to paint myself as a good person in this, I'm human like everyone else and I drunk messaged her ages ago two or three times, and I know I shouldn't of even done it once, she doesn't want me and I know this now, her sister told me to never contact her again or else they will phone the police.

I hate being a hopeless romantic cause honestly when I get ditched it ruins my life, its been almost a year since we talked.

Anyway the dream wasn't anything intense or romantic or anything like that, it was honestly just us hanging out in a room laughing, talking and joking around. It was just being in her presence that I loved so much, I felt so alive instead of feeling dead like I usually do. I woke up several times and my mind and body refused to accept that real life was real and just slipped back into that dream because I felt safe and secure being around her. I still miss her and have been working so hard to move on and not think about her, hell after that dream I did the biggest mistake and went and looked at her Instagram just to see he smiling face, and boy was she radiant. I just feel like I could of gave her that and I honestly hate my life for not being the one she wanted.

I struggle to talk to woman and terrible at flirting, I'm not tall so I usually get passed on for other guys. It sucks and I just wish she would of took that chance on me.

Could be a manager if I wanted but I don't want to. Customer Service is not me at all. 

I kind of hate who I have become, I feel like I've gone so far off track from my true self I hope there is still hope for me. I don't really have any strong relationships, my reaction to the anxiety as I was growing up was to isolate myself and avoid social interaction at all costs and it became mostly a subconscious reaction like a survival instinct. My social skills are probably comparable to that of a 12 year old now.

I did go to community college and got an associates in Communications and New Media. Lived in dorms the first semester and tried to mingle but I just hated it so much and became so depressed so I started commuting for the remainder. Have been living in the parents basement pretty much my whole life. Don't feel like dating anyone if I don't even like myself, especially if I'm living in the basement.

I have two YouTube channels, one is over 100k subs and the other almost 80k. I film at local motorsports events and edit highlight videos.

"Sorry for the long post in advance, and as the title says, i would like to know a few answers to this question. 

   Ive made a lot of mistakes in life, and to this day they still haunt me, its like chains that no matter how many times i believe ive finally gotten rid of them, they come back. They range from stupid things like stealing someones candy, to not helping a sibbling when i was 7 and he was 3 from falling off the bed cuz I was pissed at him, to losing the love of my life who I was with for 7 years due to unresolved childhood trauma who messed me up so bad nd got worse when we were about to get married, this was a few years ago, and to this day is the one thing that I don't forgive myself the most. I've met other people after but they end up breaking my heart in different ways, and it really feels like I'm paying for whatever things I've done in the past, this life or any before this one.

    My psychologist says it wast my fault, I should've dealt with the issues yeah, but what's done it's done, and there isn't anything I can do to fix the past, that I am a better person than I used to be, that I'm an amazing person and should learn not to be so hard to myself, that people who I have apologized to have already forgiven me, but im the only one who hasn't forgiven himself. And honestly I don't find a way, in all of my life I have battled with severe depression and anxiety, I have poor to none self-esteem, to me, im not worth forgiving, atleast not myself, and I really don't know how to, especially when I know I lost the only chance to be happy in life due to my own actions.

   I dont know how to leave the past in the past, and it haunts me and it hurts so bad, I have tried to harm myself before, and I still get suicidal thoughts, and I try not to, but I just don't know how or if I even can forgive myself for everything I've done to this point.

Try to turn it around? Or be miserable forever? I would honestly love to hear what people have to say about this. It would make me feel hopeful about the future but Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ve already decided. Take care

"I have nothing to say
Nowhere to go 
I feel like 
All I say is wrong
Nothing seems right
Feelings donâ€™t matter
Opinions are jaded
And my way is problematic

An inconvenience, always misunderstood
I wish you could see 
I mean no harm
I just want peace
Why must it be so hectic,
When all could be fine
My feelings are simple
You seem so hateful

All that I believe
The principles I hold true
Simple things turn sour
And you in turn
Wish nothing but pain
On one who desires peace
Only simplicity
Life is short

The trivial is minute
As importance fades
Over time, feeling too
Though I wish it didnâ€™t 
Iâ€™m at a loss
I wish you could see
Maybe feel just how
Life holds no meaning",depression_disorder
"I just got my dream job making big money in my dream location. 

Iâ€™ve worked my ass off for pretty much all of my 20s in order to get to this point, and faced a lot of hardship as a women in STEM and as a person with no family.

However, I donâ€™t feel anything but numb sadness. I want to feel excited but Iâ€™m not. And Miss USA committing suicide recently has been particularly triggering; most of my thoughts lately have been suicidal. I want to be excited. Iâ€™m tired of feeling joyless.",depression_disorder

Tired of this life.. tired of myself. Tired of talking. Tired of seeing. Tired of hearing. Tired of breathing. What are we doing here? What is the point. Is it a game? Are we real?

"Hi there, I donâ€™t post often but I wanted to say this to everyone going through a tough time. 

Iâ€™ve been going through ups and downs with lifelong depression and itâ€™s been especially bad for the past few years since I graduated college. 

But one thing that I learned is that depression can be very tied to neurological disorders. Donâ€™t think that just because you feel unmotivated thatâ€™s itâ€™s all your fault or that when you feel sad that itâ€™s your fault. 

Yes, there are external factors that can make what youâ€™re going through feel worse and some things may not even change as quickly as youâ€™d like. But give yourself a break and donâ€™t blame yourself. Find professional help. If therapy doesnâ€™t work for you that fine. Try seeing a psychiatrist and maybe that will help you feel better after taking medication. But even if that doesnâ€™t work for you, donâ€™t blame yourself. 

To whoever is just passing through, we know what youâ€™re going through and what it feels like. Wish you the best in life.",depression_disorder
"Sometimes I wish I had that one friend I can visit when things get very shitty in my life. Then I realized I don't have anyone to pull through for me, to invite me over, to watch a movie, to have dinner, or to sleep over and stay up all night and just hang out and eat snacks and talk about nerd shit. All that actually ends with me having to preform some ""act"" but there is no movie, there is no dinner or sleep over or fucking snacks! Its just the same demoralizing bullshit I allowed myself to endure! Thinking I can finally escape my problems but run right into them like a deer in headlights.",depression_disorder
Currently taking Wellbutrin. Love it because it helps manage depression. AND ADD without crushing my libido.

"I recently got out of a stressful job in December 2021 but noticed I made a huge mistake financially and it's too late to turn back. It basically feels like a really bad breakup (mutual at first but then I found out I'm on the losing end of things). Long story short, it's close to impossible finding a job as high-paying as my previous one. Have been having mental breakdowns (hysterics), depression and panic attacks since Christmas 2021, am seeing a therapist and on medication.

I'm lucky as my group of friends and family are very supportive but I find the healing process painfully, frustratingly slow. On certain rare days my mind is clear and I can focus on picking myself back up and planning for the future, at the same time keeping the sadness and anxiety at bay. On certain days - today for example - I had 5 consecutive nightmares and woke up feeling extremely exhausted and sad. Didn't know who to turn to so I let my emotions out the only way I knew I could - crying. Even that felt hard and the tears wouldn't come. Just felt a huge weight on my heart and the type of emptiness I guess only we going through depression come to know very well.    

I can't see my therapist much (only once every 2 weeks) due to financial concerns and my friends are working most of the time so there's usually no one to talk to until after work. Knowing my friends have a stable income triggers deep seated feelings of insecurity and incompetence within me, which starts to whole process again. 

I just need to heal quickly so I can get back up on my feet and face the cruel hard world again but this healing is really taking too long. It's the beginning of February (1 month+ since my first attack) already and the healing process is so painfully slow. I need to get over this break up so I can move. What can I?",depression_disorder

"I just turned 30 this past September, I'm unemployed, never finished highschool, currently have no romantic interests and I have one friend in the entire world. A bit of background... I started a nasty drug habit when I was 19 because I was extremely depressed and didn't care if I lived or died and some kids at a party were doing it and put it up to my face. The next 7 years were spent on and off the streets. Just barely escaping death many times. Many times I tried to clean up and then ended up right back in the same place I was before. So many rehab attempts, detoxes, recovery plans etc. At one point it got so bad I just accepted I would be on the street for the rest of my life and was destined to beg for money or whatever until I died. I'm not sure what changed... Things just got so desperate and it seemed life had other plans for me because I finally managed to clean up completely almost 4 years ago and haven't touched a drug or drink since then. 

Anyways. The point of this post is that when I cleaned up my crippling depression came back. I haven't progressed in life at all since I cleaned up.. It is extremely hard for me to do basic things... I get so much anxiety thinking about applying for a job. It takes so much out of me just to get up and do it. Despite that I ended up getting a job a few months back and gave it everything I could... I got up every day and tried my absolute best to do well at it but it still wasn't enough because they fired me after 3 months with no explanation... I shrugged it off at first but in reality it crushed me and I slumped right back in to severe depression. I have no desire to form relationships, it is a huge effort for me to call people and try to keep up with them.. Just the thought of picking up a phone to call someone is like a hot iron going down my throat. I just can't imagine a future with anyone. I feel completely undesirable. Like why would anyone want to be with an uneducated ubderachiever like me? I've tried many things to change but every single time I end up failing... I don't know what to do... I feel like I'm destined to fail. While I don't feel like I'm at risk of going back to drugs because I am now aware that they aren't the answer for me, life is starting to feel extremely pointless. 

Even things I used to care about and was extremely passionate about like guitar/music has gone completely to the wayside. I can't bring myself to pick up an instrument anymore. As soon as I do thoughts of inadequacy and mediocrity course through my brain and I immediately have to put it back down. It feels like my brain's reward system/pleasure centers are completely destroyed. I hoped after 4 years of sobriety I would start to heal and things would get better... And while at a surface level things are better, infinitely so than when I was knee deep in my addiction underneath it all everything is actually so much worse and I feel like I'm dead inside. I don't know what to do. I can't imagine going on like this for the rest of my life. If I'm already starting to loathe myself this much at 30 years old I can only imagine how much worse it's gonna get in the next 10 years if my mental state doesn't improve. I don't know what I hope to achieve by writing this I just had to say it somewhere because it's been on my chest for a long time and there is really no one in my life I can talk to about any if this without feeling like they are judging me. 

That's all.",depression_disorder
" I just want to stop being an envious, toxic piece of s\*\*\*.  
Today, I found out that one my best friends got a great job as an airline first officer. We both are pilots, I graduated 2 years ago, and he did 1 year ago, and I can't help but feel envy for him.  
I worked my ass off in training, and I was one of the best students. But for a lot of reasons, I have not been able to get a fucking job in 2 years. I have been suffering from extreme depression and anxiety these years. I am working at a call center for pennies, everything I make is to help my dad pay the bills and to stay current with my licenses,

  
The thing that bothers me the most is that I was better than him in training, and I even helped him with a lot of subjects. Now, he's way ahead of me.

  
He managed to get the job because he was able to pay for the a320 training, which is $15.000usd. Airlines used to sponsor that, but they are now asking us to pay that ourselves before even applying for the job. They also request that applicants hold a US tourist Visa, they need to know that we are eligible to enter the US before sponsoring the Crew Visa. Guess what, I have been denied that thing twice and because of covid, the next appointment is in two years! And no, there isn't another way to get that visa. That's the only way. I'm fucked.

  
I don't have the money for the course either, so basically I'm stuck at this shitty job. I can feel my GF is getting tired of my negativity, she always says things will change, and I will eventually get hired. But all I see is a dark future. And I can really sense she's getting tired of me. I'm really trying man, I started going to therapy but nothing works, I can't see a way out of this mess I got myself into. My gf comes back from au pairing in August, and we want to move together. Of course, It will be impossible because I don't make enough to support ourselves.

  
I feel like a complete failure, I failed my family, myself and my partner. I feel like I don't deserve her. She should be with a more successful man, not with a failure like me.

  
Everyone is telling me that things will be fine. Come on! It's been two years! How much more do I have to keep waiting.

  
I am honestly tired of studying my subjects, practicing in simulators and staying current. There's no point in that. The only way for me to even apply for a job is getting the US visa and $15.000usd for the course. I don't think I can make it.

  
I see my gf will eventually leave, and I'll fall deeper in my misery, but she deserves more than me. I'm a mess and a failure. And It's not like I have not fought for this. I did, and I have been for a long time. But it's like live does not want me to be happy, to achieve my dreams. I love my gf I want to give her everything, and have a comfortable life with her, but It seems It won't happen.

  
My high school friends are also getting nice paying jobs, moving together with their partners, and I just makes me more miserable, I can't help but compare myself to them, It is inevitable.  
It is not fair, I have fought for this. Why can't I have what I want, just want to be happy",depression_disorder
"You know, my family is... there. We love each other, but things certainly don't go as any of those imaginations of united families going to the park or having dinner in a table everyone together. 

We are so close, yet so distant. What I mean is, I see them everyday, and we recently got 'united' by something major (grandma's sickness), but before that we were so fuckin' distant. I mean we could go for a day exchanging a couple of words and that would go as a normal day. My family members, are by no mean ""introverts"" or anything of the sort, by the contrary, they are very charismatic. Not all days were like these, but you get what I meant. Even now, things go can go cold pretty easily. It's not awkward, we have the same blood, we love each other. The frustation hits in and it's just cold.

My father wasn't there much growing up, that's why I'm not **very** close to my dad family side, I catched up a lot 5 years from then, and I love them so much. But you know how it is. I barely have childhood memories with them, and this breaks me whenever I see them. Something's missing.

My mother was there, kinda. But she was busy with work and when not in work she was going out. Dating and what not. I never got much attention from her as her boyfriends had, until this day. Growing up this made me very rebellious towards mother figure, maturing with pain I just realized what this all was. I simply wanted her to love me and show interest in me, support me. I remember I had to figure shit out and get shit by myself, you know people talk big when they do this and they feel fullfilled and I completely get why, but I feel the opposite, I feel empty. She doesn't even know my interests, and don't remeber if i'm 18 or 19. A lot of times she doesn't act like an adult at all, even reminding me of girls younger than me. But I can't bring myself to debate any futher. Shit is what it is. She is my mother, and I love her. What can I do? Too late for change.

Fuck. My youngest uncle fuckin' married at 16 years old and put his shit together. I admire him so much because he is genuinely what I see as a man. If he was my father I feel like I would be the luckiest child in the entire earth. I honestly feel like he can do anything. The irony of it all is that he can't have sons. Maybe he can, but my auntie can't, and she is exactly like him personality-wise. I don't even wonder why he engaged so fast and is with her until this day. I admire them so much. They are my gems, my bit of hope.

My uncle from the middle is known and appreciated by everyone. He has a incredible charisma and pursued his dreams at also a very young age, he has a family now and even though his wife tried to take everything from him, he's still cheerful and keeping his head up trying to live a honest life as a single father.

My grandma... I have no words. How can you describe love? Theres too much sides to it, during History a lot of people tried it their own take on it, I'm sure someone have said it best than I ever could. But I don't know If it is even as close as what I feel.

I'm 19 and something boy. No direction. Never a girlfriend. Still haven't figure out what to do with his life. Through my life some people called me 'talented', 'prodigy' and even 'blessed'. I feel nothing. Even if at some point I was any of this, it is going to waste.

I love my family so much, they are all that I have. I want them to be happy, I want to protect them. I can't bring myself to ever be honest with them. They have been through so much in their life, what have I been through compared to any of them? Absolutely nothing. I dont have reasons to complaim. I didn't have the best enviroment growing up, so what? They were trying to figure shit out, just like I had to.

But damn, my grandma is really not in a good state. I don't know anymore, you know? I think some people perceive me as tough, but I honestly just wish I could cry. and cry. and cry. Cry a river. Cry all of this emptiness out of me. Fuck, you guys, I cannot cry. I can't. It doesn't come out.

I don't know anymore. I never in my life thought about suicide, and I still don't. But I feel like I'm going in a very dark ride from now on, you know when your general sadness start to materialize into something else, like your mind is trying to protect you? I feel cold. And it tastes bitter.

Good luck, all of you. May God bless us all.

"This is really hard to describe but a lot of the time I feel like my brain is fuzzy or theres a brick wall blocking it. My head where my ears are starts to feel like that too. Its like im holding something back, because it makes me feel like I could scream or just start crying, except I can't. I always feel like I could start sobbing. I can visualize myself doing it and it seems so easy, but I can never bring myself to actually cry. I've been bored everyday for as long as I can remember and I can't really tell the difference between bored and sad or if its both. I catch myself just staring at nothing and it sorta feels like life is a dream, like ""how is this stuff existing right now?"" and its weird. It doesn't last too long, though, but it happens frequently. What can I do about this? My brain is a total mess.

34, had to move back home after my marriage crapped out. We were not right for each other and we both knew it. He was lonely and settled for anyone, he was the first person who ever showed an interest in me and I latched on. Back to being a burden on my family.

Father died last year just after fathers day. Now I might live another 50+ years on this planet and he won't be here for any of it.

No friends since my teens, and even then they were friends of convienience that rejected me. Literally told to leave as I was not wanted. Everyone I have tried to make friends with since has ghosted me the moment I stopped initiating contact. Never the one being contacted.

I dont know how to be a person. I work my job because....whats the alternative? Even worse poverty and making my surviving parent want to end it all?

Tried meeting people again recently for the hundredth time. Ghosted. Tried being chatty. Ghosted. Tried being patient and not overbearing. Ghosted. Tried finding no strings attached sex so they wouldnt feel like theres any commitment to me at all. Ghosted.

What is the point of life? I scream and nobody cares. Nobody listens. My existence is ignored day in and day out.

I want this constant pain I've been in since my teens to end. Don't worry about posting empty platitudes to make sure everyone can see you're a good person as I'm not going to do anything.

i started eating whole foods, working out, studying a ton for my classes. 

but then i crashed. im sitting in a pile of dirty laundry scattered throughout my house that i havent cleaned in days. i havent worked out or eaten anything nutritious in a week, i stopped trying in my classes, i sleep through every responsibility and obligation etc. im back to where i started. all that for nothing.

i just want to LEAVE. i hate it here. so fucking much. i hate hearing my stepdad tell my mom to shut up all the time. i hate all of his shitty remarks. i hate him making my mom go buy him beer all the time. i hate him spending the majority of our already small amount of money on beer. that's just some of it. he's a narcissistic, manipulative asshole who thinks he's christ.

it's sad that the best time my mom and i have is when he's not home, he's asleep, or when we take the dogs out. the lack of him always feels so damn relieving. 

and he's not a totally bad person. he's done many good things for my mom and i. he's had his own share of struggles. but i'm at the point where i don't give a fuck what he's done for us or what he's been through. all he does is sit on his ass and play videogames all day and watch youtube and drink. he always has something shitty to say. he always makes sure he gets his way. he always talks about how he's running shit and how everything he says is right. he loves to put us down. he loves to constantly, purposely annoy us. oh, and he pisses himself and leaves the piss clothes on the floor. he has my mom wash them. he also leaves empty beer cans all over the place. my mom cleans that too.

like i said before, that's just some of it. 

i just want to go away. i want HIM to go away. i told him earlier that him leaving would be a gift from god, and i completely meant it. if i was capable, i would go somewhere else. but i'm not. to sum it up, me trying to exist on my own in the world would be like tossing a newborn kitten on the side of the road. truly. i am trying to get help though. for my depression, anxiety, likely autism. monday i'm going to a clinic. really i should've done that years ago, but better late than never i guess.

"I have come to realize that I am the person everyone can easily forget about. I started to realize that no one really like me starting back in middle school. When students would pick teams for gym class or intramurals I wasnt even picked. I would be the last one standing and the teams would start to disperse hoping that they didnt get stuck with me. The gym teacher would then tell me what team to go to and everyone would push my to the back or ignore me. I tried to stay social and make friends. I went to every dance and usually ended up standing by myself, no one would talk to me. By the time I left high school I had one maybe two friends, but that didnt last long. 

I moved out of state with the intention of a new start. And I ended up where I started. So I moved again and then again. Never had any person sad to see me go. 

Now I am just shy of 40. I have no friends. I have a few people who are like ""friends"", but they have never even given me their phone numbers...so that says it all. I have a phone and can go six months without a phone call unless its a telemarketer. Occasionally i will get a fb message from someone with a ""oh hi how are you"" and then it turns into them asking a favor. Then I dont hear from them again. My 16th birthday no one showed, 21st no one showed, 30th no one showed, almost my 40th and I am not even bothering. Even my bf's friends dont like me. And it is not in my head, one of the friends actually messaged me and told me that he nor any of the friends like me. So it has put a strain on my relationship since because now when his friends have events he goes and I stay home. You always hear people say that if I die no one will notice, for me that is most likely true. I moved and no one noticed for over a year. I am the person who finds out about birthday parties and social events after people post their pics online, never invited. Even co workers have organized events and no one invited me.

I donâ€™t have an active schedule so, I just do my assignments/study when I feel like it regardless of the day/time. I still have no idea what I want to major in since I changed it 2 years ago to undecided. Iâ€™m just hoping I can figure it out this semester or in the fall, trying to graduate as soon as possible with a degree in something.",depression_disorder

"It's been a year, 7 months and almost 2 weeks since I lost my best friend. She was the person I turned too for anything and everything. I had her back as much as she had mine. I was her caretaker since I was 12, and she was my caretaker since day one. She did her best to raise my brother and I, my dad was in the picture but he was a distant provider. 

Now that she's gone, I feel the depression and loneliness are holding me back from being a better me. My brother hates me and wished that I was dead, if anything my dads happy that he doesn't have to deal with my mom, and all my other relatives and friends are doing their own thing. I get excluded from stuff often, that I don't mind excluding myself voluntarily when I do get invited. I know a person who's feeling low can be a stick in the mud, but I tend to hide my emotions well and keep to myself.

I got out of a toxic relationship, it was ok for the first 4 months. I met her a month before my mom's passing, and she was really supportive and checked up on me. But it's been hell the last few months, she has ptsd and has a substance abuse problem. The last month has been real lonely, I slowly worked on ending the relationship on the best terms possible. We basically split yesterday.

I'm grateful for all the people that helped me. One of my uncles lent me a car to get to work (it broke down and repairs were too expensive), I have food on the table, a roof over my head, and kind strangers who helped me when I was struggling. I was selling my collection little by little when I had an opportunity, to pay my phone bill and eat something every other day. When the holidays came I couldn't manage to sell anything, I didn't eat much. That's when I posted my infamous bowl of Torn, tuna and corn. I received a lot of help from a bunch of strangers, it kept me going through the month and I still have some leftover for 2 phone bills. 

Keeping a job is damn near impossible, that's why I started doing deliveries through doordash and instacart. That came to a sudden stop when the car broke down. I started doing deliveries the 2nd week of January, I do 2 or 3 orders on with my dads van on weekend mornings. He doesn't know what I do, tbh he probably thinks I go for walks or something. 

I have looked for professional help, especially after I landed in ER and a psych ward for attempting. I'm receiving foodstamps now, looking into housing, and taking care of my mental health before I land another job that I can't keep. But lately the loneliness has been bringing me down. 

Besides hanging out with my mom. The only thing I was into helped me distract myself. Collecting and selling action figures/toys/collectibles/dolls (whatever you want to call them) its an expensive hobby. I bought one as my Christmas present, but it was 2 or 3 months before the actual holiday. I reboxed it and wrapped it up. 

This last week I decided that I should take a trip for my birthday. It's a one way ticket kind of thing.",depression_disorder

The two most important people in my life forgot me. and i know it's highschool and whatever yadda yadda but I'm already so fucked up, i can barely function anymore and ive been having constant panic attacks for weeks. and here i am sitting alone in my room watching a show on my computer feeling like shit because i didnt get all my school work done and im stressed out my mother fucking mind, and i find out ive been forgotten by the two people I love most. my boyfriend and i have literally talked about going to a basketball game and I'd ask him all the time, and he finally goes to one..",depression_disorder

"Let me preface this by saying that I am not ok. I am mentally unwell, my therapist (who I see every monday) is fully aware of my situation. I am on meds, but I've just started on meds and we are still trying to figure things out. I'm also physically unwell, migraines have become rapidly uncontrollable and debilitating in the last year, I'm on a small child's shoebox of meds I take each day to control them (not including the shots) and it's not working. The meds are slowing attacking other organs and we are unsure and kinda don't care about the extent of the damage right now, just trying to gain control of the migraines, which we (my neurologist and I) still have no idea why they are happening. I also should disclose I have Bipolar 2, Anxiety, Depression, BPD, OCD, and PTSD. I'm in my thirties, with three children, taking care of my medically disabled husband. I don't work and wouldn't be able to, since I need to care for him. We have tried to get him a nurse, but that isn't something he is comfortable with, he prefers me, because of his own issues that I won't list here. My own health is slowly deteriorating, so I'm trying to get a second opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main issue is feeling/finding fulfillment in life. I'm always depressed enough to want to take my life, or at least apathetic enough to feel like I don't care to be on this planet anymore. (Obligatory statement: I'm safe, I'm with safe people, in a safe location, with no access to sharp or bang-bangy objects) I've tried every hobby that I could afford, I've travelled a little within the US while I was younger, I've drank, I've slept around, I've stolen, I've settled down, now I'm sick and nothing has ever fit. I just have always felt empty. I'm basically the jack of all trades, but the master of none. I can crochet a little, paint a little, sing you a diddy, sculpt you a figurine for your desk, whatever you need me to do, except make myself content. I just want to feel alive without the wind in my hair and the car going 90 miles an hour down a country road. I keep trying to live out any other life I can in any video game I can afford in the spare moments I can muster in the day when I'm not taking care of my family or the house or shut down by a migraine, but I don't even want that anymore. Hell, I even did belly-dancing lessons for a while until I ran out of money. I just wish death would come and slip his cool hand into my brain and stop these lightning bolts for once and all. I want to feel my hands again and taste drinks and be hungry like everyone else. I'm so tired. I actually wish I was dying and not just suffering alive, this is madness. 

&amp;#x200B;

I kinda venting and begging for help. What do you do when you tried everything else? My therapist is just trying to keep me stable while I cope with the pain. I paid for a creative writing class as a last ditch effort since I've always wanted to write a book, but after this, there's nothing left. What then? I can't drink myself into a stupor, my meds won't work then. I feel so hopeless. I've been depressed for over 20 years and I just can't anymore. Between it and the migraines, I'm losing the battle. My therapist knows and he's saddened by this news. I'll even show him this post Monday when I see him, so no one gets their feathers ruffled. I just need some help.",depression_disorder

He didnâ€™t want me to sleep over and asked if he should Uber me home or if I could walk but I said I would rather walk. It was the loneliest walk Iâ€™ve ever had.

"How do I cope knowing I'll never truly be happy with myself or things I do? I never feel good enough when so many people say I am or that I matter. I just feel so worthless all the damn time. 

I look at myself and just see nothing good. No one would want to love me or even befriend me. One thing that really gets me is seeing so many beautiful women, knowing I'll never stand a chance with. I'm so lonely and want to just believe her words when she says I'm enough or that she loves me...but no, I'm alone. It hurts being invisible to everyone.

I just feel so trapped in things I will never achieve. It's draining when half the time I'm not even trying to think them but seeing something triggers it. Everyday objects, people, anything triggers it. I'm just so tired of myself.

I'm fucking hurting here and its up to me to stop the pain but I just don't know how to actually care enough to do so. I'm 23 years old, why should being single or unemployed affect me like it is?

"I (F30) am barely able to keep my head above water. I have recently relocated to the US with my husband, because that was his dream. I have never felt so lonely. Ever!! I suffer from depression and crippling anxiety since 2017, lost my mother my best friend after a cardiac surgery, 2 years later my father who was pretty much all i had succumbed to covid. My brother took this as an opportunity to remove my name from all family assets and put me through a year long trauma of harassment. I survived on my own. I met my husband during this time And we got married a few months ago. I really thought i had SOMEONE finally whom i could count on. But he has hurt me numerous times. He snitches on me. He will go and narrate every damn thing to his parents. He tattle tells on me soooo much. I cant trust him with ANYTHING. He makes fun of my insecurities. I had got a rhinoplasty done to fix my nose and he outed me in front of his parents telling them i had a nose job. I still cant forgive him for this. He laughs when i cry. He tells me i should be thankul to him and his family for accepting a girl like me with no family. There is constant pressure on me to earn. Though he earns pretty well. Compares me to his friends wives with good careers. And i always try to make him understand how difficult my situation was. He says stop using your tragedy as excuses. I do my best. Each day every day every moment is a struggle for me. I never let it show. I never talk about it. Because he will just go and tell his family what a thankless bitch i am. I do my best. Take good care of the house take good care of him, but the moment i place my view on things, he will make me feel inadequate and tell me to shut up. Because i dont make money. I miss my parents every day and only someone who has lost both their parents at a young age can know how much this kills. I am alone and have absolutely no one to talk to. I am scared as i write this by just thinking about facing tomorrow and going through the same pain. Im tired of this constant pressure in my chest.

recently I talked about plans beyond work (she hikes alone with her dog) but she seemed to be on the fence, oh well. I asked how her dog like the trail and I didn't hear back on Sunday, figured she's resting from the day off. still don't hear anything Monday... uh ok.

she's also off Tues and Wed, and nothing. Oh well. Thursday she closes while I open so there's about 15 minutes of overlap. She says hi/good morning, and I'm a little mad at her?

"I have cold/flu symptoms right now.  Nothing serious.  Lots of congestion, bad headache, cough and tired. 

I feel so bad when days and days go by and I haven't gotten what I needed to get done done. I feel bad about myself and have anxiety because I need to work etc. But being sick means I don't have to be productive.  Society says it's OK to take it easy if you're physically ill when you have observable or measurable symptoms. I don't have to be mad at myself for not getting as much as I should done. It's a peaceful feeling. There's a reason I'm not doing stuff. It's not that I'm a lazy, depressed, and defective. I'm sick. 

Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm sick or depressed. They feel similar to me. I only know for sure when I have observable or measurable symptoms. 

Before Covid I worked at a business (now I work for myself from home). I called in sick to work zero times in over a decade. Going to work sick or injured is usually much easier than going to work when having bad depression or anxiety. Broken bone, lost voice, cant stop coughing (pre-Covid), day after surgery (when you're supposed to stay in bed and not move for a week) etc easier than a depressed day. Much, much easier. 

I really felt like this when I had Covid. I got tested. I'm positive. I even have a piece of paper to prove it. I'm supposed to stay home and take it easy. It's allowed. I had ""permission"" to not get anything done. It felt really good. 

I wish there was a test for depression. Not a self reported one. A medical test that measures something.  Something you could show people. My sister is really condescending. She just likes to think I'm a loser. Maybe I am.",depression_disorder

 I just hate that everyday it feels like a chore. I procrastinate until its late at night. i look at my drawings and I hate them. I hate them so much. I hate that I lost some of my skill. I hate that I dont have an established style.
 How is it that ive been drawing for 14+ plus years and still haven't gotten better? I just hate everything I do. I dont know why I choose to lay in bed than actually be productive.

"I have been having this lingering depression for a very long time. Living is such a pain. I hate my parents that gave birth to me just to suffer. Every little things irritates me. Watching the news just make me hate life even more.  I hate myself that I cannot just end it all.

I have tried ""my best"" to make things better but it is never enough.

* I have tried connect to my ""friends"" but they just left me on read. I don't know what did I do wrong. I just casually asked how things going on their side - no response. I just shared things I did with them - no response. I tried to keep the group chats active but there is no response.
* I have tried connect to new people but all ever get was either someone inviting me to join their religion thingy which I tried but found any emotional/spiritual connection with them. The more I involve, the more I hate about them. Even worse they are a lot trying to lure me in this NFT or their pyramid scheme, humanity is such a mistake. There are some normal people but eventually they ghosted me like my friend. I don't know what I did wrong, I have never be any negative with them.
* The games that I once enjoyed ended up feel like a chore to me to kill my lonely time. I felt worse every time I finished playing, it felt so meaningless and make me question my life even more. I tried a few new games but nothing make me feel better. Everything feel like a chore to make time pass a little bit faster at this point.
* I have tried watching movies/series but nothing really interests me. I ended up switch the shows even before finish the first few episodes every time. Now it also feels like a chore to kill time as well.
* Travelling to different places used to be fun but it is getting repetitive and less and less fun. Now I cannot even afford it anymore. I have to grind so hard to get enough money to do that and that does not feel worth it anymore.
* I still enjoy eating good food but now I diagnose with high cholesterol and risk to have some other diseases so I could not eat things I like anymore. Why it is so hard to keep the little things you like going?
* I have tried doing absolutely nothing but that does not really make me feel any better.

Honestly, I do not know what to do anymore. I just wish assisted suicide is more accessible. Why do you even want to keep this non-functional and unhappy people like me alive??",depression_disorder

Then there's just this moment of getting a sudden intrusive thought by one of them...

""Maybe YOU don't get it?! You literally have everyone in your life telling you you're worthy of love, how unfairly you've been treated and don't deserve yet you still think everyone is wrong and doesn't understand. Maybe you don't understand?! You might be wrong about this???""

"My long distance boyfriend (26yo) has depression, he's been feeling lower than usual this week and I don't know what I could do to help him. 

Last year (before we got together) when his brother told him he was having a child, he was at a really low point and considered making him a life insurance for their future baby so he would end it after a while and the baby would have the money. It didn't happen and he got a little better, but ever since the baby was born (last week) he's been feeling really low again, and I'm not sure what I could do to help. He's meeting his niece tomorrow but he's feeling really low.

I also asked him for his address to send him a package and a letter, but he made a big deal out of it - told me to save the money, buy myself a nice dress, or something like that. I asked him why he was avoiding it and he said he understands why I got upset, but he's afraid I'm going to think less of him. I don't understand what he could possibly mean by that, he said we would talk today but he was gone the whole day, he's coming back in about 20 minutes so we will finally talk for a bit - but it's late here and I work early tomorrow, it's even later for him as he's a couple hours ahead of me.

"Iâ€™m pretty young but for the vast majority of my life I did not have friends. In my elementary school days I had like 2 friends and they were just in school friends. In the 7th is when I finally started to gain a solid friend group though still not out of school (besides on ps4)


That summer it was the height of quarantine. Didnâ€™t change much for me at all didnâ€™t do shit but rot away in my house every other summer. But I had decided to get back on ps4 even though I was horrified to talk to them again. We chatted and they were happy enough to see me which was cool. Then I didnâ€™t get on for a while. 

When I decided to get on again they were really happy to hear from me again. This was the first time in my entire life where people outside of my family were happy to hear from me. This made me so happy I actually cried that night for what felt like hours.

8th grade sucked really bad even when I went back to school in school most people thought I was weird. Looking back I donâ€™t blame them but now that some people liked me this hit really fucking hard. This drilled into my head that I was just a worthless piece of shit. This was when I started to really consider suicide and started slamming my head into things or punching myself. 

That next summer though I joined the community pool and this summer was and probably still is the highlight of my entire life. Besides the girls there with some minor exceptions I was very well liked in my eyes and even invited to hang out other times outside of the pool.

The 9th started out rocky getting used to it but quickly became amazing. I was meeting new people, hanging out outside of school, and going to school events. If there ever were a time in my entire life that I felt confident In myself even as minor as it was. 

Than a group of girls I knew semi well called me creepy for reason never given probably how I look because Iâ€™ve been said I looked like among many other things autistic, a stoner, a pedophile, and worse than all a school shooter. Now I must stress that while I have a kinda fucked up sense of humor I did not say anything sexual or edgy around them. This really fucked me up.

This is when a big concern about girls came up to me. I was never confident with girls before but it has dawned on me that I will most likely never have a relationship with anyone. Iâ€™m not hideously ugly just kinda creepy looking I will most likely lose my virginity somehow someway. But all the girls that I thought liked me even just platonically donâ€™t talk to me anymore.

This has snowballed into all of my friends not hanging out with me anymore even when I ask them to hang out with me the last time I hung out with them they didnâ€™t want me to. Come at first and I now believe they only let me come cause they felt. 

I mean my quality of life has went so downhill so fast and I have to get a fucking therapist again costing my god forsaken parents even more money. If I have to live my high school out as a social outcast I would rather kill myself itâ€™s all I can think about now Iâ€™m becoming so resentful Iâ€™m taking it out at my family Iâ€™m such a piece of fucking shit I wanna do it now but my family canâ€™t take more of bullshit so Iâ€™m thinking of killing myself sometime this summer with out them around Iâ€™ve already started rough drafts on my suicide note.",depression_disorder

"I would like to preface this by saying that I am in a safe space and have spoken to my SO about this, but I feel the need to talk about it more.

I recently received some very relieving medical news, which made me incredibly happy. Then I decided to check up on some old friends just to find out that my childhood best friend recently got married. Had I not decided to seclude myself from everyone including him a few years ago, I likely would have been his best man. This made me think about a lot of the choices I've made, and I started to seriously regret cutting him out of my life. Obviously I have regrets about our relationship and other things, but then I began to spiral and second-guess recent decisions and think where I could be had I done something else, and thinking that if I do this or that now, it could fix this or that. Since this series of thoughts, I have been in one of the worst depression states I've been in in a year or so. It only took 2 days for me to go from glowing with happiness to incredibly depressed again, and all I can really think about this is how much further the fall feels when you're happy.

I guess I never really came to terms with our relationship ending, and seeing that I missed such an important event solidified the end and made me think about how many mistakes I've made in my life.

If anyone has any advise as to how to handle this sort of spiraling or coping with things such as this, that would be greatly appreciated.",depression_disorder

I knew ever since I was young that I was not the sharpest tool in the shed but life just kept getting worse and worse for me. The only person that seem to truly care about me (grandfather) passed away and now I'm surrounded by people who just have me here just because. Life just feels like hell and I wish I could just sleep forever since even my sibling's words seem to be filled with insults and this applies to all my family members, especially my mom. I was truly not the smartest nor the most handsome person in the family but I am the oldest so I can understand that they expect a lot from me. However, I wish they could figure out that I would do my best if I would for one day stop getting insulted for anything I do.

Itâ€™s been 5 year since I was diagnose with generalize anxiety and clinical depression. I had take many different medication and therapy (currently on a high daily dosis of Effexor) but I still have very low energy and motivation all the time. 
This last years have been so gray, so silent, totally drowned in nothingness. I thought that maybe by traveling i would felt motivated and occupied again, but guess It didnâ€™t.
The first days were like leaving depression in my home without telling were I was going with the hope it didnâ€™t find me. But it manage to find the way anyway. No matter where I go, it always follows me. I canâ€™t scape. I feel so trap.

The feeling you would have after doing something you know Zou will regret later. Or a bit like the tension in a horror movie when you know a jump scare is coming, but not exactly when. But there is no reason. There no external thing I can change to not feel this way. It is just constantly there this feeling, making life harder in the good times an making life unbearable in Bad times.
I just want this feeling to stop put it has been her for the last few years now, getting better and getting worse but never quite going away. And it's just so painful. 

I really want to start therapy, but it is so hard to find spots where I live that I can afford. And it might stupid bit it is always so hard for me to look for it. Because looking for help means accepting I can't quite handle it myself. I don't even know if it's that, but it has always been mentally hard for me to look for therapy. My family is really not a fan of therapy, that is certainly a part of it. They don't really believe in mental illness existing unless something big is happening. And I am good at still functioning. But it's just so painful.


I have also been thinking about approaching a doctor for medical help but that is also such a scary concept to me. I don't want to feel better because I am taking some pill, that seems little better then fixing my problems by taking drugs. And also like just such a temporary solution.


I don't really know what my point is here, except that I would really like to have someone I could talk with about my proplems on a regular basis that is not one of my family or friends. And I wanted to ask if any of you guys would be up for that? I know it's not as good as therapy, but it might be the best I can get right now.

"Just to clarify, I have had positive moments in my life, such as having passed my driving test, having family who love me, but that's just a small portion of my life; the rest is just anxiety, pain, humiliation and hating life. I'm 22 by the way. 

My whole life I have suffered from feeling not good enough for anything or anyone, plus I was diagnosed with a mitochondrial disease where I get tired extremely easily; the way I best describe this condition is basically, you imagine walking with a 20 kg army backpack over your shoulders; this is basically how I feel like all the time and I can't ever take off this figurative backpack. Also, every time I am surrounded by my peers, I am overwhelmed with feelings of shame for not being able to carry a conversation as eloquently and smoothly as they do. I don't have charisma, I'm not funny and plus, I have never had a relationship of any kind due to what I presume to be, extreme social anxiety and lack of personality. I desire so much to be charismatic and interesting enough for people and to be excellent in some way but in absolutely everything I do, I'm either below average or at the absolute best, just average. Never good, never great, never excellent, just meh. I want people to stop ignoring me, I want to stop trying so hard to be cool, liked and noticed by other people.",depression_disorder
"I'm not really sure where else to turn at this point, I just kind of need to get this out there. I haven't struggled with my depression like this since I got out of my last relationship which was back in 2019. I have borderline personality disorder and am super used to mood fluctuations of this manner and feeling this bad but usually for short periods of time before I bounce into mania again ( oh the joy of bpd mood swings ). I'm kind of going through a lot of interpersonal stuff with my friendships and new financial stress. I'm getting bad enough that I'm struggling to get stuff done throughout the day again which makes me feel worse because I know it needs to be done but I just cannot make myself get up to do it. I either eat too little or too much because most of the time I really don't have the energy to go make myself food. I barely have the energy to go to the bathroom honesty. 

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like my friends just don't care even though I know that's unreasonable and they've got lives of their own, they can't be there 24/7 ofc, but I still can't stop just how grossly lonely I feel a lot of the time, at night it's the worst cause no one is awake and I'm kind of forced to be by myself. I really wanna get back into therapy but it's expensive and I'm not really in the best place financially to afford it so I'm just doing what I can and taking my meds, basically trying to get through the days and hope this staves off soon. But yeah, I feel really miserable and life just sucks right now. I guess I'm just sort of asking for maybe a hopeful reply or two?

"Iâ€™ve started taking antidepressants again after 3 years progressively going downhill.

"I really need support. I (30f) have been seeing someone (37m)  for a few months now (this person was a friend to put it loosely). Anyway, after over a month into the relationship (which he refused to put a title on us), he revealed he has a 2 year old child and another on the way. I was shocked, but told him I understand bc I have a young child too. I told him itâ€™s ok. He assured me he wasnâ€™t with the childrenâ€™s mother. Then it turned into me finding out that he is married (more on this later). And lastly, I just found out sheâ€™s living with him (he lives with his parents and apparently she does too)! Iâ€™m hurting so badly because I would never have gotten involved with him if I knew he was married in the first place let alone them living together. He told me she thinks they are together by the way (duh). So obviously I was crushed. I went to lunch with a friend who felt sad for me and looked him up (I never did that). We saw they have been married since at least 2014. Additionally, they have a baby registry together too for this new baby on the way. So yesterday after all of this I texted him how heâ€™s lied so much to me and has hurt me so bad. I was upset. 

My feelings are so deeply involved but I know the whole thing is wrong. He ended up hardly talking to me yesterday, I tried calling last night he said we would talk tomorrow (today) and shut his phone off. Today we spoke and he said because of the way my friend â€œlooked him upâ€ (Google), and how there is so much drama and headache with me that we can no longer be an â€œusâ€ (we never had a label on it). Heâ€™s set in stone that Iâ€™m too emotional and he canâ€™t see me cry in front of him and that he canâ€™t be there for me when I need him (too much drama). I KNOW heâ€™s not right for me and my god Iâ€™d never want to hurt another woman. The issue is how involved my feelings are. I sincerely love this guy and I donâ€™t know how to navigate this. Iâ€™m so heartbroken, canâ€™t eat, canâ€™t sleep etc. Iâ€™m sad that itâ€™s become my fault that he ended it bc of me bringing up his lies to him (Iâ€™ve done it multiple times, but I guess yesterday through him over the edge). I knew it needed to end, but I just wish it wasnâ€™t my fault that it did. I think the most crushing thing he said was â€œthings will never be the same between us.â€ He told me that me calling last night really solidified that. 

Please someone help me get through this. I have been married, divorced and in relationships but have never felt a pain like this. Itâ€™s physical and my eyes are raw from crying. I feel like I fuck everything up and I feel like such trash for being the side piece and not knowing the truth. I never would have let it get this far if I knew they were together. He claims heâ€™s going to file for divorce after the baby comes, but I canâ€™t wait for that and I need to heal. Someone please give me some insight. Am I wrong? I feel like itâ€™s pretty normal to be so upset over this. ðŸ˜ž

"I just want to rant a bit. For some reason I feel a bit lower than usual, and just wanted to let my feelings go.

For starters, I had not too long ago finished a BS in Computer Science. I never really felt like I belonged in that program. Growing up, I really enjoyed math classes and solving logic problems, and I enjoyed those aspects of the degree. But I don't really enjoy the actual work of Computer Science, what goes into Software Engineering and learning to work with programming languages. It felt overwhelming to me and I never felt passionate about any of it. I never really applied myself during my degree. I never did any internships and I passed my classes but never had any really good work to show for it.

The only thing I did find myself enjoying was working in IT. I worked part time in a help desk role and really enjoyed working with technology in an easier way. Working in IT seems like something I would enjoy, but I feel like I am falling behind in being an eligible candidate for IT jobs.

So basically I spent 4 years in a undergraduate program I was miserable in (which is it's own long story), and came out of the program with a potential idea of what I wanted to do (IT), but I can't help but feel I have wasted so much time pretending to be someone I was not. When I graduated in January 2021, I applied to both IT and Software Engineering jobs. I was still unsure of myself, and there was a part of me that felt I should use my programming knowledge for it not to go to waste, but also a part of me that wanted to start fresh an IT. Either way, I didn't feel like a great candidate and could not get a decent job. I ended up giving up after hundreds of failed applications and picked up a part-time job at Best Buy as a repair technician just to feel like I have something.

I weirdly love my job at Best Buy. I genuinely like helping people there and love my coworkers. It's just that Best Buy corporate won't let me work with fulltime benefits, even if I put in fulltime hours, so I know I can't be there forever. So I have cut my hours back and started to apply to jobs elsewhere, but I am starting to feel like trash again. I'm remembering how it felt applying to jobs last year and how it left me feeling like a broken mess, and I feel just as broken now. I honestly don't know what positions I am passionate about anymore. I live at my parents house and am afraid to go to another city to do a job that I may feel like shit doing. Job searching sucks, and I feel like my self esteem drops more and more as I continue to look for jobs I don't feel qualified doing.

"Iâ€™ve struggled with anorexia since I was in seventh grade, Iâ€™m now a Sophomore in high school, and Iâ€™m tired of being tired all the time. Iâ€™m tired of my body not giving me normal cues to eat. Iâ€™m tired of feeling nauseous at the thought of eating. Iâ€™m tired of not being able to imagine eating three meals in a day, most the time I only eat one. Iâ€™m just so very tired.

Iâ€™ve considered telling my family about my anorexia, but I donâ€™t think itâ€™d go very well. They wouldnâ€™t understand and would probably just force me to eat without trying to understand why itâ€™s so hard for me in the first place. I think itâ€™d make things worse. I just donâ€™t think Iâ€™m getting better, though. Iâ€™m getting better with my self harm, Iâ€™ve been sober for a little over two months, but I canâ€™t seem to get a grip on my eating disorder..

"Iâ€™m 22 and I recently got a new â€œjobâ€ placement as part of a government scheme and I couldnâ€™t be more unmotivated, afraid and anxious at the idea. 

I used to be a positive and kind, relatively outgoing kid, my life had wonder and felt exiting and pleasant. But Iâ€™ve had noticeable and debilitating  depression for around 6 years, to the point recently of complete existential crisis and full mental breakdown. But either way it has always affected my ability to function normality, (keep up basic hygiene, be social, engage in any hobbies, have any motivation, apply and go for job interviews, let alone hold jobs) or sometimes even have the motivation to do basic things like watch YouTube videos or go for a walk.) 

For the past 3 or so years Iâ€™ve been working so hard to try and change and especially to get myself in the workplace. Iâ€™ve had a few temporary jobs but nothing permanent. Iâ€™ve tried to overcome my own limitations and fears, and to lessen the worry of my close family, as they care deeply about my well-being and truly do love me, as I deeply love them, and I canâ€™t stand to see them suffer or worry about me. 

Iâ€™ve gotten on antidepressants recently which has mostly stopped and numbed the terror and existential crisis, but hasnâ€™t really numbed the underlying depression. And the crippling social anxiety still eats away as strong as ever. Even through I thought I had overcome it.

I feel like I donâ€™t belong here, in this life. I canâ€™t function properly and the amount things I have to overcome (if they are even possible to overcome) feels impossible. 

Iâ€™ve always been in and out of temporary contract jobs, or tried jobs where I havenâ€™t been able to cut it mentally. Iâ€™ve suffered from horrible social anxiety and crippling shyness most of my life, which seems to have barley gotten better, even through steady effort. 

People seem able to push on and set themselves to a goal or career path. They drive, go out, socialise, are in relationships etc. But all that seems a universe away from me, because for me just being alive feels like Iâ€™m constantly running a marathon or drowning helpless in the ocean. 

I had an interview today after sitting at home and not hearing back from job applications for 3 months. And almost immediately I just got sick at the fakeness and stupid professional farce that the interviewer and other people put on. I cant do it, Iâ€™ve been through so much self torture, depression, terror, self hatred and existential crisis that I canâ€™t physically bring myself to put on this fake â€œfaceâ€ for people. It just all seems so fucked to me. I tried my best to kind and respectful, but probably came across like a fucking, quiet, bumbling uninterested idiot. 

And Iâ€™m struggling deeply with the idea that Iâ€™ll most likely be scrambling for and working these types of jobs for the rest of my life, because I have no real skills or passions that transfer well into jobs. And definitely no desire to scale these lower end jobs (retail, catering, office, warehouse work).

I was tortured too much by my own issues and mentality and self image to focus on things like aspirations or career paths early on in school and college. Now I feel like Iâ€™m just forced by society to work and grind, when Iâ€™m still hurting. 

If I could put my deepest emotions in the simplest terms. Iâ€™m just overwhelmingly terrified, overwhelmed, angry and tired, and Iâ€™m sure my family cant keep looking after me for much longer. 

I have this opportunity that I know my family want me to take, Iâ€™ve actually been offered the role somehow, probably cause its low pay and temporary. and I know realistically, I should take for my long term mental and financial benefit. And the mental benefit of my family. But I just donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m that person.

I see people getting up and going to work, talking and interacting without hardship or pushback or awkwardness, while I look down and shake during a simple conversation while pretending to act tough. I see People sticking it out for weeks and months and years like its so easy and natural. But it takes everything I have day by day, everything I have just to â€œattemptâ€ to have a normal conversation. Let alone push myself through a work week. The expectation to â€œwork hardâ€, â€œdonâ€™t slackâ€, â€œuphold excellenceâ€, â€œpull your weightâ€, be confidentâ€, â€œbe extrovertedâ€, be a people personâ€. I just want to tell everyone to fuck off, fucking think they know shit or can tell me shit. Fucking judge me and try to belittle me all the fucking time. I Fucking want punch out the next mf who says shit to me and expects shit out of me like its a fucking given, even though they havenâ€™t shown any respect or care or kindness towards me. And more than that I want to end myself because Iâ€™m fucking useless at everything and always have been.  

I know it would absolutely kill my mother and brother to see me fall back and retreat into weakness and isolation for the hundredth time, or even worse to hurt myself, as I know more than anything they want to see me succeed. But it all hurts so much. Itâ€™s unbearable and I just want to be away from everyone and everything. 

If they werenâ€™t around, and our love wasnâ€™t so strong, I most likely wouldnâ€™t be here. I probably would have ended it years ago. Because I donâ€™t fucking care about anything else on this earth, and nothing else on this earth cares about me.",depression_disorder
"Often I find it difficult to get out of bed in the morning, or to get work done. Sometimes I suffer from brain fog, or heavy periods of emotional pain usually triggered by something. I have persistent  suicidal thoughts everyday, and have developed nihilist ideas and philosophies towards life. But the worst of all of these things, is the anhedonia man.

I cannot experience joy in my life, I cannot look forward to anything, I cannot become excited for an event, or for something in the moment, I do not have a desire for anything. Everything I try to do is joyless, boring, unstimulating, and as a result I feel empty and am left with my thoughts, questioning the situation and everything as a whole. And if something does stimulate some sense of joy, all I can think to myself is ""Is this it? Is this really what gets people going through life?"", and that makes me sad.

It's not just activities but also sensations. Food isn't enjoyable, its all mostly bland, eating is a chore, its gotten so bad that I no longer have a hunger drive. Music isn't stimulating anymore, I feel like ive listened to everything worthy of being listened to, and now that I have exhausted all these songs, nothing will ever be enjoyable again. I have spent more time thinking about playing video games I want to play, and staring at my desktop, then I have actually playing them. Ive forced myself to read 7 novels to see if I can enjoy them. Worst of all is anything related to sex. God I have so much emotional distress related to this topic. It causes me so much pain knowing that I cannot, and probably won't ever be able to experience what it is others apparently feel.

I could keep going, but the thing is, my anhedonia isn't because of my ideas, my suicidal thoughts, my negative emotions, or the lack of energy or anything else. No, all of these things are instead manifestations that resulted over time from this empty, joyless. Of course, now that it has resulted in these things, it has made the problem even worse. Yet ironically, this suffering has become so comfortable, that I don't want to change it as I don't know who I am without it.",depression_disorder

"My life is honestly a joke

Letâ€™s begin the story of the times when I genuinely started feeling very unhappy, which I would say was about a year ago. March 2021-July 2021, I was severely depressed. I despised how I looked like. Super skinny kid, looked weak af. Anyways, everyday was the same and every night I would go to bed crying about something in my life. Quarantine really made me depressed, especially after 1 year of not seeing any of my friends, and how everyday felt the same. Also back in May 2021, I had to do an important Kidney surgery, so at that time, I had to stop playing sports and couldnâ€™t lift. I started lifting December 2020 btw, and saw massive progress, and I had to stop around Mid April. Anyways after being depressed because of kidney surgery which lasted months, I finally started going to the gym again after a few months; beginning of the school year. This time I started lifting again to better myself, and to try to get a girlfriend, Aug 2021. As ironic as it may sound, during the beginning of the school year, I was getting a lot of attention from women. I had grown taller, my physical shape looked x10 better than how it was. But little did I know that the same horror would come back. Firstly, Iâ€™d like to say that the worst mistake of my life was choosing woodshop as a class. Iâ€™d say every since Oct 2021, these 2 seniors would non-stop harass me in my woodshop class. Like it would be petty stuff, like messing with me, then it went to getting my stuff stolen. Also, I tried switching out of my woodshop class twice before, and I told my consular that I didnâ€™t want to take this class, I told her that I dont think this is a class for me. For the harassment part, I told my woodshop teacher that my stuff kept getting stolen, and I was nonstop gettting harassed by these 2. The school basically gave him a slap on the wrist and told him donâ€™t talk/harass me ever again. Sadly, the story gets even worse. On Dec 9th, at 12:15 my life was going to change. Somebody in my woodshop class shoved me into a band saw machine, causing my finger to get sliced off. I hit my head so hard on the machine that I fell back, and the entire machine tilted over, almost crushing me to death, while still on. So I couldnâ€™t see who pushed me or anything. Surprisingly, there were no witnesses either. I had to do finger reattachment surgery, to hopefully bring back my finger. I missed 1 month of school too, because I had to do something called hyperbaric treatment, to save my finger. so when I returned back I had to make up several assignments, multiple tests, and I had to do finals, all in 2 weeks. It has been almost 2 months since the incident, and the same senior kid keeps harassing me, even though I have never spoken a word to him in my life. This time I have reported it to the school, and I will have a meeting with him and the vp. Honestly I am so sick of this, sometimes I lose hope and really have thoughts of killing myself. I stopped getting attention from women, I lost all my gains, and Iâ€™m no longer a straight A student. The surgeon even said itâ€™ll take 1 year for my finger to fully heal, which means no sports or lifting. All the girls that I was previously talking to flat out ignore me. I find it crazy how someone can lose everything they worked hard for in 1 day.",depression_disorder
"Everything I do is a drag, I don't have much ambition or enjoyment in life and everything I do, having no friends or a relationship just hurts, feels like I have no reason to continue apart from doing things I'm already bored with and just living for the sake of it, I don't have much to keep me going, apart from false hopes and fantasies of my life getting better, my life just feels like a long process I can't wait to get out of, because I honestly believe that death is a better state than living as myself, I can't stand living with myself and how worthless I am, it appears that suicide isn't a frightening thought for me, but living a life I can't stand is.",depression_disorder

"I feel so lost. Nothing I try ends up working out. Iâ€™m the oldest child (28) in my family, and Iâ€™m easily my parentsâ€™ secret shame. I have a brother who works with the FBI, and a sister who works with Google. Me? I machinegunned out over 100 job applications, and the only ones responding at all are multi-level marketing/pyramid schemes. 

Iâ€™m still stuck living with my parents, being the family embarrassment. Theyâ€™d never admit it to me, but I know they look and think of me with infinite regret. â€œWhere did we go wrong?â€ Hell if I know, but hey, two hugely successful children and a loser son isnâ€™t a bad track record - thatâ€™s 2/3. 

Of course, the expectation is that I keep going. Keep applying to jobs, keep trying to find new avenues of employment, keep getting up in the morning. Why? Nobody gains anything from me being here. Not my friends, not my family. And yet here I am, at their insistence, even though the dreams I had (writing for a TV show) are so wildly out of reach itâ€™s almost comical. Even the little goals (full-time employment doing anything at all) are just about impossible, and even if somehow, by the grace of God, the recruiter went with their fourth-place choice (me), itâ€™d be only a matter of time before I screwed up everything again and wound up all the way back where I am now.

At this point, thereâ€™s no hope. Thereâ€™s nothing left. I wish I was never born, but I was, and I wish I could just sleep for a century, but I canâ€™t. All I can do is keep living out this miserable, loser life and hope that a truck runs me over or something, because thatâ€™s the only option I have left. No job will want me, nobody in their right mind would ever think about dating me, all I can do is justâ€¦ wait for the end.",depression_disorder

"Hey depression friends! I've hit another one of those periods where all I do, quite literally, is:

wake up 30 minutes before work, 
take meds
feed animals
get minimum clothing and hygiene wrangled, 
go to work,
scrounge the min snacks needed to not die, 
get off work and go straight to bed at 9:30 pm
wake up at 11:30 am and go back to work

I don't hate my job, I'm not unhappy, I don't feel sad, I'm just vaguely tired and don't feel any motivation or interest to do anything.

I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Autism, and depression. I'm sure that executive dysfunction is a decent size part of this problem.

"All my life I was never supported by my parents. When I proudly showed them something, they hardly praised me, but always criticized me. They have never taken my hobbies and such seriously and labeled them as ""unnecessary"" or ""bullshit"". To this day (I'm an adult), I'm criticized and put down by my mother for every little thing and often compared to other people who are ""so much better"" than me.

When someone supports me in something (like getting good grades) I immediately get emotional because I don't know that feeling. Today I was telling a good friend of mine about my report card grade. He said I was great and that I shouldn't worry about my parents. Not a second later I was crying. Meanwhile, my parents were scolding me that my report card grades were bad because I sucked at maths and they both know very well that I've been bad in maths since childhood. Then my dad threatened me and said that it provoked him when I cried and said that if I didn't stop crying he would gouge my eyes out. Yes, *one* of the bad things he said to me.

Now, does that count as (emotional) trauma if I cry when I get support because I don't know or hardly feel such thing?

"All I do is take care of others. I have developed no life of my own. I will continue taking care of others because it's what is expected, and because since that's all I've done I've never gotten an education or had a career. If everyone who demands of me daily disappeared I wouldn't even know what to do or where to go. I have no extended family. I don't belong to any churches or groups or organizations. I have no friends.

As shallow as it sounds to hear I have always had somewhat decent good looks, and knowing I could attract attention from someone always kind of helped me through this miserable life. I got a thrill going to the grocery store or to a doctor's office knowing I could low key flirt with someone, but now I'm too old. No one looks at women my age. Men in their 50s look at 30 year olds, if not younger. Sometimes I get looks from 80 year olds. Yay. So yeah, shallow as fuck but literally that is all I had, just that thrill. It never went anywhere. I'm married to someone who has always ignored me and in addition, I don't even have time to dedicate to myself, let alone to yet another person.

I've done loads of therapy. I've been on the psych med trail numerous times to help me with situational depression, to no avail. If my situation remains shitty, not much meds can do. Docs say ""change your life"". Yeah, ok, Dr Dildo, so easy.

I feel like it's all over. I don't see how it could get better. I can't get a divorce because I have no way to support myself, and no safety net. I can't abandon my kids, even if they should be out on their own. Plus I love them, and even if my husband takes me for granted I love him, too. I just don't like him much. 

How do I find some gdam meaning in life? I'd never do anything drastic and fuck up my kids. They're already fucked up enough. I put on the stupid happy face for everyone, try to exude positivity, while all the while wanting to run away screaming, thinking about having to do this for even another year. I thought by now the kids would be on their own and I'd have friends, maybe a job or at least free time to do what I want, instead of being at the beck and call of someone due to whatever disaster dujour is happening, whatever new drama, whatever health issue.

"When I was younger I was an athlete, good with girls, popular, etc. I was living life at exactly the same pace as my peers and I was doing it well. My first semester of college, I crashed and burned hard. I didn't make a single friend and attempted suicide midway through the semester. My parents pulled me out of school after that. I had just turned eighteen.

All of my friends had gone to a different school than I, including my best friend Bailey, whom I had fallen in love with. After nearly a year of waiting tables, living with mom and dad and having no friends or romantic options, I returned to school having followed Bailey to her school. I confessed my feelings for her and she turned me down. The friendship never recovered from that awkwardness. She told me I was like a brother to her. I was too ashamed to face her and we quickly lost contact.

I've always had esteem issues. Nobody has ever told me that I'm ugly, but the way my face looks has been a source of self hatred for me for my entire life. Thinking I'm ugly led to thinking I'm unlovable, which led to thinking I'm worthless. Bailey was the only person I could really feel comfortable unabashedly being myself around. When who I was wasn't good enough for her, I decided I must not be good enough for anyone. I became a recluse with a crippling pornography addiction. I became an incel. I frequented those online spaces, fueling my self loathing and sparking a deep loathing for other people. I've been ashamed of myself my whole life. The feedback loop of feeling anxiety and seeking out content to validate that anxiety, which also fed the anxiety, crippled me socially. It began with hating women for caring about looks, then hating men for looking good, then hating everyone for having what I couldn't. I'll touch more on this later.

Something changed when I was twenty. I was still in school and had finally, thanks to one of my few friends having forced me into it, joined a student organization. Briefly, I was living a normal life again. I made friends, had a girlfriend, established myself socially again, and was finally happy. I was able to escape the self-destructive and hateful mindsets I'd fallen into. Craving social validation turned me into a social butterfly which turned me into a party animal. Being a party animal ruined me academically. I dropped out of college a second time. Then my girlfriend graduated and moved away, COVID struck, and I lost contact with all of my friends. Having associated the feeling of social acceptance with intoxication, I began drinking heavily.

Because it worked well for me before, I got a job that would force me to get social interaction. Previously, I'd only really socialized with the ""gifted""-type people I grew up taking classes with (my school district growing up offered separate coursework for high level students). At this job, I was finally meeting regular people. At this point, my sexual history included two women. My self-loathing had prohibited me from feeling confidant enough to even try with women from the ages of 18-22. The people at my job seemed to have at least ten previous partners on average and were on average two years younger than me. For people younger than me to have accomplished so much more in less time was humiliating. My whole life, I've been ashamed of myself, and now, having had the courage to re-enter society, it is being thrown in my face how little I've managed to do in my life.

It seems so easy for other people. It always has. People have always told me that I'm an interesting and unique person, but I have never felt unique. I have only ever felt different. Different is the most awful feeling in the world. I have always been looked at as inferior. For as long as I can remember, everybody has treated me like I am different. To feign normalcy, I began lying. I lied about my sexual history, I lied about the circumstances of my youth, etc. I lied about everything and established a false persona as a lady-killing smooth talker. Eventually, I made friends at my new job. I came to be well-liked. I felt like I was finally socially succeeding again. I grew to be popular with the girls at my job and was steadily flirting with many of them, with things occasionally going a bit further here and there but nothing serious. Then, I got involved in an informal relationship with a woman from my work. I would eventually come to recognize this relationship to be very toxic. She frequently boasted about her sexual prowess and extensive sexual history. This was a great source of anxiety for me. I might as well have been a virgin. Having sex with her for the first time was the first time I had had sex since high school. I was 22. The sex was terrible in every regard and the relationship ended immediately.

While I had been involved with that woman, I was involved with another woman. My involvement with this second woman, Cheryl, was different. The courtship moved slowly and was romantic and respectful. When I made my move and asked her out on a date, Cheryl was very enthusiastic. It was a Friday night. The date was scheduled for Sunday night. Come Sunday evening, she cancelled on me. Every woman I have tried to be with since Bailey, including Bailey, have all told me the same thing, ""you're like a brother to me,"" as if I don't know that means ""you're ugly."" I don't hold it against them. I can't blame anyone for caring about looks. I care too.

I quit my job. I thought the friendships I made at work would last. At first, they did. But the culture of a social group is constantly developing, and without being present every day, I quickly came to feel left behind. ""Left behind,"" I suppose, is how I've always felt.

I stopped talking to everyone I know. My lease is up this summer and I have no idea what comes next.

I feel like every waking moment of my life is nothing but humiliation. I'm a failure and a burnout. I want to kill myself. The way my failed attempt hangs over my family haunts me. I never got to feel happy when I was young and I never wanted to grow old. What else am I to do? I've lost too much time now. I can never go back and do things right.

It's funny how, just when I thought I was starting to heal, life came along and told me I'd been right about myself the whole time.",depression_disorder

"So like most people I would assume, My parents are old Gen, Growing up in the 70s. My mom and dad both had alcoholic fathers that abused their family and tormented them when drunk. They grew up differently and I understand werenâ€™t shown the Love they deserved, they had to move forward regardless. 

Now the thing is, my parents failed to end the cycle and ended up with 3 kids, me being the middle child. Since my earliest memories I remember watching them fight very violently and several instances where I had to spend the night somewhere else. Now it wasnâ€™t All bad all my life, My dad worked very hard as he was conditioned to and seemed to buy us things every now and then, even a few vacation trips. But that was the latter.

Growing up my parents never seemed proud of me for anything, other than a â€œoh ok good jobâ€ very monotone if it occurred. I was never taught how to be independent, my dad never played me with me as a kid, never taught me how to fight, how to treat women or my first gf, he never cared to set up any foundation for me, he spent most his time working and drinking when he was home, my Mom spent the whole time victimizing herself instead of asking how we were doing. I remember skipping school bc my mom wanted me to be home so sheâ€™d be safe. Now my parents have tried to mend their relationship over the years but I feel whatâ€™s the point of living. My parents only care Slightly about my achievements, I will never get the love I wanted as a kid, the security I needed to be a kid in my home. Now this isnâ€™t a sob story but just putting the pieces together I donâ€™t see why I should break the cycle for me only. I rather not be here knowing I was a careless accident. And I spent a lot of my time growing up reflecting rather than moving on that I feel stuck. I wasted many years of my development trying to fix my parents and always trying to be a good person towards them until I realized they were POS. 

At the core Iâ€™m most angry at the fact I was so young, and they would shout and break things never trying to calm down but rather who can out do each other, they never talked to me afterwards and just left things as is. Now with my youngest brother here, the moment i even raise my voice â€œIâ€™m the bad guy â€œ they seem to forget everything they put us through and think itâ€™s nothing bc they went through harder things and they turned out â€œfineâ€. Yet they are narcissists with no friends, hobbies, quirks, just lonely people. I donâ€™t want to end up like them, anyone going through something similar ?",depression_disorder
"I'm M/17 and I started college last September. 
I've got my interim report and it isn't really good. There are 13 subjects. Only in 4 subs I had good marks (A- to B-). All the others go from C to D-

An important subject called IT is involved in this mess too. I've got a D- there. My parents have seen this all. They are worried and desperated. I don't want them to be desperated or worried. I feel guilt. I've put so much effort in this semester and it went quite down nevertheless. The stress and all keeps pulling me down. Everytime when I have stress, my nose starts to bleed. I'm afraid this is a symptom of a serious disease. I'm afraid to see a doctor, because I'm always scared of doctor visits. Mostly because of my phobia, the fear of needles. I'm afraid to get my blood drawn or to get a vaccination. ( I got my first covid vaccine, but I had to overcome my fear which gave me a lot of anxiety and panic.) 

Back to school stuff:

I get always excluded from class. Nobody wants to talk to me, show appreciation when I help, even when I have to do my stuff. They make fun of me in group chats and Co way more often. 
I'm always the last choice when they are selecting teams.
I'm afraid to have a meal in front of my class mates, so I search a corner to relax and eat, because they made fun of the food I eat months ago (in College) (Random sandwiches, if somebody wants to know). 

The next things which keep me questioning for my existence are phobias. 

I have got the...

Fear of dogs (There were times were I nearly got bitten by pitbulls)
Fear of needles (childhood trauma)
Fear of getting ridiculed
Fear of doctor visits (Fear of needles: 'Blood drawals or vaccinations') -&gt; Trypanophobia

Fear of Spiders (insects generally)

Fear of illness
Fear of accidents
Fear of mistakes
Fear of planes (flights)
Fear of being stared at
Fear of sleep (Because of sleep paralysis and shocking paranormal nightmares)
Sedatephobia
Phonophobia


I'm not diagnosed with depression, because I'm afraid to talk with a doctor about this all. I don't want my nose bleeding there. They will do test my blood pressure and get a blood drawals, where I could fall in panic.

I am afraid to talk with a family member about this, because they would be worried about me and I would feel a high degree of guilt, what I don't want, so I shared more information about me than my parents know, because I think here on this sub, there are people who are going through tough times too and could build a connection with me. 

I would never wish somebody else a life like mine. If you want to know how it feels: It hurts to be alive, it hurts to keep fighting, it hurts to keep facing new problems, it really hurts to meet new fates.

I'd appreciate your help. Thanks.

I don't think I can ever get a girlfriend because of how small I am. The only good thing about me is that I am sort of attractive but my size and weight puts people off. Nobody takes me seriously cause how short and skinny I am. Other 17 year olds treat me like a baby and shit. I've never had a car or a job. Since I dropped out I can only work at shitty places you know. I can work for a GED which I'm thinking of doing, but I don't even know what's the point to continuing life. I've thought about suicide but I didn't think I could have the balls to do that. I don't know where my life is going and I can't see myself doing too well as an adult. I hope I can be happy and successful but I just don't see that coming.",depression_disorder

"I've been super depressed recently and it feels like it would just be better if I end it all. I break down crying more than a few times a day, and my family could care less about me. I tried roleplaying and fantasizing to pass the time but it's not working anymore. I might not ever feel real happiness again. And that single thought is like the final nail in my coffin.

Some days I donâ€™t even see anyone I can just say a quick â€˜hiâ€™ to. 

Iâ€™m always comparing myself with other people and I feel completely worthless about myself. Iâ€™m not as pretty as others, I havenâ€™t achieved as much as them, I donâ€™t have friends/ relationships with people, like others do. I feel like Iâ€™m nothing. Idk how to be good enough. 

I donâ€™t think there is such thing as happiness for me. I feel like Iâ€™m destined to be sad forever, and continue to dislike myself. Others will always be better than me. Iâ€™ll never be perfect, or good enough. Iâ€™ll never achieve my dreams in life.

"For years now I have felt this darkness looming over me and a demon pulling me down into a deep and dark abyss, and in this abyss is where I met depression, which latched onto me and will probably never truly let go.

I feel like a ghost most of the time, watching the world pass me by as if Iâ€™m not part of it, I can look in and see, but I cannot reach anything or anyone and nobody can see me or hear me cryingâ€¦

I feel lost in life, Iâ€™ve felt lost for so long now and I have no idea where I am going in this life, and when you donâ€™t know the answer to that question, life can seem very dull indeed, which can then make you question the point in stayingâ€¦ Iâ€™m still here though, I am not sure how or why, but I am.

Sometimes I just want to scream, scream as loud as I possibly can, but I donâ€™t. And even if I did, I know it would solve anything. Sometimes it is easier to hide how we truly feel, isnâ€™t it?

I feel like I fuck up every opportunity in life and that there's something so defective about me that I'll just spend the next few decades of my sorry life seeing myself ruin every good thing after another.

"Looking back, I feel like Iâ€™ve been depressed since 2nd grade. Itâ€™s always been the same thing, I canâ€™t make friends, or I didnâ€™t fit in. Recently itâ€™s gotten worse, I fear the future and I dread living in the present, I look at my past and I feel pained by every missed opportunity, every moment I spent depressed that shouldâ€™ve been happy. It gets in the way of relationships, work, hobbies, I just canâ€™t escape it. 

I donâ€™t want to have people close to me, I always end up thinking that Iâ€™d hurt them. I randomly push people away, ignore text, or I donâ€™t socialize at all. But I want to talk to others, I want friends, I want a girlfriend, I want someone in my life I can cherish but Iâ€™m afraid of myself. So I just give up on it entirely. 

What right do I have to complain about though? I have a good family, a good living situation, Iâ€™ve been successful at work and in school, so why canâ€™t I be happy? Why canâ€™t I appreciate what I have? Sometimes I wish I could give my life to someone who would appreciate it, someone who sees the value in life and wouldnâ€™t throw it away because they feel sad. 

I just want to live and not simply exist. I donâ€™t want give up on life but itâ€™s so hard sometimes. Iâ€™ve coped with this for so long that I donâ€™t know if it will ever go away. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll every be happy. So whatâ€™s the point? Why should continue if it brings me so much pain.

I doubt Iâ€™ll ever take my own life, maybe this will someday end and itâ€™ll be just another part of my life. But right now, I donâ€™t see the light at the end of the tunnel.",depression_disorder

"I've been sad for a very long time, ever since I was about 10. It used to be content. Then it became boredom. And then it was longing. And then just sadness. And then loneliness, and now right alongside that, depression. Sometimes now, it even feels like mania. That's all it's ever been really. 

I was bullied when I was a kid sure. But my childhood wasn't traumatic. It wasn't terrifying, it wasn't something where I suffered any economical hardships or what have you. It was just lonely. It was nothing. And it still feels like that. I've tried so much to be a part of things, and to be someone likable that I also like being. But for over half my life, it's only ever felt like I've watched every other person around me go and experience the things that I've wanted to experience. Everyone else has the opportunities, the character, or the people. It feels like every time I make things better for myself, I take them away in moments, without ever meaning too.

But I also feel like my life is nothing to feel shitty over. I feel like there's a lot that I've been able to take for granted or have avoided because of my circumstances. And while yes, people have definitely definitely had it worse for me, I just wish someone in my life could tell me that everything is going to be okay. That I've not ruined things again. I want someone to notice how terrible I feel and just ask me if I'm alright. No one ever really does that. I just wish someone cared.",depression_disorder

Last night I tried to go to bed early and had a PTSD flashback and felt sick to my stomach. What if I see my rapist this weekend when I'm back home? Today I've done nothing working from home. My sister called and cried on the phone. Her medical school classmate committed suicide last night. I thought about killing myself or self harming last weekend for the first time in years. My empathy and mental health intertwined, which emotions are mine? I'm supposed to be smart, accomplished, kind, and funny. Lately I feel like a dumby.

She isnâ€™t financially independent and has nothing to spend on herself. My father belittles her and fights whenever she buys a dress or goes shopping. Which is not fair because we are medium rich and can afford shopping once in a while.

I have played the game in its entirety, and though I have never struggled with any type of severe mental illness, I still fear for how this game could affect her mentally, because of how similar her situation is to the struggles that Sayori goes through.

Itâ€™s not like you can tell your few  friends or family that you feel like a dull soggy piece of bread most of the time and that sometimes when you cry itâ€™s so agonising that you donâ€™t want to exist, they wouldnâ€™t understand and the conversation would be uncomfortable. All this shit about having people that notice youâ€™re not okay and that acknowledge it just seems like total bullshit. I canâ€™t even get a therapist to vent to, itâ€™s been over a year since my last one left and Iâ€™ve been in the waiting list ever since.  I feel so unwanted, I have little scenes in my head of me hugging and comforting myself and I know no one else will give that to me anytime soon.",depression_disorder
"I'm tired. Tired of being alone. Tired of being depressed. Tired of not getting a good nights sleep for months at a time. Everyday I look in the mirror see the bags under my eyes getting darker and my hair getting grayer. I just want someone to hold me and tell me they love me. I've had dreams that I was in love back when I used to dream. It was the best thing I've ever felt and I've craved it ever since. I have seen friends fall in love, watched their relationships blossom into marriage. Hell, one of my friends made me tbe best man at his wedding since I'd been rooming with him when he met his fiance and saw their relationship flourish. Sorry I'm rambling but somethings need to be said. I guess I really want to know, should I even try to get back into dating? Im a fucking loser. I enjoy video games and comic books, useless movie trivia and history. I work a simple 9-5. Boring and nerdy, a fantastic combination. I used to draw, but that was before my mental breakdown 10 years ago, and that guy died that day. I used to be on 5 different dating apps, never got a response aside from obvious scams and 2 sentances of bland uninterest in me. My irl dating went even worse. Only ever ghosted and told ""oh your a nice guy you'll make a girl very happy someday."" yeah, right. My friends tell me the same thing, but my self doubts and self hatred twist my mind. ""they're lying. you'll die alone."". I dont like it there, in my head i mean. I guess thats another reason 'd like a relationship, someone to get me out of there, tell me i am a good person. maybe it'd feel more genuine. let me break down my mind and rebuild it right this time.

When I'm alone, I am plagued with intrusive thoughts and depressive demons, but as soon as I'm around anyone else that changes. It doesn't matter who it is either. It's like I have developed the subconscious ability to automatically put on a mask that smiles and laughs and cracks jokes. But it's not me. At least, it doesn't feel like it is. It feels fake, but there's no way to stop it without people asking questions like, ""What's wrong?"", or  ""Are you ok?"". I guess I could just answer with ""I'm just not faking anymore."" but that will only cause people to be concerned and I just don't want to deal with that.

My first year of uni was very difficult as I was very depressed everyday but still managed to do well. School was a distraction for me, and now Iâ€™m on summer break and have no clue what to do. I was always an introvert so being alone wasnâ€™t really an issue for me until now. Itâ€™s starting to affect me everyday. Since I turned 19 I realized how much I missed out on in terms of having fun. I have no friends. Iâ€™ve struggled to make friends my whole life. I have a fear that Iâ€™ll be judged by others. Being at home makes it worse. My family is not very understanding and they can be very rude and say things you shouldnâ€™t say to someone.

If I donâ€™t kiss the ass of other residents, I will be berated for not having the almighty job which is the only way Iâ€™m going to be seen as a normal person. 

Really? How can I work when I can barely get myself to shower once or twice a week? Or feed myself? Itâ€™s all a chore. My exhaustion from depression and stress makes everything a chore. I canâ€™t even get myself to play a video game. All I crave and can do is sleep and take pills. I canâ€™t even drive because of trauma and anxiety, with no one to help me with it. I attempted to look for an online job, and I felt a sense of dread when I did so. I donâ€™t want it to be like this; Iâ€™d love to have the push that everyone else has to work or want a career. Iâ€™d love to have the mentality of â€œget over itâ€ and â€œthatâ€™s lifeâ€ like so many people fucking love to tell me but I donâ€™t. Not one person IRL is able to tell me anything but to suck it up, get over it, everyone has to do this or that. Fuck you. I didnâ€™t want to be brought into this shit world. Fuck you for doing it when there was no stable residence to raise me in, nothing but poverty and a dysfunctional physical and mental abusive â€œfamilyâ€. None of this is my fault. People shouldnâ€™t havenâ€™t children unless you know you can take care of them, you know youâ€™ll have money, you know youâ€™ll have a place to live, you know theyâ€™ll be safe, you know they wonâ€™t be abandoned at birth by the other party. Instead you took a chance, rolled the dice, and Iâ€™m the one suffering. But itâ€™s all up to me now, Iâ€™m supposed to just deal with it, Iâ€™m supposed to just make my own way and build myself up from the bottom like some shitty emotional drama.

Thatâ€™s not how it works. Iâ€™m not right in the head. I need help and guidance and Iâ€™ve never had it. Fuck everyone thatâ€™s made me feel like shit and guilty for not being able to be another cog in society. I didnâ€™t ask for any of this. You think I donâ€™t hate myself enough? You think I donâ€™t know you all view me as a disappointment? Iâ€™m tired. Sleep is the only way Iâ€™m not aware of my existence or surrounding.

"I think I may have depression, ADHD, and bipolar disorder. Of course, I'm not officially diagnosed but the symptoms are pretty obvious. I'm sure something is wrong with me, depression is obvious, and the rest is something I suspect. Anyway, my question is related to my strange feeling of rage, anger, and frustration at random strangers but not only. 

For example, yesterday I was on a bus on my way to the cinema and the bus was late. In addition to that, there was heavy traffic and I was stressed I'm gonna be late for the movie. In a situation like this, I'm getting extremely frustrated and wanna scream. I insult people in my head, every single person that passes me by or is near me. I even have thoughts of getting violent with strangers like beating them so they would shut the fuck up. Sometimes I'm afraid I'm gonna act on my feeling. I just hate people so much. In periods of heavy depression, I often go outside and scream in my head "" don't look at me, don't look at me"" maniacally. I think I change being stressed to being angry. I also insult people a lot in my head. I'm thinking terrible things. I even despise my flatmates. They are a couple and I can't stand them anymore. I don't envy their relationship hell no. It's just that they irritate me so much I often have the urge to scream because I'm so angry and frustrated. Everything they do pisses me off. I'm now 21 but as far as I remember it was always like this. In middle school I had friends but I was pretty straightforward when someone talked behind my back. When I was like 8-10 I often got into fights with the boys. In high school, I despised every single one of my classmates and couldn't make friends because we didn't get along. Now I'm at uni and it's the same. Mainly because we are so different and I hate these types of people. I also noticed that the more stressed I am the more aggressive I become. It's also worth mentioning that when I was like 7-8? maybe even younger I took a kitchen knife and threatened my mother I'm gonna kill her. Of course, I quickly realized what I was doing, cried, and begged my mother for forgiveness. I sometimes just blow up, like I can't emotionally deal with a situation at home and scream terrible things at one of my family members. Then I'm forced to apologize even If I'm the one being abused for years. Nowadays I just hate people in general, don't wanna have friends, and can't communicate with people. It's worth mentioning that I was raised almost in isolation (apart from going to school) till the age of 19. Should I be worried? What may it indicate? Does anyone have similar issues?",depression_disorder

I don't go outside my home, which is sad because I'm 19 years old. Only time I go is to go to pharmacy for antidepressants. I don't want to share this energy, I just wish I could observe this world not live in it, because I'm so problematic.",depression_disorder
"I've read so many articles, watched so many videos on psychology, and maybe I'm just overthinking it now. Maybe it's not depression and I'm like subconsciously trying to find an excuse to be lazy, to explain mood swings and stuff? Sometimes I feel like I'm faking it. 

Or maybe I really need help, I don't think my parents need to know though. So far, everytime my mom hears about someone committing suicide she just goes ""Yeah they deserve it"" or ""This world is better without those psychos"" or ""Why do they think someone care about them dying?"", everytime someone mentions depression she says ""Dont ever talk about that sh-t again"", and my dad thinks the same, they think it's all made up by someone for something. My dad thinks that "" they're all just snowflakes"". 

It makes me doubt my own feelings. I don't understand what's going on around me and inside my head. My mood swings sometimes, I feel a bit happier every now and then, and then angry, hopeless (my brain goes parkour on that lol). My sleeping schedule doesn't exist, I either sleep for 3 hours, or 12 hours. I eat too much and then don't eat at all. I have barely done any homework this year and am 99% sure I'm gonna be expelled. I isolated from my few friends. I have no idea where my life is going.

Am I just trying to find an excuse or what? Or do I need help. Why can't my brain just tell me what's wrong?

"My name is Canon and I created an account because Iâ€™m in desperate need of support from this community. If I could only find people to relate too â€¦ Hereâ€™s my story,

Currently 25 years old and have been struggling w/ depression and generalized anxiety since I was in college about 7 years ago. Very dedicated, hard working individual who has made his way up into a great career path, making good money for my age. Despite the hard work Iâ€™ve put in and the time Iâ€™ve spent on my career, Iâ€™m in the process of reaching my end goals and am burnt out, extremely overworked, under appreciated, and saddened almost every day. Have been with my girlfriend now for almost 8 years and Iâ€™m actively fighting for my relationship. Weâ€™ve been through it all and I feel as if the downfall of our relationship is entirely my fault due to my mental instabilities / depressive state / and overall sadness that has taken over my life. All I want to do is marry this woman, and I feel as if Iâ€™m my own worst enemy â€¦ My anxieties and depression have almost ruined us dozens of times. Despite being a social guy, Iâ€™ve struggled with a social anxiety that randomly swept over me years ago, resulting in me not showing up for her when sheâ€™s needed me the most. 

When the times are really bad, I struggle with thoughts of ending my life â€¦ I struggle with the feeling of being good enough for her, and feel as if Iâ€™m burnt out with myself. Iâ€™m so consistently angry and disappointed with myself and the mental state Iâ€™m in most the time. I know my potential and what the real Canon is like when heâ€™s not facing his depression or anxieties that cripple him. If only I could fully access that version of me all the time â€¦ the confident guy who loves to be there for anybody and everybody. The guy who loves to make people laugh and show appreciation to all the people that make my life special. Unfortunately, I feel as if I can only express my true self and truly feel comfortable in my own skin on occasion, maybe once or twice a week. The rest of the time I am sad â€¦ and feeling as if Iâ€™m a complete screw up who canâ€™t do anything right, who canâ€™t please his girlfriend, who canâ€™t properly make his way through life, who struggles with continuing on living this life and finding meaning in it all â€¦

Thereâ€™s so much more to my story â€¦ If only I could find any more mid 20 year old guys who can relate with me. I would give anything to be able to find people to relate with and have support from. I feel like Iâ€™m trying to tackle everything on my own and Iâ€™m overwhelmed with everything in my life.

I can just watch shows and play video games to distract myself and not feel like shit for a bit of time, but I did that so much that I'm kind of burnt out from it. Every single outcome in life seems so miserable. I can't see myself being happy in any circumstance. The only decent one would be to inherit some millions so I can visit places and rot away in some isolated house in peace. That would be wonderful because at least I could just try to do things that I enjoy without too many responsiblities, but of course it's plainly impossible. Like, what the fuck am I supposed to do? I've been thinking about killing myself for 15 years now and I don't think that I'll ever do it, but it's so painful to live. I would really like for suicide to be normalized, so maybe I wouldn't feel guilty about it because it isn't written anywhere that everybody must feel well, than why am I forced to keep living? It doesn't make any sense. Being alive is just not worth.",depression_disorder

Our â€œyouthâ€, is like hot metal on a blacksmiths anvilâ€¦ easily changed with a few decent swings. Adaptable and moldableâ€¦ but as the hot metal coolsâ€¦ and as we grow old.. we settle in to our ways. And it becomes much harder to shape the, now cooled, metalâ€¦ it does not want to change, it would rather breakâ€¦ but.. if the right steps are taken, heating up that metal again is possible.. and changing our lives is possibleâ€¦ but if you do not know howâ€¦ you simply wonâ€™tâ€¦ it is like telling a fisherman to forge you a sword. They simply donâ€™t know how.. itâ€™s not because they are incapable of it.. they just havenâ€™t been taught. And a lot of people are like that nowadays. Theyâ€™re just fishermen trying to create swords

I was exposed to love and care beyond all conventional and traditional limitations. The kind you donâ€™t see, but always hope to.. the kind that you dream about as a teenager but feel is impossibleâ€¦ but unfortunately.. I encountered that dream. And thatâ€™s a hard dream to wake up fromâ€¦ willingly or not.. there likely wonâ€™t be another time where I get to experience that. So Ive been holding onto those memories, closely. And over time they have burned a hole in my heart. One that I fear cannot be fixed, not without the care and commitment I have already experienced and come to know so well.. and hold so dearlyâ€¦ this.. is a double-edged blade though.. if not a triple already..because now that I know it exists. And is out there somewhere in the worldâ€¦ itâ€™s become somewhat of a standard for me.. itâ€™s something I look for within people subconsciously without even realizing any of it all.. Until now at least. As I write this.. this â€œstandardâ€ hurts meâ€¦ and my chances in relationships and friends... But truthfully. After experiencing that level of care how can I be expected to forget?â€¦ I donâ€™t know..fuck, now Iâ€™m back to being sad. Catch ya later..alligator",depression_disorder

"Sup crew! So I'm gonna give a backstory and then express what I need help with.

Friday night/Saturday morning: 
food poisoning and consistent vomiting for a few hours. Putting my body through extreme stress.

Sunday: HUGE family argument (got a toxic familyðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸But I've compartmentalize this pretty well for 20+ years) putting my mental state through extreme turmoil. Dealt with some wild thoughts which made me reach out to the side of my family that's not toxic. 

Monday came and I felt nothing and was anxious. Like I was emotionally disconnected. Felt like I was asleep while awake. I made sure I ate, drank, and did a mild workout to try and feel better. 

Tuesday however, came and I knew I wasn't feeling good but I suddenly felt extremely weak in my body and lightheaded. 
Extremely hungry even after I've eaten. 
The headache would just come and go. 
I slept for over 12+ hours because I just felt so weak. Even had to leave work early due to how weak I was feeling. 

I am concerned with what's happening. I've had depressive episodes before and anxiety but never accompanied by these visceral reactions. 

I guess I'm looking to see if anyone has experienced this and what did you do to resolve it. Even if it's just confirming that it's a response to the extreme stress and stimuli Iâ€™ve put on my body recently.",depression_disorder
"   There's absolutely a comforting feeling associated with feeling depressed. I've spent most of my conscious life being depressed and not feeling like I can accomplish very much. I have supportive people, but not supportive to the extent that can help somebody as inconsolable as myself. Like my mother for instance. She is so kindhearted and caring when I may need, but she can also be very judgemental and takes things to extremes that they do not need to go, and whenever I talk to her about how I'm feeling, she cries, which only makes me feel worse.
My depression has reached a stage of ahedonia; I do not feel pleasure from the things that once brought me joy. I don't even cry anymore, unless I open up to somebody about the way I feel, which takes complete and utter defeat and hurt in my heart for me to do.
And I don't hate opening up either. I enjoy doing it. But I cannot get the words out the way I'd like to, and I end up diluting the things that are actually wrong with me, ultimately making seem like the wrong kind of attention-seeking. 

   With that being said. How do I feel comfort when I'm sad? Well, I don't always. A lot of times I do, but not always. The comfort, for myself, derives from the idea that being depressed is easier than having to rebuild past relationships, rethink everything, and restart a life that I started. Just like in the same way that ignorance is bliss. Being sad, for me, is comforting. There is something else to it too...
   The 'happiness' was due to the fact that whilst others preferred company and friends I could do without both. Survive without both.
I also felt an heightened sense of self awareness. True when u have no one around u know yourself much better. Such times gave me an opportunity to experience scenarios such as ' the world vs me '. It is a very strange feeling. But I often viewed myself as the one who viewed the crowds from a distance seeing as they were; people who were same , of the Same color ...lost in crowds, generic and common. While I was different and I understood I was different. I used to think that from their perspective they thought I was some lost idiot with no sense of direction. But within me I had understood that there is no true direction and the direction they were following seemed right because the masses were following it.

But, of course, it is when the loneliness feels like loneliness and when the gloom feels like doom. Those are the times I fucking hate myself, and want to make bad decisions so I can numb my pain, and also numb the feeling of wanting to numb my pain. The forethought of not being able to numb myself some how is like an internal feeling of watching someone you love dearly die right in front of you, completely unable to do anything about it.",depression_disorder

"I started birth control 3 months ago, first month and a half/2 with 0 side effects. I experience no physical side effects except for one: I started feeling depressed and down. When I was younger Iâ€™d get this feeling and I experienced it for so long it started feeling like home, once the feeling started fading away it felt like i lost a part of myself, since I was so used to it I was so sure that thatâ€™s how I was meant to feel. I grew out of it and now iâ€™m starting to go back to the same spot. Finding myself listening to the same music, writing the same messages to myself, thinking the same way I used to. I talked to my doctor and she suggested getting off the pill, or waiting 3 more months (your body takes 6 months to adjust to the birth control) but there is a 50/50 chance that I will stay feeling the same after these extra 3 months. I honestly do not want to get off the pill since I started it because of acne and hormonal imbalance. If i get off the pill and my acne starts going crazier (it hasnt fully gone yet) i will just feel self conscious and not want to leave the house. Although lately all i have been thinking about is suicide and when I will end it all, I donâ€™t know what to do. I need support and i dont think my boyfriend understand that im feeling/acting this way because of how i feel, when I get upset it doesnt bother him and if I explain that itâ€™s because of the birth control he will simply tell me to get off or change brands but he doesnâ€™t understand my issues with my hormonal acne.

"I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for a few years now. It has been over six months since I left my last job which was extremely stressful and had very toxic environment. I was severely burned out and it felt like I have hit rock bottom.

Things got much better after I left the job and took some time to relax and recover. I no longer feel as bad as I used to, but I am not being able to move forward with my life. I have to look for a new job, I have planned to apply for masters next year, I also have some diy projects that I had decided to complete, but I just can't get any of these things done.

I had started using a planner since the beginning of this year and now I can't even get myself to open the planner. I don't know how to drag myself out of this.

"Hey everyone, for some reason I now feel the need to connect with random people online again, oh well. Anyway, I guess this is a vent post now

How long is a depressive episode usually lasting? I've had them for the past couple years lasting around like what, a few weeks maybe, then I got out of it again and slipped back into one a few weeks or even months later. I got used to it.

Now I have been in a bad one for multiple months and I cannot even tell when it started getting like that. Every time I think it is getting better it actually becomes worse or stays the same. I try to distract myself and pursue a bunch of different hobbies but I wish I could just do nothing but sleep and not wake up for a while. I barely get any sleep but that is not my point here. I am capable of having fun occasionally but when I stop doing the thing I was onto and get home it just all starts again.

I luckily still have a will to live and I cling onto goals I set for myself that I want to achieve before I die. I guess I set the bar too high but that is somewhat of a strategy as I don't know what happens once I reach them. I'd have to make new ones I guess, so I have new things to live for.

But also if I died now I won't know that I never got there because well duh, I'd be dead. Don't worry, I don't have the intention to harm or even kill myself but the thought of it doesn't want to fully go away. It would be so nice to just... not exist. I don't hate myself, I just hate existing and everything being so fucking hard

Positive ending I guess, here is some achievements of the past week

* I finally cooked something instead of getting McDonalds every day
* have brushed my teeth at least once, sometimes twice a day since Sunday and I have showered twice this week
* I have eaten three meals a day for most days, even if it was just something small
* I made myself leave the house every weekday to go to the office and see people (I have the option to remote work but that makes it worse)
* I slept over four hours per night, working my way up to 5
* I worked out on Monday
* I sent in important paperwork, I may or may not have been procrastinating it since mid-April... yeah",depression_disorder
"I've had moments of depression for some time. The weird thing is, I can't figure out why.
My background: I'm studying in college. I have no family problems or financial problems. I try to take care of myself (exercise, diet, ...). I basically have nothing to complain about. I've never been very lucky with women. School is sometimes challenging but that can be expected. One of the things that annoys me is that I can't drive (because of fear, etc.). I like to spend time outside and I'm more of an introvert. As you can see, I have a pretty good life.

Nevertheless, sometimes I completely collapse. It's been getting worse lately. It occurs to me that I am behind in life. As if my brain was showing me all my failures (at school, with girls, and other shortcomings). Usually such a ""breakdown"" lasts one day. It happens to me on average once every 2 weeks. I used to get over it somehow. But now it's harder. It also gets into a state where I am thinking about suicide. I'm afraid of myself.

I don't know who to consult with. How to solve it. And most importantly: Why is this happening? I have a nice life, so why do I feel that way? Do you have any experience how to get out of something like this? Or advice with whom to consult and how to deal with it?

"Me (19 male) i'm suffering from depression for 3 years rn it has been a thought time to get here, when i was 8 or so my mom and my dad needed someone to take care of me when they weren't at home so my neighbors son that was 14 back on those days gently offered himself to take care of me and my little brother when they weren't at home, at first she refused but he kept on bothering her that he could do this while she searched after someone to take care of us. After some time insisting my mom let him take care of us, it was very good for us he was ouer ""friend"", for some time it was very funny but those good moments were gone as fast as they came. One day my parents and my little brother were going  to my grandmother's house and I wanted to say at my house so my mom called my neighbor's son to ask him if he could come to my house to take care of me, as soon as he accepted he was at my door step my parents left and I stayed home with him it was all going normal until he suggested that we play a new game he invented. I was a curious kid I really got exited when he suggested that then he said for this game you need to be blindfolded to play, I got a little bit confused but I accepted, than it happened he guided me through the house for a few minutes when he suddenly stopped and threw me on the floor  and raped me, while doing this he said to me that if I said what he had done to me we would kill me and my little brother, I was a little kid and didn't knew what just happened so I just followed my life just like it never happened, the time passed and he kept on doing this 2 or 3 times a week it just stopped when my mom found someone to take care of me, it happened one more time later on that year when another person a lot older did it to me again but it really hurts me and I don't want to talk about it, so now It took all my self confidence and all it hurts so badly I can't focuse in my life I can't study for college without crying for hours,  I can't eat, I feel dirty every second, I can't sleep, i can't even make friends, i'm alone studying on other state away from the only things that kept me a little happy I'm away of my parents, I'm away from my brother, i'm away from my girlfriend and I can't complete a full conversation without crying it's taking everything and everyone that I love from me i'm tired of all this it hurts so bad neither my psychologist or the drugs are helping me anymore i'm felling lost whith my thoughts.

"Hi. This is my first post on this sub so I hope Iâ€™m not breaking any guidelines.

Iâ€™m not sure if what Iâ€™m feeling is related to depression or not, so I wanted to ask for some help and advice if thatâ€™s okay.

I just finished my freshman year of college after battling depression for a bit over 8 years. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve got it completely under control, but Iâ€™ve been seeking help and making improvements where I can. I feel ready to make progress and heal. However, Iâ€™ve noticed that, despite becoming happier and more socially active again, I still have yet to regain motivation. I feel unmotivated to choose a major or do my coursework and I donâ€™t feel compelled to even get a summer job or find a way to make passive income. I still have little to no hobbies and nothing sounds interesting or really gets my attention. Iâ€™m not sure if maybe I have an attention deficit disorder or if this is a part of depression that is common to struggle with. I just feel very unmotivated to do regular adult life things other than see friends and relax/watch videos and play games. I like things like graphic design and weather but I just canâ€™t get myself motivated to go to college for any of it. I just feel so unmotivated to get a job or do something considered socially â€œproductiveâ€.

Any advice, help, or similar experiences?",depression_disorder
"Before the big 2021 lockdown we had in Australia I had just moved away from my family and ended up spending the better half of a year in my small bedroom failing uni work. It was very obvious to me after lockdown ended that I was probably exhibiting depressive symptoms during that time. But after lockdown I was pretty sure it was done and would go away. That was silly haha, though I feel alright most of the time I feel like something has like permanently changed in my brain and Iâ€™m not sure what, I have trouble focusing on lots of things and just generally doing anything for myself. The weird thing is I started dating someone in January and I love them so much, and I have no problem doing things for them, I just have trouble taking care of myself especially regarding things like eating and getting out of bed, but if theyâ€™re hungry Iâ€™ll go make food instantly, theyâ€™re aware of this and do try and help, getting me to make food for myself as well when making food and just reminding me to eat. Iâ€™ve been trying to instill in myself that I need to love myself like I love others but it just doesnâ€™t seem to happen. Iâ€™m just not sure what it is, and I just feel exhausted atm even though Iâ€™ve hardly moved today. Also to make it worse I tore my acl a few months ago taking away playing sport and walking which were two of my favourite things.

"okay so firstly this is gonna be long iâ€™m sorry i got a lot on my mind :/ itâ€™s kind of hard to put into words but iâ€™ll try. 

i (f18) firmly believe that my purpose is to be so unremarkable and disappointing that it makes those around me look better, and once iâ€™ve served my purpose, i am quickly discarded.

basically, i go through life watching everyone else live theirs without living mine bc iâ€™m too busy crafting specific personalities for specific people. i donâ€™t even know who i am. my wardrobe is just sweatshirts and leggings bc i genuinely donâ€™t know what my style is so i just wear whatâ€™s comfortable. i cant even confidently tell you my favorite color. itâ€™s like any attempt to discover or better myself is shut down in one way or other bc it doesnâ€™t benefit the â€œmain characters.â€ anytime i might step out of line is always held against me, but i forgive others for literally everything because i donâ€™t have a choice but to. beggars canâ€™t be choosers you know? 

another thing; it hurts seeing all your friends hang out and interact without you and then when you bring it up, you get told that itâ€™s all in your head, but you know that itâ€™s not. i care about others opinions of me excessively and over time iâ€™ve discovered that i donâ€™t really have a sense of individuality. i did an entire personality change freshman year because people said i was unapproachable, but now iâ€™m not interesting. itâ€™s rly exhausting.

add low self esteem, health issues, race issues (!!), and undiagnosed mental health issues on top of all of that too.

idk what the conclusion or moral of all this is and idk what to do about it or if anyone else has ever felt this way, iâ€™m just sad lmfao but i appreciate you if you actually read all of this.",depression_disorder

I'm embarrassed to tell my pals because we agreed to graduate in the same year (next year), but the subject in which I failed will undoubtedly throw the timetable off.

My friend said I was lucky, which pissed me off because a week ago I couldn't get any schoolwork done, was barely eating, and was ignoring all my friends because being around them was exhausting (not that this week is much better, and it seems like it might be a repeat). So I told her it was because my mom thought it was making my depression worse. The kid I didn't really know was like, ""wait, you have depression,"" and I said ""apparently"" because I'm stupid and couldn't just say yes. Later my friend told me again how lucky I was, and I spent the entire rest of the day angry at her (or whatever angry is when you're too emotionally drained to argue with someone or show any emotion). Maybe I didn't make it super clear that I actually have depression and my mom wasn't just being a helicopter parent, but I would think after all the school I've missed and the ghosting and jokes about suicide she would realize something's wrong. I guess that's just left to my other friends who ignore everything that's wrong for months, and then finally decide to tell someone but refuse to talk about it in front of me and keep telling me ""we're all fucked up.""",depression_disorder
"Iâ€™m a 26 year old female who is tired of living but Iâ€™m too scared to kill myself. So many things have happened in a few months and it seems like the universe is out to get me. (major life changes) I am a grad student, but thatâ€™s the only thing going for me.

Today, I realized how shit my life is.
1) I have heart damage from COVID, my heart rate has to be controlled by medication. Life long damage unless I get heart surgery. 
2) Anxiety

I was supposed to present research we did on a project in Florida today. Everything was paid for by the university, including air fare and hotel. I knew my anxiety and heart would be major issues so I had my PCP prescribe Xanax in hopes that I would be able to fly. Long story short, I boarded the plane but had to leave cause my heart rate was so high and I was freaking out.

Basically, my research presentation went down the drain cause of my stupid health problems. I feel like a failure and loser for losing such a great opportunity. 

That is the icing on the cake of all the other horrible stuff that has happened recently. I donâ€™t really see the point in living anymore. Everyday I struggle with my heart condition and anxiety that makes me lose great opportunities. Whatâ€™s the point of living if I canâ€™t do anything.",depression_disorder

Since he's been gone, I have felt my depression slowly creeping back in. Every breath is an effort which makes my chest ache. Every step I take makes me feel like I'm tied to a car and I'm pulling deadweight. I haven't been able to get up from the bed for an entire day and I know I will not be able to, tomorrow either. If I walk I stumble and I'm not even drinking. Last week I had to sir down on the stairs of my university campus in order to not fall over, I felt like my heart would burst out of my chest the pain was so severe. I couldn't catch my breath.

It doesn't matter. I blocked her number and deleted our conversations. Just so I wouldn't be tempted.

But now I feel myself trying to isolate. It's not as bad as before, when I was severely depressed. Now it just stings. And now I am having a harder time believing that my friends will stick around.

this is basically just a hella confusing rant/ â€œshower thoughtsâ€ that prolly makes no sense. 

idk if this is just me, but idk if i really plan on living that long of a life. i would rather never have existed then have to experience something like dementia or alzheimerâ€™s when im older. iâ€™m not saying i have any plans to â€œoffâ€ myself at a certain age but i just donâ€™t think i wanna live for too long. kinda like we are here for a good time not a long time. it kinda makes me sad but then i think, from a universal perspective, my lifespan, which people say is short, but the longest thing we can experience, is equivalent to a blink of an eye. 80 years gone in a blink? Itâ€™s nothing but everything at the same time. if time is relative atleast, it doesnâ€™t matter if i â€œblinkâ€ a lil faster, idk what this means for my future, idk if one day iâ€™m gonna just give up, or stop taking care of myself or just stop everything, or maybe iâ€™ll keep going until iâ€™m meant to die. i donâ€™t believe in destiny, i believe in karma (relative) and things that happen are meant to. but destiny seems too irrelevant. iâ€™m not religious, so idk what to expect after death, im assuming there will be something however i donâ€™t rly believe in heaven or hell, for example if someone is raised or brought up in a harsh neighborhood and they had to steal food to survive, does that count as bad karma or just instinct? however i think the afterlife would be there as energy cannot be created nor destroyed, for all we know we are in a version of an afterlife right now. but idk where that will leave me and all my current experiences when i move on, even if my consciousness lives on, what abt my memories? did i forget another life? but that gets into reincarnation, which makes more sense then heaven and hell to me but i genuinly think the afterlife isnâ€™t really abt heaven or hell type of stuff, and wouldnâ€™t it need to exist? bc nothingness doesnâ€™t exist, if you properly think abt it our brains cannot process the idea of nothing, you may be thinking a white canvas or black void, well thatâ€™s still something. n it kinda all ties to where we came from, everyone has ther own theories but if we are using the big bang as an example, yeah that created the universe but how did it start and from where? anywyas i wnet completly off topic. my main goals in life is to live it to the fullest, take each day by day, have fun, and experience ego death. but iâ€™m not sure if i wanna live long yet. i donâ€™t want to die in hospice i would way rather go out in my own terms. but not in a say way just a here for a good time yk.

this probably won't even show up like half my posts on suicidewatch. just screaming into the void. why am I even taking antidepressants if they aren't going to cure the root of the problem. it's also super disheartening to find out other people with depression still find the energy to be hateful towards me. 

like obviously i wasn't expecting some deep bond over our shared depression lol but at the very least i wish people could just ignore me instead of putting me down. i talked to someone who had depression in an effort to just lend an ear and at first everything seemed okay. 

then when i told him i'm trans (this was not a fucking dating thing. it was literally just listening to someone vent. he's the one who asked my gender in the first place) he called me subhuman and to kms. 

idk why it cut deep today i guess i was just expecting someone to also suffer from depression to be a little more understanding about emotional pain. there is literally no escape. every single fucking place i go will have these people. i just want to disappear or be cis. this life is honestly a curse i sometimes wonder if i was the world's biggest misogynist in a past life to be suffering this way now. 

therapy and pills are useless for me. they will never fix this. they will never help me cope with this. it's all a waste of money that could be going towards food and rent and future surgery / gun license so i can shootmyself funds. why is this world so goddamn mean. i never did anything to these people. at the very least just talk shit about me behind my back.",depression_disorder

Today I'm dealing with loneliness, yet again, self doubt and fear of the future. Everything I did since I graduated high school feels like it was for nothing. I left everyone I met and I forgot half of the things I studied.  


I tired of feeling like this, when I watch someone else they seem to go through life like it was butter. Everyone has their struggles but It seems like they can live rather easily. When someone has a problem they usually confront it and fix it.

Since last year I feel like I have taken all the wrong choices in life and now I'm regretting them and paying the price. Everyday feels wrong, I keep wondering what if things went different, how would I be now? Would I be happy if in those days I said other things or acted a different way? It feels like I'm living in a parallel universe were things went wrong and I hate it.  


I'm so fucking lost in my life now, I don't know what I like, I don't know what job do I want to have, I don't know if I'm good at something, I feel like I'm going to feel alone for the rest of my days, happiness feels like a feeling that last a only few hours. 

I would love to be happy, love someone, have a group of friends that I can go out with more frequently, have a job that I like and that pays well, feel like I have a purpose in the world, have a phone full of messages again, wake up every day with energy, be more confident, feel like if there is something to do I can do it, without self doubt.

"In a world like this.  I don't see anything worth living for.  I've been alone for a little over a year, following two separate relationships in a row, both with women that had very clear signs of narcissistic personality disorder.  Both left me more broken than I already was.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't achieved anything academically since highschool.  I've finished a couple terms at community college.  I've worked some interesting jobs like wildland firefighting and fishing in alaska, but nothing I could make a career out of without breaking my body and essentially crippling myself by age 50.  I'm currently working on per-requisites for nursing school.  And I honestly don't know why I'm even trying.  It just seemed like a solid option financially.  I can't bring myself to actually try though.  My brain is determined to judge everything I do as a lost cause.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had no luck romantically.  I've only managed to find selfish people who would rather lie, cheat, and manipulate their way through every relationship they find themselves in.  Anytime I meet a new potential partner something gets in the way, or I get ghosted after a seemingly good connection up front.  I know I'm not ugly, although I have my issues I'm capable of being sociable and enjoyable to be around.  And I'm honest, I don't cheat or play games.  You'd think by 30 someone would have stuck around.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fairly liberal, but apparently anything less than antifa is too far right.  Multiple times in the last few months I've been I've been told ""we disagree on some things politically and I can't see myself with someone that I can't agree with on some of those issues"".  

&amp;#x200B;

For the record I'm not racist, I believe it's a woman's right to do what they want with their body, just to give you a snapshot of where I'm at politically. I almost always vote democrat even though I find both parties to be a fucking snake-pit.  I can't remember the last time I was proud to be an American.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't do it because of my family.  I wish I didn't have one.  I could have left years ago.  I can't bring myself to hurt them though.

&amp;#x200B;

Not overly interested in the ""live laugh love"" genre of advice, so please spare me the ""it gets better"".  I just need to vent.

Those around me getting into new romantic relationships. I've lost my appetite and started eating less. I'm spending a lot of my time re-teaching myself what it feels to be truly lonely since it's a familiar feeling. I live in my head mostly and dream of a better place. Gardens, sunshine and community, stuff like that. I've started to do some deep research into what it feels like to die and where people think we go afterwards.

recently i have been contemplating leaving home, i am 20 and currently working and going to school. everyday i get reminded how useless and unloved i am at home and theres nothing that i can do that will make my â€œegg donorâ€ think otherwise. i stopped regarding her as my mother after i finally stood up for myself. that very day she made me show a side of myself that i never wanted to go near making me yell violently and punch a hole in the wall out of frustration. after doing so i fell to the floor in tears, my heart has never hurt so much. but what did she do? walked away screaming and worrying about there being a fucking hole in the wall than her own son who is on the floor crying because of everything he has endured in and outside of home. i hate her for all that she has done to me. she is the reason for my alienation in my family. its as if im a punching bag for everything wrong in her life. my brothers never get shit but me. they dont even speak to me at all and its probably because of her. honestly they probably dont even consider me as their brother anymore. ive always tried my hardest and every single time i have a take on something its wrong until she hears the same thing i said from some stupid fucking online influencer. of course community college wasnt bad until someone else other than me said its a great place to attend. so much for calling your son a loser for attending one. its like whatever i say or do never gets acknowledged. my whole life from my childhood i was verbally abused by my â€œmotherâ€ for doing what i enjoy and love. its hard for me to even speak or do things with people because im afraid that im going to do something that would anger them regardless of who they are. home has never felt like home for the longest. even stepping foot inside my â€œhomeâ€ stresses me out. i mean shit, im even losing hair because of it as i speak. my supposed mother constantly threatens to kick me out and tells me to leave home for no reason whatsoever. i dont know what to do and i dont have anyone living in my state and neither do i want to give up school. all i want is for this headache i always have to finally go away.",depression_disorder

"I hate getting praise but I dont. I like that people think Iâ€™m doing good but at the same time I donâ€™t believe them. Iâ€™m 17 and I feel like Iâ€™ve been like this forever. Iâ€™m in grade 12 now and at the beginning of my math class I got a 58% on my test and I told my teacher and my parents I would do better and I did. I started getting 80s and 90s but I canâ€™t force myself to believe I earned them. I only got those good marks because he started marking easier and he made the tests easier, everyone else was getting better marks as well. In my wood shop class my teacher was calling my projects amazing and telling me how talented I was but in my head I knew heâ€™s just saying this because he feels obligated to and because everyone gets good marks in wood shop. When I was driving with my mom the other day ( I hate driving but Iâ€™ve been practicing more for my test in august) my step dad called her and she told him I was a great driver and it pissed me off, I didnt believe her and it felt like she only said to to make me feel but I didnâ€™t genuinely believe it and it didnâ€™t feel real. I didnâ€™t deserve any of the praise. Why does it matter that I got a 94% on my calculus test when I got a 50% on my physics test? Why does it matter that I didnt make that many mistakes when I drove home when I still did make mistakes? Why does it matter that my wood shop teacher said that my project is good when I know that thereâ€™s obvious mistakes and issues?

Why does it matter that Iâ€™m a bit stronger in the gym than some of my friends when Iâ€™m not getting much stronger and Iâ€™m still not that strong in comparison to other people my age?

"I just got out of the psych unit today after making an attempt to kill myself by cutting myself repeatedly. I needed several stitches, was in the ER for 6 hours, and the psych unit for a week. I'm more stable now, but after hearing that my parents got rid of my meds, I'm kinda freaking out.

They told me that my meds clearly aren't working and they think I'll only use them to OD. I've had a terrible relationship with my parents throughout my life (almost 22 years), but I'm a little surprised that they've gone this far. My dad has threatened to kill me in the past, so maybe I shouldn't be too shocked.

I am on quite a high dosage of 5 psych meds, so I know I'm going to have some bad withdrawal and serotonin syndrome. It's late where I'm at right now, and my psychiatry office is closed along with any pharmacies, but I know first thing in the morning tomorrow, I'll immediately call both.

But other than him, I talk to no one except the teachers whenever I have a question or if they call me in class to answer a question. And In all honesty, I don't know why this happened in the first place. If I remember correctly, my social issues started in the 8th grade. For some reason, I was very reserved and kept to my self always during that year and didn't speak to anyone, and I was often teased and sort of bullied for that. This behavior continued until today, in the 10th grade and it only has gotten worse. I think it's partly because of my preference in personality in my friends.

I donâ€™t live in Texas, I havenâ€™t heard of the town until today, but the only thing I want in life right now is to go there and hug every person I see. I just canâ€™t stop thinking about those kids. Little children of families.

"Man does this bother me a lot. A few times people I know have said this to me in either a joking or callous way, people I would consider friends, and it really hurt. It was enough of a reoccuring insult for me to notice that this is something they really do think about me.

If they mentioned this in a compassionate, sympathetic way, it wouldn't irritate me so much, but it's always been worded in this derisive or mocking way. Like this is something to be ashamed of, some for which I should be criticized.

I haven't hurt anyone. I don't try to overcompensate for anything. I've always tried to be friendly. I don't engage in putting others down to make myself feel better, like some of them have. I just have really low self-esteem and have struggled with major depression for, at this point, years.

You're essentially saying to me, ""You should dislike yourself for disliking yourself!"", and that's NOT helping. I definitely do hold myself back, but it's just so hard when all those little insults accumulate and ring in my mind. Am I childish for this? Am I immature? I don't know, maybe, probably, but I try to be a good person. I'm not callous. I'm suffering from horrible depression. Saying I'm ""insecure"" is such a derisive insult, like this is a failing on my part. You're just hurting me.

I don't know. I try not to be a resentful person. But often, I'm resentful of either others or myself. I want to be a good person. I don't know if I am. I just don't want to be this way. It's so hard to admit to myself that I may actually be ""insecure"" because of that derisive connotation. Maybe I am. Am I?

I don't want to victimize myself, but I'd also like for this pain to be acknowledged by people I actually know. I think I do want sympathy, I want it a lot, because it's just so rare for me to receive it. But at the same time, I don't acknowledge my depression frequently, so why should I expect this sympathy from others? I'm secretive about it.

Maybe I am a bad person. But that just continues this cycle of self-hatred. I don't hurt people, is that enough for me to be good? I'm tired of feeling like a bad person, of telling myself to commit suicide. I'm tired of feeling ashamed OF feeling ashamed of myself. It's a neverending cycle of misery that's hard to escape. It's suffocating.

Maybe I am a bad person, or maybe I'm just looking for sympathy. At least the latter is true. It's just so hard. I'm tired of feeling this way.",depression_disorder

but I don't feel bad. I know I'd be sad if I thought about these things. just typing this should make me sad. but it doesn't. I barely think about all these things anymore. and even if I do, I just don't care. I don't feel anxious, sad, or worried. I'm not *unhappy*.

but I'm not *happy* either. I'm not *fine.* but I'm not *not fine*.

I think my mind is blank.

It's like it hasn't sank in. reality hasn't hit me yet. I know it's coming soon. when it all dawns on me at once. guess I just need to wait in numbness 'til then.",depression_disorder

"I remember sitting in my garage inside of all the exhaust fumes.. and today.. I just.. wish that could've been it.  

I tried to see doctors, therapists, counselors.. I was rejected, told I couldn't be helped, accused of saying whatever I'd need to say to manipulate them.. and I even had one therapist tell me I should drink more.. and.. honestly, I have started drinking.. and getting high.

I tried to just say fuck it. And to try to live and just be happy with myself, and it worked. For awhile.  And I even made a couple of friends for a little bit.. but they have already moved on from me.

I'm so tired of just. Being so alone.  Not having someone real in my life that cares.. no friends that know how to listen.. no family.  All I have are coworkers and managers that make me feel insignificant, and put me into situations where I feel sabotaged.

I hate all of the memories I have that my brain forces me to play constantly in my head of the friends I used to have.. of the love I used to feel.  Of the care I used to give.

I don't know if I'll ever try again.. but.. I don't know how much more of this type of life I want to bear with.

"2 years ago I met this girl online and the day after I met her I woke up to a sucide noteâ€¦ after an hour of spam texting she replied saying she was okay then the rabid joke kept getting deeper we started dating December 21st 2020 and then it got deeper eventually on my birthday in July 2021 I just left. Durring our relationship we had a lot of fights and I blame myself for all of them she attempted sucide 100+ times failed every time. To this day I question if it was even real it drives me crazy I feel like Iâ€™m the one to blame for her attempts. More recently I started liking a girl and I got freind zoned by her and early may we got into a massive fight over me feeling used in our friendship. I commonly bought her food when we went out and she made really mean comments towards me but I let it all slide because well I loved her. Skip to June we ended up making up because Iâ€™m just too nice and she got bullied so I offered her a seat so she wasnâ€™t near her bullyâ€™s after that we became freinds again and I blame myself for her saying she hated herself and everything that happend to her. Skip ahead to tonight, Iâ€™m sitting in my bed listening to music and I sorta feel like Iâ€™m not myself anymore I never cried I havenâ€™t cried through mental pain in 3 years not even when my favorite teacher left our school.

" Depression is often treated with a series of medications and aggressive therapies to resolve the biochemical imbalances that accompany this health challenge. Antidepressants typically help to normalize brain chemicals called neurotransmitters (such as sertonin, norepinephrine and dopamine) to regulate mood though this claim is often disputed.

"Iâ€™ve (M25) never completely experienced complete isolation. Itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve always been terrified of, but at the same time itâ€™s very present in my life already, just not the fullest extent of it. My fear of isolation has caused me to make a lot of dumb decisions. I keep toxic people in my life because I depend on them. If I didnâ€™t have them, Iâ€™d have no one and having no one is just a really scary thought to think about. Iâ€™m so close to complete isolation already because I donâ€™t have any outlets a normal person has. For example, I work in my car as a delivery driver so I donâ€™t have any coworkers, I donâ€™t go to university either, or the gym, or any social group/club beyond the internet. I know a lot of you are in the same spot as I am. Iâ€™d like to know what itâ€™s like if I chose to cut ties with the last person Iâ€™m in contact with. Her and I donâ€™t want the same things in our relationship and itâ€™s gotten to a point where Iâ€™m starting to self harm again, so I know keeping her around isnâ€™t healthy. Iâ€™m just so scared of being alone. I donâ€™t wanna face this but I know I have to. I have to leave her and risk the results of total isolation. What even happens when youâ€™re isolated for long amounts of time? Humans supposedly need connection in their lives right?

"Not having a cry for attention or wanting a response, just maybe saying these â€œout loudâ€ might help me.

So was enjoying the day at work, until sometime after lunch when the conversation of the guys working next to me changed to sex stories. While trying to think of lies in case they ask me, i had a think back to my past. Iâ€™m a sweet hearted loser, practically virgin (thats why needed lie), lonely, over weight, only had bad relationships, and really have no motivation for the future. Wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m suicidal, but have once gotten to the point of not wanting to live but didnâ€™t progress further because someone needs to take care of my dog. Iâ€™ve just had enough of feeling this way. Health is shit cause dieting not worth the struggle when delicious food is one of my few joys. I pretend that i drink socially for fun but its just to drown the moods. Sometimes when riding my bike Iâ€™d either excessively speed or close my eyes and count because its a thrill and death doesnâ€™t terrify me. Iâ€™m a bit of a shut in, I donâ€™t want to be but past experiences have really fucked up my ability to trust and opening up honestly. Usually when i get this way i tend to try to persuade sad to anger. But thats just makes it worst, cause then Iâ€™d be â€œshifting to blameâ€ and doesnâ€™t resolve my depression. Because of all this i wanted a knife instead of a paint  brush when it all started at work today. When i got home (hour ago) in my attempt to resolve my mood my thoughts mostly focused around a particular date and wishing it never happened. Sure i met people who i hated a year later and that the neg out weighs the pos since then. However, canâ€™t blame the past, caused id have been lonely without experience and you can only take things as a learning curve to build character (hate that saying but its true). So, Iâ€™m going to try and not be such a baby, get over it and stop saying no to things. I canâ€™t just keep repeating the same behaviour thats causing my depression or iâ€™ll go insane .",depression_disorder
"My friend Sam (45m) is having a really hard time right now. About 4 years ago he lost a job he really liked this led to him drinking. It started with like a glass or two of wine but moved to a bottle then four. During that time he lost a good friend and struggled to find something in his field. He has a bachelors in psychology and communications but works in tech, when asked why he doesnâ€™t just do something else he has a list of excuses. The main one being that he doesnâ€™t want to switch fields for that pay cut and heâ€™s too old to switch fields. 

Over the four years heâ€™s become just a husk. This last year has been the worst though. Sam after not shaving or cutting his beard for three years decided to do that and start his own company. Thereâ€™s a catch though if it doesnâ€™t work by December, he will no longer be with us. This is after two failed attempts.

I know this is awful to say but heâ€™s being a major dick. If anyone says anything about him being a dick he automatically responds that itâ€™s not his fault and if anyone pushes for an apology weâ€™re bullying someone whoâ€™s vulnerable. So the only person who really talks to him is his mom, stepdad, and me. We want to support him but heâ€™s making it very hard.

"TW: self harm

Iâ€™ve lost 60 pounds this year from working out, Iâ€™ve eaten healthy for month, I kept a solid sleep schedule, Iâ€™ve made friends and been social, Iâ€™ve kept gratitude journal after gratitude journal, I was on meds for 7 years, and in therapy for 10.

I want to enjoy things again. I used to love doing things and I used to have a good memory and I didnâ€™t feel my heart freeze and shatter every single time I experienced the finest negative thing. All I feel now is jealousy and resentment that maybe I could have gotten better if Iâ€™d been taken seriously or if Iâ€™d put me and my needs first instead of bending over backwards, or being vulnerable and it being for nothing. 

I need things to get better. I want my therapist to believe me when I say that I feel like my souls died decades ago, and to be held every night and told Iâ€™m ok and Iâ€™m wanted, and for people to stop thinking I cut because itâ€™s an addiction or obsession when really itâ€™s not and every slice is a reminder, like when you tie a string around your finger to remember you have to go get your laundry out of the washer at 5. This slice means remember that youâ€™re not wanted and donâ€™t forget it or youâ€™ll just hurt more later on.

Wanted to share a moment that just fueled my depression.

Riding my bicycle, jamming to tunes. RED LIGHT. A woman stops aside me, and shares that sheâ€™s been following me because she likes the music Iâ€™m listening to.

*Running through my mind already is she could be the one that changes everything*

I respond with what I can remember, as a thanks, Iâ€™ve been listening to this genre for a whole and Iâ€™m fully immersed in it.

*sheâ€™s still there, light is still red*

So, where are you headed? I asked her. She said to work. I said me too, and I mentioned where I work. Where do you work? I asked her.

*green light*

Now, I have some visible tattoos that arenâ€™t that inviting, nothing gory, just enough to get that â€œOh, this guy has gone through something in his lifeâ€ or â€œHeâ€™s crazy for sureâ€.

She proceeds to speed off and totally bites the side of the curb with her ankle and stops in the middle of the intersection. I pulled over to see if she was okay, and she shrugged it off â€œIâ€™m fineâ€.

A ways down the road sheâ€™s stopped at another light and I can see her checking out her ankle. I ask are you sure youâ€™re good? 

*Yes*

"Been on Fluoxetine for 20 yrs and recently went off them. Maybe bad timing but I am between Doctors at the moment, it kind of prompted me to go off them because I didnt want tot rush to find another Doctor. My Doctor dumped me after 12 years and I am effed up about that but its another story I suppose. Covid has changed medical practices a lot and the support that used to be there is now a quick numbers push through I think, I dont want to go to a clinic that just ushers you through like cattle.

So struggling on my own and it just hit me today, wow I just became me from 20 yrs ago. Anxiety, body pain, crying uncontrollably, couldnt even get through to my old Doctor on the phone cos of crying. Victim ideology, blaming all my family for my feelings. What the hell, pills were keeping all this at bay? Is this the real me? I was doing so well for so long and I cant believe a pill was the cause of all my contentedness. I don't want to go back on anti depressants. I want to see if this evens out and I can be balanced without pills. I want to ask a Doctor if this is normal, like a pendulum swing that will even out.

Tapered off my pills over a month so did it very slowly and did not notice any ill effects until the last few days, feeling like I had flu then whammo today I just lost it completely. Surely this is not the way it goes? Am I the balanced happy person on anti depressants or am i this mess that I remember from years ago,

sorry I dont really expect like an answer, I just couldnt get myself together enough today to reach out and get support. I will be making an Doctors appt next week but even that messes with my head, they all want uyou to have a phone app these days and I dont have a mobile.

"Over the past 4 years, my life has descended into fucking hell.

2018 was the happiest year of my life â€“ I met my wife, the most amazing woman in the world, I had a high-paying job, hopes for the future, a promising career. There were hobbies, hobbies â€“ it really was the best year. I look at a man smiling at me from a photo dated August 2018 and realize that he is happy.

This photo was the last happy photo â€“ after it my immersion began.

The management at work changed, they literally started squeezing me out of it â€“ they cut my salary by 2 times, deliberately detained me at work. In January 2019, I just had to quit. At the same moment we found out that my wife got pregnant. I got a new job, but the salary was no longer as high.

It turned out that we were expecting twins. It was the most difficult pregnancy, the most difficult childbirth. In the womb, one child was infected with an intestinal infection (doctors' mistake), and his brother also hit him on the head. The blow led to the fact that he received cerebral palsy.

Months of intensive care. Damn, I can't even formulate everything that's in my head properly. And the endless treatment and rehabilitation for a child with cerebral palsy began. We have no relatives, there is absolutely no one to help us, and I had to take endless leave from work, which did not contribute to a normal attitude towards me there.

The child will never be able to walk, the child will not be able to eat solid food â€“ every day I heard more and more cruel sentences from doctors.

Even then it became clear that the wife would never be able to work again, that she would have to take care of the child all her life. We began to collapse - all our money began to go to treatment, we stopped buying new clothes, began to walk in rags and eat bad food. We began to save in everything, my wife let herself down â€“ she gained an incredible amount of kilograms, fell into a severe depression, became aggressive and angry. I can understand her, and I just keep quiet.

I stopped smiling, my face was covered with wrinkles, and I became silent. From an incredibly popular, handsome and stylish guy with prospects, I became nobody â€“ a sullen, unsociable sad person who lost everything in general. Even then, for me, life was hell on earth.

In August 2021, the patience of the management ran out, and I can understand them â€“ I would also not keep a person at work who is not at work for a week every month (it does not matter that this right is provided by law and it does not matter that the reasons are valid). I was fired again.

Of course, I immediately found a new job, because we already had nothing to eat. The treatment continued, we swore, the child only got a little better â€“ now he can move on the snags, but this is his maximum.

Endless quarrels, lack of food, depression over the baby â€“ all this was killing us. We just exist, not live.

Now I am being fired again, because no one in this world is interested in the fact that we have two children, we need treatment all the time, there are simply no relatives to sit with the second child.

I tried to earn money as much as I could â€“ in addition to my main job, I sold things on the streets, handed out leaflets, unloaded wagons at night, but debts still grew, as everything went to treatment.

I fucking learned Python to implement a project for the Nintendo Switch, which seemed promising to me, I hoped to get at least enough money at the expense of it to close the debts. I have received thousands of users of the project, popularity and gratitude, but only $ 100 in donations. If every user donated at least a dollar, I would solve all our problems, yes, but no one wants to help anyone, no matter how happy they are with the project.

I do not know how to live with all this. I'm hungry all the time. No one will ever help us, nothing. I have no hobbies left, no one needs me at home, anywhere, I feel sorry for the child. I cry all the time. No matter what I do, it doesn't change anything. I'm tired, I don't rest and I work all the time, but nothing changes. I've always worked hard, I've always helped everyone I could help, always! But no one will help me, no one needs me.

I do not know why I wrote all this, because you can't help me either. It's over and we won't be happy. I do not know why I am writing all this, because there is nothing you can do either.

I'm tired of fighting.",depression_disorder
"Hi , my name is Angel Govekar a 23 year old girl living in India who is currently pursuing a medical degree from a private college. 

I see toxic people here belonging to rich high class societies whether it be daughter/son of a politician or any form of administration which gives a lot of power and money to the family. 

 Talking about me, both of my parents are experieneced doctors my mother is a physician while my dad is an ophthalmologist in govt practice so they dont earn that much compared to the people i mentioned above. 


This is also a college which is far from my hometown so i live in hostel.

I understand that and so i attend my classes without fail, dont go out of the campus to even enjoy myself and try to save as much as i can, like a good daughter. 

But no matter what you do how good you are. People are just not happy and same is with everyone and even my family. 

They never praised me for any of my achievements and just brushed me off when i needed some money for my necessities i literally have to beg for everything on call. 

The reason why im writing this post is because i feel alone with no support now that i know even my family thinks of me as a patient with a mental disorder ( my mom said that to me on call just now) yeah i used to take antidepressants for 7 years but then i tried to cope up and stopped taking them well they on the contrary wanted me to take it for the lifetime. 

Ill end this post with a scenario which happened with me yesterday you tell me if its fair on their part or not. 

If you find it hard to pay your daughter even 500 rupees (6.32$) for her necessities is it worthwhile to spend 14,500 rupees (183.41$) on a plane ticket just to see me? I would never agree on them to pay such a high amount just for me. But they said that i told them ( yes i told them to visit me but by paying such a high amount? ) when im deprived of it myelf. It makes no sense at all.

"I finally achieved everything I wanted in life then last year I got diagnosed with severe systemic inflammation. I had so many issues but the worst of it being inflammatory arthritis. Iâ€™m on the strongest medication (chemo) and itâ€™s barely making a difference yet I have so many side effects from it. I canâ€™t leave my house because of the pain, Iâ€™ve maybe left 5 times in the last year. Itâ€™s destroying my bones and Iâ€™m watching myself deteriorate by the day.

These last couple days have been.. less than great, you could say. Parted ways with my dad after a lifetime worth of abuse, split apart from my (now ex) boyfriend, havenâ€™t been able to see friends since school has let out, etc.

Todo mi objetivo en la vida era conseguir lo imposible y lo lograba, siempre dejaba asombrada a la gente con lo que hacia. Joserra eso es imposible ! y yo decia que nada lo era y lo demostraba. Si me quedaba atrapado dentro de una corriente a 300 metros de la costa, salia nadando, si suspendia haciendo novillos todas las asignaturas, las recuperaba todas (15 suspensas, 15 recuperadas el mismo aÃ±o), si me pegaba alguien mas grande que yo, lo derribaba y ganaba, asi con todo como os podeis imaginar. 

Sacaba 10 en tecnologia, biologia,  historia y todas las ciencias utiles (Sin embargo odiaba la puta fisica y sus matematicas avanzadas estupidas hechas de formas que solo entiendes, estudiando a ciertos tipos)  y en los demas un 5 o un 6 (porque no me interesaba ni estudiaba si soy sincero, porque  me daba igual)

Me saque la carrera, despues de que me expulsaran de la Universidad, ya que tuvieron que admitir que mi investigacion tenia razon y que la yo habia denunciado, era la incorrecta (tardaron uun 1 aÃ±o y me readmitieron, a regaÃ±adientes, para al final terminar la carrera con un 8,5)

Pero al final pa que?

Tengo 26 aÃ±os, vivo en casa de unos padres que me odian, Kenshi ha borrado de mi cabeza todos los recuerdos felices y se ha cargado mi modo de ver en la vida, que era que todo era perder o ganar.

De escribir la \`\`Mentira de las NacionesÂ´Â´ a hacer mierdas de investigaciones sobre la Guerra de Independencia de Texas, que no importa a nadie (8, 5 y me dijeron que con la Mentira de las Naciones hubiera sacado Matricula de honor, me lo dijeron los mismos que me expulsaron y que no quisieron mi tfg)

No puedo imaginar nada, solo pesadilllas

He perdido todos mis trabajos y ya ni me aceptan en gasolineras

he perdido la puta cabeza y no recuerdo nada

Tengo Anhedonia, Bulimia, Depresion Severa, Alucinaciones, Despersonalizacion y todo un cumulo de enfermedades mentales que me van a matar un dia de un derrame cerebral. 

Platino del Lol a Bronce y Hierro. (No puedo prestar atencion a nada y solo me salen trols, ayer perdi 21 partidas seguidas, 21). 

Platino en Magic the Gathering a bronce. (parece tonteria, pero antes disfrutaba Magic)

Esto hoy ya ha sido la gota que colma el vaso.

Mi hermana me supera en todos los ambitos posibles.

Tiene amigos, trabajo, sabe cantar, es guapa, sabe pintar, dibujar (lo unico que no sabe es escribir, pues se le da de puta pena, mas robotica que un vibrador) 

Mis padres me estuvieron pegando palizas hasta los 21 aÃ±os (cuando empeze a defenderme)

Tambien abusaron de mi psicologicamente de todas las forma sposibles, solo les falto la sexual pero al parecer tienen un limite en eso.

Todas las chicas que me gustan me odian, todas a las que odio, les gusto por un motivo que no alcanzo a comprender. Ahora 3 aÃ±os despues, no he visto una mujer que no sea mi hermana o mi madre. O al menos no estado mas de 5 minutos con una mujer, cuando antes siempre salia con chicas, para cualquier cosa, desde amigos a vivir aventuras locas, de recogerlas en la calle y ayudarlas, a basicamente emborrame con ellas mientras jugabamos a videjuegos y leiamos mierda de libros. Nunca me atrajo la parte sexual, soy asi de raro. Solo queria estar con alguien y las chicas solian ser mas amables y abiertas. Conmigo solian sentirse seguras. Ahora soy un  gordo cabron, con ojos muertos, pelo caido y dientes amarillos, cuando antes estaba fuerte y delgado y las chicas me tocaban los ricitos y la melena (eso es lo que mas hecho de menos).

Me han llegado a proponerseme homosexuales cuandoe era joven, pese a que no lo soy (y uno de hecho se extralimito intentando tocarme el pene y le pegue un guantazo). No les odio, pero odio me consideren uno de los suyos, porque no me gusta el sexo homosexual y estaba harto de echarlos para atras, ya que muchos estaban bastante desesperados por follar y eran muy besucones.

Estoy harto de vivir encerado entre 4 paredes de mierda y cuando salgo a la calle es 1 de 4.

1. Todo parece como el videjuego Kenshi, vacio y sin sentido. COmienzan las alucinaciones.
2. Todo es apagado y la luz me hace daÃ±o a los ojos. Mis ojos intentan ver pero no pueden, me desmayo si hace mucho calor y apenas puedo respirar.
3. Dado que un bulgaro de mierda y su amiguo me partieron la nariz y la garganta en una residencia, ahora no puedo correr ni respirar y he engordado 50 kilos. Si salgo a la calle, noto como mis lorzas y mi barriga se salen de la camiseta y aunque me duche (me suelo duchar por culpa de esto hasta 2 veces al dia) y por mucho suaviante, champu y colonias que me ponga, estoy tan gordo que exudo un olor francamente repugnante hasta para mi mismo. Mi cuerpo no esta acostumbrado a esta gordura, mi madre no para de atocinarme y me duelan ya todas las partes del cuerpo, pero no puedo parar de comer porque la depresion me ha quitado todo y es la unica recompensa minima que tengo al parecer, comer hasta reventar. 
4. Intento reirme, me empieza a dolor la cabeza como si me clavaran un cuchillo, con aguijonazos constntes de dolor. Algo me gusta, bostezo, ahora mismo mi mente esta intentando bloquear esto que escribo, porque creo sinceramente que mi propio cerebro esta intentando matarme, porque me impide tener dopamina o alegrarme de las cosas que me alegraban antes. Siento dolor todo el dia, por favor, que alguien haga que pare, quiero llorar y no puedo, todos me odian y estoy CANSADOOOOOOOOOO JODERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

JODERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

DIOS POR FAVOR, NECESITO AYUDA, LO QUE SEA, SOLO QUIERO PARAR DE PENSAR EN KENSHI Y EN ESOS HIJOS DE PUTA, Y VOLVER A HACER EL DE ANTES

PORQUE COJONES NO PUEDO GANAR, PORQUE SIEMPRE TENGO QUE PERDE,R ESTOY HASTA LA MIERDA YA HOMBRE.

PORQUE NO PUEDO SER EL MEJRO PUTAAAAAAAAAAAAA MIERDAAAAAAAAA DE VIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA JODEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR",depression_disorder

"I've been so depressed for about a couple of months now. I'm managing to brush my teeth and aside from a few very basic life maintenance, I've barely done anything. My mind has been a battle field and my body like a train ran over it. All I really wanna do is get into and stay in bed but I know that'll make me weaker. So while I'm eating I'm managing to stay upright to lessen the toll on my body. I've been going out ocassionally but being in such mess I've been avoiding it and limiting my time out. My hair has become so matted that I'm considering doing almost a big chop because I barely have any strength left in me. But the thought of cutting it also makes me so sad that in trying to muster what energy I can to save it. If I can get my hair fixed and washed, I can start going to the doctor to figure out what's happening with me. I know I've been under immense stress lately but maybe I also have vitamin deficiencies and I've also been relatively isolated. I met someone who has been wanting to hangout though I've been avoiding him because I'm just such a mess. So little to no social life. Everything is a mess and I'm just trying to get it together. Just trying to keep up with brushing my teeth has been a struggle. I'm trying to make sure I push myself through brushing my teeth at the very least. I've been eating and washing my hands, so no worries in regards to that. I'm not sure what I'm hoping to get out of this post, it's probably just a vent. I managed to get my hair deranged almost completely a while ago. Then I feel into another bout of depression and exhaustion, that I couldn't follow up with washing and doing protective styling. Right now after my meal I just wanna wash my hands, put the plate in the sink filled with water and get into bed. Though I'm gonna try to push myself and see if I can start detangling some of my hair. I don't want this to be the hundredth night that I let my exhaustion take over. ðŸ˜©  ðŸ˜­",depression_disorder
"But does anyone ever feel like such a burden because your death is going to cause the people you care about pain? Or does anyone ever pray that they die before their loved ones die so you don't have to experience the pain of losing them? If so, what's is this called and is it normal? Cause when I tell my mom this, she dismisses me. And tells me to relax",depression_disorder
"I think back to before my boyfriend, before college, before high school, before even that. I just keep wondering when whatâ€™s I ever happy. Started drinking at 12 always had a problem. Drinking caused problems drugs caused problems I caused problems. For always.",depression_disorder
