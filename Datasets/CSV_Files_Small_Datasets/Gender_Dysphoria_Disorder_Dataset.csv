"Hi

Bit of a loaded question really since given the size of our community I'm sure someone else has.

I've really struggled trying to find a way to express how I felt about my own gender issues. I've had them for years and years now, but at the same time I've rarely showed outward evidence of femininity in my daily life. My parents are quite suspicious of my desire to transition because of this. Despite how I might look I'm not always the most feminine person but I know that if I chose to take pride in my appearance then I'd definitely wear feminine clothes.

I don't quite feel 100% female, or even 100% male for that matter; I'm either a bit of both or neither. But honestly I'd much rather be perceived as female in day to day life than male and guess I feel like my life could be better and more true to myself as a woman. Having breasts feels ""right"" somehow.

On the times I have worn more masculine clothes or grown out my facial (more for necessity than anything else--my face hates being regularly shaved!) I've just felt like my body isn't my own. Honestly it feels like I've had such a poor awareness of what I actually look, act or sound like for years. I tend to daydream and spend large amounts of time ""in my own head"", which might be one reason why I have problems with disorganization and lack mindfulness. One hypothesis I've thought up is that my brain has blocked recognition of myself to kind of spare me the truth. 

That sounds a bit too dramatic perhaps, but I think there's still truth in it. Now that I've made up my mind to transition fully this year I feel overwhelmed by the thousands of things that I need/may need to do and gender dysphoria has hit me *big* time (mostly in feeling massively jealous of cis women I work with). I've been down this road before to some extent, and every time I've made progress on trans issues it feels like this dysphoria comes screaming at me and has caused me endless problems in my work and personal life. So I *have* to get it sorted by transitioning.

"Hi everyone, I have a question for you all today.  One thing that my therapist and I often talk about is coming out of my comfort zone.  I love trying new things, telling her about what I did, and posting about it on here.  I'm not on hormones yet, just to let you all know.

In the past I have bought dresses in public, and I have worn dresses in public.  But I'm not sure what else I can do.  The reason that I do things like this is because it's great for self-discovery, not to mention confidence.

Do the rest of you all have any suggestions on what I can do to go out of my comfort zone and explore my transness?

Thanks!",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I just have a few questions. I am finally starting my transition this year. 

Questions
1: when I start estrogen will my a libido be completely crazy? I am on testosterone injections now and I'm going to stop them.

2. What all will the estrogen help me with as far as body. Hair, facial hair, etc.?

3. I am balding, so I will have to wear wigs. Will I look fake?

Anything else I might need to know, y'all let me know.

Thank Kassandra.",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"This has been my career goal for a long time. I'm almost done with my undergrad. All of these trans feelings recently clicked and a bunch of memories unrepressed themselves. I was hoping there might be others here with similar career goals. I'm trying to fight off this weird feeling that if I am trans, I won't be able to find a teaching job or even finish my degree. 

These fears completely irrational, I know, but I'm still scared for some reason. ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Reading a lot about gender dysphoria and online tests re: transgender identity. I realize that while I (AMAB) have recently begun intermittently fantasizing about being a woman, I don't have any negative feelings about my life prior to these fantasies. 

I actually really like my life, and would call myself a happy person, and find a lot of meaning and joy in the things I do and relationships I have. 

But for some reason I've recently been imagining what life would be like if I were a woman. See a dress, wonder how I'd look in it. Would want to look nice so I'd need a more feminine silhouette, and so then I wonder what my options are for that. I'm still not unhappy with my body at all but at the same time, the idea of exploring a feminine body is exciting. But I don't know why. I'm not sure if it is sexual I can't really tell. I generally like my penis quite a bit except when it's being difficult. But I'm sure I would want to be attractive as a woman, because I think I am attractive as a man.

Has anyone felt this way before realizing they were Trans? 

Is there something I can  read online to help myself understand these things? Is there another forum I should be looking at? 

Thank you very much for your patience.

Without make up i get a few looks ocassionaly anyway is my point...would someone who passes in San Francisco, Pass in somewhere more conservative?

"I've been on HRT since July, and I've noticed an increase in my sexual thoughts.  I was never really all that sexual, I guess it was a combination of low testosterone and not feeling comfortable with myself.  I've never *hated* my penis, it was really the test of my body that I took issue with.

Now that I'm on estrogen, though, my sex drive is getting stronger little by little.  The only problem is that when I think about sex, my penis is nowhere to be found.  I'm quickly going from considering never getting SRS to wishing I could just go get it this afternoon.

I could try some anal stuff, but I've done it in the past and it never quite satisfied me.  I'm starting to get more frustrated by it with every day that passes.

I guess my question is: whyyyyyyyyy?",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"Hi Reddit. 

Been thinking about my identity recently and thinking I might be trans. I was getting really excited about it and imagining what it would be like to have srs and have sex as woman, then I read something which kicked me in the stomach.

Basically last year I was circumcised due to a case of phimosis. I wasn't questioning my gender then so I didn't factor SRS into the equation. Now I'm scared that I might not be able to get SRS done or even enjoy having sex as a woman :(.

Ladies, do you know if there's still hope? Even if there is enough there for surgery, would I be able to get any enjoyment or stimulation and be able to orgasm?

"Iâ€™ve really started questioning things as of late. In the past, Iâ€™ve pondered about how Iâ€™d feel being the opposite gender, but my conclusion was always â€œany desire I have to be the opposite gender is likely due to some misguided belief that it would magically solve all my problems.â€ But then recently, I was doing some random introspection and thought, â€œwhat if becoming the opposite gender doesnâ€™t have to magically solve all my problems, but it just makes me happy? Isnâ€™t that enough?â€ It was like I had been staring at an optical illusion incorrectly the whole time and suddenly I started seeing things from a different (and perhaps correct) angle, freaking out, etc. Iâ€™ve always had super low esteem and a negative body image, Iâ€™ve always disliked my face and body (not necessarily whatâ€™s between my legs though), and when I think of what I could do to achieve an appearance that makes me happy, I canâ€™t think really think of anything with my current gender, just some unattainable attractive image of the opposite gender. These are pretty recent developments so Iâ€™m not making any rash decisions. And sure, combing through my life experiences and such, there have been some potential signs, but I know itâ€™s possible Iâ€™m just looking for anything that could be used as possible evidence. Still, a few of random questions came to my head, and I was wondering if people could answer them.

1. I already see a therapist for depression. However hesitant, I know I will have to bring up my above concerns with them eventually, even if Iâ€™m not actually trans. Would I likely get switched to a therapist who deals specifically in gender issues? Iâ€™m fairly positive my depression isnâ€™t solely due to gender identity stuff, and I quite like my current therapist, so I was just wondering.

2. People who have siblings of the same gender that theyâ€™re/theyâ€™ve transitioning/transitioned to: I know HRT is a process, but did you eventually find yourself looking similar to your siblings of that gender? The idea of possibly being trans is pretty scary, but tbh transitioning and looking like my siblings of the opposite sex is almost just as scary (in a bad way).

3. Is it possible to not think you were assigned/born the wrong gender at birth, but maybe that youâ€™re just better suited to live life as the opposite gender?

Thanks. I lurk on here once in a while, and it always seems like this is a great and helpful community.

"TL;DR first to avoid thumb exercise scrolling :P --i have two reasons to believe i have horrid self worth.  

* 1, im very submissive socially, and it feels like i have a sort of dog-ish begging attitude when it comes to social relations, without trying. like the only way to get mens attention is to beg, as its how i came to see myself i think, probably from getting mentally beat down and shunned by men and from trying to be one and epicly failing (in the bedroom yes sure im submissive, tho im probably switch, but that's different)
* and 2, i feel dumb. like, unable to socialize and do things, and doubt myself and such.


I've realized i have a very disparaging view of myself, which probably started around kindergarten.   i tried so hard to fit in with the jocky guys during elementary school, but never did.  i came to see femininity as bad and taboo and submissive, as 'this is what you are if you're not man enough to be a man', but yet its what i naturally seem to like (though i doubt myself, doubt that my personal transness is any more than autogynephilic arousal--despite agreeing that ray blanchard's theories are bunk--hell they dont even account for bi- to pansexuality, which i think i might be in some form)

i really believe i related my femininity with mental retardation, and now i can't progress mentally and emotionally and socially.  maybe this sounds crazy, but hear me out, if you want to. since coming out, and going to see 4 different therapists, ive been unable to access my emotions, and been unable to follow things socially, when interacting with the therapist.  its like i somehow block my awareness to somehow protect myself from being myself, which is totally insane but i think its what i do so that i will keep being what my dad expected of me, what friends thought of me, what society demanded of me.  and the interesting thing is, 3 of 4 therapists have suggested i have aspergers.  now, maybe i do, that's entirely possible, but there are a few reasons i dont think i do.  

* for one, im not the same as i was before coming out.  ive changed mentally--a *lot*. took antidepressants, those fogged my brain, am on hormones--cant really feel how they affect me other than slightly more sensitivity on the rare occasions that i feel emotional reactions, and just had some terrible experiences with marajuana before coming out (which i have since stopped using) 
* for another, all my relatives that ive asked have said that i didn't seem to have aspergers. in fact, my cousin in-law (i forget the technical term for that) works with people diagnosed with aspergers, and she said that i dont have any of the traits. she believes its just social anxiety. 

so that, and seeing how other cis women are, have made me realize that i dont value my self worth at all, and i would like to change that. ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

Currently my question list is:

1. What is your policy on transgender health, do you follow the informed consent model, or a traditional gatekeeping model
2. Should I get some sort of test for Klinefelter syndrome?
3. (Assuming 1 is a yes on IC Model) Can I go ahead and sign those forms?

"Alright so hello.   
I'm MtF and I'm just having issues. I'm at the stage of ""am i trans"" now I was pretty certain for awhile that I was,and still kind of am.

I don't know know what to think anymore, I'm not happy being a male but if I were to transition I'd basically be homeless and disowned by my family and not see my child ever again. Now I know for sure I still like girls so I'd just be a les, which I think would make my parents the most mad. (Yes ""relegious reasons"")

"So... this just got real...
I've been on hrt for 2 weeks now as an experiment and I'm looking for some research to confirm my findings. Basically my anxiety and depression have been taken down about five notches each and I can feel normal emotions again, it's wonderful! As a downside my mood swings are now huge. I almost cried because someone gave me a compliment. Before I couldn't cry at all.

But, is there even any evidence to support this? Is it really as simple as: ""feel better? you're trans. feel worse? you're cis.""? Is it just a placebo? I'm not even sure it's working since I've experienced only minimal physical effects. I think my skin might be softer? Body hair is just as prominent, libido is unchanged (still zero), My non-boobs don't hurt.

More worryingly, shit just got real. I'm not strong. I don't think I can transition. I mean I can't really be a man either; I've skated by this far on luck, mostly.

"**EDIT: This is for MtF. Sorry for confusion!**

I know that HRT is a YMMV type thing, but I wanted to ask a few more details than just the typically stated things like soft skin, breasts, fat redistribution, etc.

The more specific questions I'd to like to ask about:

1: Is there a change in vein definition? I have horribly pronounced veins, especially my hands which to say the least causes a good amount of dysphoria for me...

2: Muscle mass, does it start to decrease considerably just being on HRT? Or will it require dieting for it? My neck especially (which is quite thick... D':) is very bothersome to me (among so many other places but you get the point).

3: I know that fat will be redistributed to more of your legs, butt, and to your breasts, but how much does this really change you? My butt looks nothing like a cis-woman butt, even those who are lean and have a similar amount of mass as me, is this more to do with bone structure or fat distribution?

4: How much does your body hair change? This seems especially YMMV dependent but I have cis-girl friends that have no visible body hair besides lower legs, arm-pits, and pubic area, and these are butch girls who do no shaving or anything, is it common to get to this little amount of body hair once on HRT for a while even if I have visible dark hair on most of my body? (The amount of time I spend shaving is unreal). Will that all eventually become peach fuzz/generally unnoticeable like most cis-girls?

5: Does your voice and facial hair really not change at all? I understand the voice situation and how that works so I am mostly expecting that yeah no voice change but figured I would ask. With Facial hair however, I would think that there would be at least some difference... I have heard so many trans girls say that they notice no difference in facial hair? It doesn't even grow lighter or slower? I have to shave my face everyday to not have obvious dark patches and twice a day if I want to keep it like that for the day, and my face is sensitive so that is really hard on it. (and I don't even have that much facial hair) Is that something that won't change at all once on HRT not even slowed growth? I know I'll pretty much have to get Electrolysis eventually, but I just wanted some shared experiences on that...

I am also very curious on the different mental changes that come along with HRT which sound like one of the best parts, but I am sure that it is too YMMV dependent to get a good expectation on what I can expect for myself...

I am prepared to just hear that all of these are still just YMMV, but I would at least like to hear some of your own personal experiences with the questions provided. Thanks so much!! &lt;3",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"I just wanna share this life event so that others that may not have come out yet may find the courage to do so. You may want to check my post history for some context, but, essentially, when I first came out to my mom, it didnâ€™t go so well: I thought she would be accepting, but it proved to be quite difficult for her: she gave me quite the hard time, but I kind of understand why she all did it.

As for my father I thought he would never accept me and that he would mock me for wanting to be myself: a woman. Thing is, my perception was completely wrong.

My father is only home half of the year (he travels abroad for his job) so when he came back he noticed something was different about me: I wasnâ€™t as energetic as usual, I wasnâ€™t motivated, I never smiled... I love to paint and made a painting of a pink woman in a blue cage shaped like the body of man. When he noticed the painting he started to question it and well, since iâ€™m not a good liar I was just all like â€˜â€™Oh that.. itâ€™s nothing *insert really convincing face*â€™â€™. Two days later, he came down in my room with my mom and closed the door: that moment, I knew shit was about to go down.

He told me he had a good idea of what the painting represented: that I was a woman trapped in a manâ€™s body. I said nothing and just stared at the wall wondering if my mom had outed me. Then, he said it: my mom had not said a thing. Following his noticing of the painting he questioned her if anything was going on and inferred through her reaction, and mine,  that something was indeed at large. That caught me off guard because the painting had been there over the holidays (while my father was away) and no one else had made a thing of it, yet, he had. 

I still said nothing (I couldn't look him in the eye, I felt ashamed) as he went on on how I must have been having a hard time dealing with all of this: constantly thinking about it and not sleeping. Then, he went on naming the fears I had: What my friendâ€™s would think of me, how it would affect my career, what I would end up looking like and if I would be accepted by my family. He then said, â€˜â€™you probably thought of going abroad to transition and then come back havenâ€™t you?â€™â€™. I smirked when he said that: I felt like he was reading my mind. 

He went on by saying that he didnâ€™t give a crap if I wanted to be a woman, and that all that mattered to him was that I was happy no matter the cost. He told me that he would always love me, and that heâ€™d walk every step of the way with me if that is what I wanted. He said that I could transition at home or, if I preferred, that he would assist me in moving out and doing so in my own private space.

I still said nothing, completely caught off guard. Honestly, I still was afraid of admitting to my father that I wanted to be a woman, but he took my silence as me agreeing to everything he said, which I did. 

Thatâ€™s when my mom chimed in: she told me that she would like me to see a therapist to answer any questions I had, and understand these feelings (even though I told her I knew what I felt and that I knew I was a woman). Thatâ€™s when I spoke and told her just that: â€˜â€™ Iâ€™ve told you many times, I have no doubts of what I feel, please stop doubting meâ€™â€™. She replied what she always has by saying that maybe I was wrong. My father then told her that SHE was wrong in acting this way: that she needed to come to terms with what I was saying. I wasnâ€™t looking for answers, I was searching for the path to get started in my transition. 

God, it felt so good to finally be understood.

My father then asked if it would be alright with me that heâ€™d research for a therapist in my stead so that I could begin, and left with my mom. I just sat there in my chair still looking at the wall: thatâ€™s when a smile covered my face for the first time in weeks.

I learned that you should never assume how people will react, that you should give them the chance to do so: you never know!!

I ignored them, and I told this middle aged lady that ""those bunch of girls are bullying me"" please note that I've been helping them out for quite a number of events so I know them pretty well! She told me to just ignore those kids because kids like this are stereotypically known as delinquents or people who don't study and are drop outs, causing troubles everywhere in my country. But I got so riled up. I did nothing! 

I couldn't deal with it and got emotional, I cried, I screamed and I left. Soon after I dropped an email to the sports organization asking for these girls to be terminated and banned from joining future events. Bullying shouldn't be condoned! 

I feel pretty distraught. I'm at home now and I think I just wanna rest and get over it :( ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Last Thursday I went to a regular meeting with my psychiatrist. I am going there to deal with my depression and the gender identity issues I have. I meant to have use it to help me deal with the depression whilst waiting for my referal for gender therapy to get resolved..

When searching for the referal I had to meet with two people. The psychiatrist I am currently having and a male doctor. To say the least that doctor was probably of the old guard and kept telling me how ""beautiful a boy"" I was and that I should find a relationship and have sex instead as me being a virgin apparently caused me to be insecure.  In essence he kept asking me why I was there and why I wanted to do things. I never knew how to reply to that and I still don't... He wanted me to stop being an introvert and that there was a ""happy boy"" beneath my cold exterior..

I have self-esteem issues to begin with and I am not sure in what I want except that gender therapy is the way forward. I think the insecurity showed here as he kept telling me this was irrevocable and that I should wait and think it over more but in the end told me they would send the referal.

When my therapist called in December about two - three months after initially meeting those two she told me they had sent my referal when I asked her. I agreed to meet with her for dealing with depression as a side thing and in general I felt that my existence got a bit more bearable as I would probably get it in march or something this year. Usually the waiting time is 6 months.

I was glad that I could maybe ""be a woman"" by 20 atleast.. Then I met her last thursday..... In the middle of our conversation she told me that they had not written it nor sent it yet and that the doctor I met had ASKED her to give me a time to meet.......

I did hold it back but I wanted to cry my eyes out there.. I got so fucking ANGRY at them and eh.. I kept on like nothing had happened and I have never liked being mad or scolding people so I just kept it locked in. I slowly noticed that I became more and more empty...

Walking from the meeting to the train station I passed a lake filled with ice. I had not really vented my frustrations in any way but the thought hit me of literally jumping into the lake hoping to die of the shock.... I lost my will to do anything... I know its ""just another 6 months of waiting"" but I had been living on the hope that I was getting closer to therapy those last months....

Getting home I was mad. I still held tears etc in but there was nothing left for me. My life essentially became meaningless... Probably I was stupid for putting so much onto that therapy.....

The therapist told me they would write the referal once the doctor came back which would earliest be next week... If I am sure that shitty doctor will probably stall it more because he has to ""protect my gender"" or some shit from faulty decisions.......

I made the maths friday night. 6 months more if sent next week putting my reply in june/july mid year... and then 1,5 years more wait for hormones...... I will be 21, maybe not so much more than 20 but I always felt shit for never being able to be a teenage girl and now I will be older than that.... and hormones will take years to fullfill the transition making me around 23 - 25 basically making any youth as a girl impossible....... I am losing my will to live in all honesty.... idk what to do anymore...

"So Im 5""8 tall, about 34 inches underbust, 35.4 inches bust (Pre hrt no boobs of course).

I used to think that my shoulders would be my biggest concern but recently I realize that my ribs will cause me more trouble... Maybe they are too big in size, maybe they are too outwards. And also because of this, I dont think my waist can get any much smaller, its already a little below my ribs so I guess Im just destined to be thick because of my rib cage....


So I wonder what your experience is with this? I know hrt wont make bones change, but maybe it can change the fat or muscles around the organs to some degrees? Ive seen people saying their rib measurement shrunk after HRT, but Im not really mascular so I dont know what to expect... And is there anything you can do other than corset training and surgery (im not considering doing these). Maybe yoga can help?


I think this might be the thing that can stop me from passing... Yes some women have big rib cages as well, but mine is honestly huge and bulky, and theres not much fat and muscles left around there ...  How can so many trans women have slim bone structures Im so jealous!",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I just got back from my doctor's office with a prescription for HRT! This was my first appointment, so I didn't expect it to have the prescription in hand today, but apparently she was satisfied with everything on my end and works fast!

Unfortunately, it will be at least a few more weeks before I can actually start. I'm planning on banking sperm, and I want to get that accomplished first so I don't have to stop later. I figure I've waited this long to start, 2 or 3 weeks is not going to hurt anything.

I'm on cloud 9 right now, honestly. I had them call me my new name and update my pronouns, and I was nervous about it, but it felt right and even now kind of natural. 

I'm also still kinda nervous about starting. I'm not out at work or to anyone besides close friends and family, so I'm curious how long it will be before people start noticing changes. 

I'm also worried about how my mom has been reacting lately. My family is all very supportive, but as the time for HRT has drawn nearer, my mom has been constantly asking the, ""And you're sure this is what you want?"" question which really bugs me. There was also something in her voice that suggested she is still really worried about me transitioning. When I came out a year ago, both my parents were verbally very supportive. They have maintained that verbal support ever since, but I can't help but feeling like they are saying the right things, even though they might not necessarily feel the right things. I know they are worried about my future, they are both classic grade A worriers. 

In the end I know they love me, and that they would never do anything to intentionally hurt me, so I think it will just take time for them to come fully around to the idea. After all, they knew me as their son for 30 years before I came out. That's a lot of assumption to overcome.

He's taking spirolactane and after his blood work he'll be stopping in order to create healthy sperm. Does anyone have any idea how long it might take someone to recover from those kind of hormones? Any advice?

"I know people say to avoid the comments, but sometimes they sneak up. 

So I was recently watching Awesome Games Done Quick, a weeklong video game speedrunning marathon for charity. one of the commentators is a transwoman, she's really nice and I follow her on twitch now (even if im always working when she streams it seems). Another trans speedrunner developed strategies for a game, and we'll get to that now;

It's after the event but I'm checking out the raw stream footage on youtube to watch playthroughs I missed due to work or sleep or general adulting. one of them was for the Wind Waker, a zelda game. And one of the players made mention about one of the tricks used to make speedruns was named after a speedrunner who afterwards transitioned to female, and there was a bunch of other comments made... and I didn't think much of that because sometimes when people don't know about how to deal with our lingo, they say the wrong things, and I get that.

The comments on that youtube video though. holy shit. Hoooly shit. 

I hate when I read shit like the stuff they were saying, I won't even repeat any of it. I reported them for hate speech but who knows if anything will be done about it. Anyways...

...pre all of this I was the kind of person who needed the validation of peers. I had none on my own, and in a lot of ways I still don't. It might seem ridiculous given that I'm a full adult (just recently entering my third decade of being a fleshy human thing) but comments like the ones I saw get to me.

They get to me hard, they get under my skin, and I start to wonder if I'm not just what they're saying i am; a dude in a dress, deluded, ""retarded"" (I hate that word), surrounding myself in an echo chamber of others who want to be deluded.

Im 30 friggin' years old. been on hrt for a year and a half next month. And youtube comments from people who are likely 14 and spend way too much time on 4chan are making me question myself. Sigh. lol

"Here is my understanding of the ""gender critical"" movement. Please correct my understanding if it is wrong.

They tend to claim that ""biology is central to female oppression"", and I mostly agree with that statement (prior to the administration of exogenous hormones, which isn't going to magically stop existing just because some angry radfems are complaining about ""men"" sittin' on tha toilet). 

I also agree that transition does not change biological (natural born) sex. I believe transition makes someone, for almost all purposes, FUNCTIONALLY a member of the opposite sex, but obviously not 100% biologically identical. 

This point is the only part I understand and agree with, which I realize that a lot of the members on this forum disagree with (based on a prior post I made when I was trying pretty hard to not give in to my desire to transition).

But I feel like the method of wishing for trans folk not to transition is doing the opposite of what they seem to be aiming for while perpetuating the fact that biological males are almost always larger/stronger than biological females. Oftentimes, as well, I see trans people (once transitioned ""enough"" and thus comfortable with themselves) more willing to go against gender norms of the gender they identify with (example...transmen wearing dresses, who would have never been caught dead in a dress prior to physically masculinizing to a point that they are still seen as male and can wear a dress without being misgendered anymore). 

Also, they ignore that the majority of people tend to exhibit behaviors/interests that align with their biological sex, thus showing that gender roles in some capacity have some sort of basis for existing. These roles are no longer QUITE as necessary as they may have been in the past but still hold value, I believe. I'd not be caught dead saying that if I weren't able to transition, but men are more physically capable of doing physical type work, which is fully necessary for keeping society moving. Also, I, as someone who has resisted transition but am finally coming to terms after seeing a gender therapist for a while, would like to be one of those guys doing manual labor. I'm strong ""for my sex"", but almost every institution with co-ed labor/physical exertion recognizes the huge discrepancies, lowering standards for women to get in the armed forces, for example (to ridiculously low expectations, I would absolutely say).

Anyway, getting sort of jumbled. TL;DR:

1. Rad fem/gender critical ideology wishes to ""dismantle"" gender roles while simultaneously recognizing biological inequalities and wishing for people to not change these, even though malleable biology may accomplish (to an extent) exactly what radical feminism seems to want.

2. I think aspects of gender roles have a very necessary purpose for society to function, and we need both EQUALLY in order to avoid societal collapse.

3. What do you all think? I don't have the greatest understanding of radfem, but I think the ideology fails to recognize that certain aspects of the very gender roles they wish to abolish have a very real, functional purpose for societal maintenance. ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Hello,
I went to my second LHR appointment today. 1st was 5 weeks ago.

After the first, I had small results on my face and chest, and pretty good ones one my arms where a stronger laser  intensity was used. 

The technician increased the power this time. We did entire body. Didn't use very much more stronger intensity for face, but it was wayyy more painful than the 1st time. However, I have no redness or puffing, which is good for going back to work on Monday.

However now, although she said it's normal and there could be scabbing, I have these red spots all over my belly and arms, and actually a few small blisters on my hands.

My skin is very light, and my hair is dark, and I never ever go to tanning places or in the Sun, so she said I have the perfect skin for that.

Are these red spots all really going to disappear or has anyone had bad experience? It's really frightening!! Anything I should do to help? I don't want an entire body covered in red spots forever :_(

Thanks

Warning for probably super transphobic language, I'm sorry...

I feel like life is pretty much pointless because I can never be a ""real boy"". I know that one day (with a lot of time, money, and suffering) I can pass, but it doesnt feel like enough for me. I dont want chest scars. I want a penis; i dont want to have to love someone with a plastic toy, it just seems kinda. dirty.

my dysphoria is awful and i end almost every day with a full scale breakdown, self hate, self harm, crying myself to sleep, refusing to take my binder off, etc.

I feel like I'm betraying the trans community because of this, but i dont know what to do... 

i also feel like im fetishizing gay men, especially because before i was fully aware I was trans, I was one of those tweenage ""yaoi"" shippers, and my liking of gay content hasnt waned any. Whenever I read that kinda stuff I always imagine myself as one of the characters, even when i was younger. I guess this is a differrent kind of deal than what the rest of this post is about though so ill stop it with the fact that ive only ever imagined myself in relationships with other guys as a guy myself

"M 28 here. I didn't know anything about Pure-O but after researching it makes total sense. I always thought it sounded like crap but researching it I really think I may have it. Lately my intrusive thought is: what if I'm trans? I look in the mirror and think I would be an attractive woman and I smile. I don't smile at my body. Ever. I feel sexy when I imagine myself as a woman, but it's hard for me to visualize. Is this just an intrusive thought? Am I actually trans and had no idea? I don't know anymore. It seems people with Pure-O on here thinking they are trans isn't uncommon. My girlfriend has been very supportive of me with my depression, bi polar and kinks but I think this may be too much for her. We are both very liberal but after all she is straight. I desperately want to shave my beard and try make up but she loves my beard and will know something is up. Should I be honest with her and tell her my feelings? I love her but I also financially can't lose her right now. If she left me I'd be forced to move back in with my parents and they wouldn't let me try and discover who I possibly am. I really don't know if this is real or just the Pure-O making me feel this way. Looking back I tried cross dressing and wearing women's clothes multiple times as a child and teen, even painting my face up to look like a girl. I even tried tucking many times in my teens but I think I'd want to keep my penis. Is that normal? I have so many questions. I like men's clothes, ambivalent is more the word, but I was always jealous of women and the fashion they can wear. Jealousy really is the word. I've always been jealous of women: their hair, clothes, makeup, but especially their sexuality. Also very jealous of lesbian sexuality. Maybe I'm a trans lesbian? Maybe I'm straight but super kinky? How does somebody know if they just like cross dressing or are actually transgender? When I think of myself as a girl I'm no longer a shy, depressed male, but a happy, sexual, confident and cute girl. Something about wanting to be a woman makes sense to me.

"Hey everyone - 

I'm coming up on four months of HRT, just switched to injections a few weeks ago. I understand all forms of estrogen and testosterone therapy bear some risks, but everything is compounding at this time. During my initial 'high' after starting hormones I decided to upgrade all of my courses so I can go to a good university. I had a pretty limited timeline, but figured I could do it, and its been brutal, but I'm almost done, and will probably be able to go anywhere in Canada for my program. This has been super stressful all around. On top of that, I'm not out to my friends, and my plan to not tell anyone and go full time when I begin school likely wont work - things are changing too damn fast which brings a ton of issues forwards alarmingly fast. 

I have all of this stress constantly, and I feel it manifests itself in serious, relatively constant anxiety that I'm going to drop dead at any moment. Headaches, sore muscles, strained eyes from staring at a computer, etc all = im going to die without ever living the life I'm working so hard and am so close to having. 

What's worse is that it has become cyclical - stressed out about school and life turns into acute health anxiety which disables me from getting any school work done, which makes it all worse the next time. 

I know the risks are low, and I have copies of a vast number of tests which all state I'm in good health, I run an hour every day, quit drinking heavily and smoking pot, began cooking all my own meals all to try and relieve this, but it is becoming too much. I know significantly more about the human body and biology than most individuals, and I have a wicked memory that means i can remember nearly every symptoms I have ever read about for a great number of heal issues. But alas, I am not a doctor, and so I cannot differentiate between what I should or shouldn't worry about. I can't go the doctor each week for whatever is on my mind, so I'm stuck dealing with it and slowly breaking down.

Does anyone with a similar experience have any advice for how they dealt with it? I understand a comprehensive therapy programs will not be delivered by internet strangers, but the route which you may have taken to tackle these issues would be great.

"So I was high af earlier and I had a genius idea.

I found something that could potentially be used as a STP and a realistic packer all at once. 

I was looking at /r/ents and saw someone talking about synthetic urine, so I googled that and found a site talking about a product called the Whizzinator Touch. It's meant to allow men to have a discreet way to deliver synthetic urine during a supervised drug test, activated by a switch and squeezing the ""head"". 

Now, alone, it's an awkward looking packer that only lets you pretend to pee. However, if someone were to find out how to integrate a catheter (with a one way valve so urine wouldn't flow back into the bladder) that fed into a pouch and then attach the apparatus to a harness that could hold the pouch high up between the thighs so you could flex/squeeze them together as you squeeze the head in order to get the flow going.

"After lurking for a million years and occasionally commenting on people's lovely posts...well, I finally have an actual question for asktransgender. 

I'm very lucky and have an insurance (Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois) that purportedly covers 100% of any transition-related surgery...but my medical group won't tell me which surgeons are in my network. I've been trying since October to get top and bottom surgery, and since I've been on hormones for over 10 years (I'm intersex, but not well documented enough that it matters *in this case of surgery*) I figured it would be...relatively easy? Not 'it will happen in a week' easy but 'it will happen in 6 months to 2 years' easy. So far it's looking like I was still too optimistic. 

When I call my insurance, they say to call my group for providers in my network. I called my group and they literally just asked me if I'd 'pursued therapy, because that is also effective for treating gender dysphoria'. My doctors at Howard Brown in Chicago are great but haven't been able to get answers from my insurance either. I have several letters and all for any kind of WPATH clearance. I've just had no luck finding providers based on what my insurance will (won't) tell me. The few times the *insurance navigation team* at Howard Brown have come through with referrals for me, 5/6 times they haven't even lead to a consult, because the doctors didn't perform the surgeries I want as the team got told by my insurance. One provider wasn't even sure why he was mentioned because he only does FFS, which to our knowledge isn't covered by ANY medical group.

Has anyone else gone through this and come out with referrals/consults/surgery? I remember once seeing that there was a service that helped trans people with the next step in their transiton, but I'm not sure if that included working with their insurance and medical group to get answers about providers. I also believe it might have been Mytranshealth which is very vague in my situation, since all it will tell me is that Howard Brown has trans friendly providers in my area (I know!). 

I'm at the end of my rope her, so if anyone here knows anything let me know. Feel free to pm if you don't want to share more private(?) details with the class. I'm just as likely to get answers here as I am from both my insurance and one of the best informed consent clinics in the US at this point. ",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I'm in such a depressed mood I don't know what to do with myself right now. I don't know if I'm over emotional or what but I was on the verge of presenting at work before things went array.

Today was the day all supervisors were notified of myself being transgender and what I thought would be then letting everyone else know before they see me again. However, apparently HR mistook my intentions and thought that the time off I requested to visit my parents was my final step before coming out at work. This visit isn't until the end of the month and I was told they would be ""more comfortable"" following what they understood the plan was.

After telling them it was fine I hung up the phone and just cried. I was so excited to finally be me 100% of the time now and not just outside of work living a double life. I'd already put away all my male work clothes in a bag to donate this week and I can't bring myself to unpack it for another month, I've waited so long and I thought this was finally it.

Is it too much of me to call tomorrow and ask to go ahead and begin presenting my next shift? I don't know how I am going to survive this month when I thought everything was finally going to change? Am I out of line to ask this because they are not comfortable yet? I don't know if I should or not and I'm afraid of being too demanding by asking so much from them.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

While it was a bit flawed today, it was a lot more successful today in applying. (bit too much blush, bit of mistakes on the eyes, they are hard with the bad lighting here)

I put on a new years hat (while cowgirl hat with pinks dots), and to be honest i looked a lot more feminine than what i usually see in the mirror. A major success even though there was a bit of failure.

Also at midnight me and my wife went outside while i was in full makeup, clothes and heals and interacted with a few people, was a bit hard, and i think i got clocked to some extent, but I did it.

"Throwaway account for privacy reasons. I know it's another typical post however I feel I need advice.

I've always felt less masculine than other boys. Not ""feminine"", per se, but I've never really wanted to play sports, or do those sorts of activities. I've been drawn to other things (stereotypically feminine things). I never felt uncomfortable in my body, but I didn't really feel comfortable either. I also didn't fit in that well with other boys, and I felt pushed away. Around age 11(?) I began to make attempts at becoming more ""masculine"" however I quickly discovered that wasn't something I wanted to do, nor did I like doing it. 

Around that same age I began to develop mild OCD and anxiety issues, which I still struggle with nowadays. Within a year or so I also got depression; I felt like other guys didn't like me or want to be around me. To me, there was something wrong with me (myself). It got to the point where I felt like I was so unliked that I didn't want to leave the house. I wanted to stay inside and be alone.

I didn't really feel like myself. I felt I was doing something wrong, that there was something wrong with me. And I did question a few times, ""Am I even a guy?"" and other questions like ""Why am I like this?"". At this point I hadn't heard of this community.

By chance, I discovered this community and I've been trying to find similar situations to mine. It was pure luck that I found this sub (although I previously - and still do - identified as Bi, I had never thought of myself as transgender). As I read other people's experiences,  I felt less alone. I genuinely felt like this was why I've always felt so different from other boys. I know this whole post probably sounds like a ramble but as I look back on previous experiences it makes perfect sense.

I felt like I wasn't wrong. I wasn't strange. There wasn't something wrong with me.

While I haven't ever identified as a female, I feel more... confident now? I don't feel so alone. I said it out loud to myself in the mirror and I suddenly felt more happy. I haven't really been in a good place recently and as I write this my hands are shaking. I haven't felt confident or happy with myself at all - but when I did say it, and hear it coming from my own mouth, it made me feel happy.

The past makes sense to me now. I thought that me not being ""masculine"" enough was an issue with me. But it's not an issue at all. I still don't feel happy in my own skin, however, and I'm asking for help on what to do next (coming out, HRT, etc. I still haven't come out as Bi to anyone, except my closest friend).

I am incredibly closeted about my Dysphoria (Hints the new account), so I have nothing but respect and admiration for all of you who are blazing the path for us- and hopefully I will be able to truly join your ranks. One question, what is the typical end goal of the MtF transformation? Like I would love to go down this journey, will I always have to consider myself a trans-woman? Do some of you all go through your new lives and not tell anyone your secret? I am from the deep south with incredibly conservative parents and I cannot imagine starting my transformation in this area. So basically have any of you all gotten to the point where you can have intimate relationships with people and they would be none the wiser of your transformation? Can I turn a new page and live a completely different life? Or is that breaking some Cardinal rule? Which if it is the please let me know. I know this journey is not the safest nor the easiest, so I want to know as much as I can before I dive into this! Happy New Year!

"I have been on pills for about 1.5.  My current dose 6mg estrodial and 100spiro.

I went it for a check up see how my estrogen levels are and also how low my test was.  He came in greeted me and told me i looked beautiful and the changes are looking great on me. I was flattered but I had questions for him. I wanted to switch from pills to injections. Reasons why i wanted to switch cause i felt i might see more results. My friends told me that is was way better for them. But I also understand that our body has to absorb the hormone so the changes can be made. He told me that he wanted me to stay on pills cause it is for safer for me. He was telling me about the risk for injections which quite scared me. ( the on site shot, risk of wasting the injection, the pain, and i might not see changes at all)

But in october before that increased  from 2mg- 4mg. but in december i went from 4mg-6mg.  He told me that is very quick and he wanted to try out the 6mg for a few months and then we can talk more about it. He told me i could be on the highest estrogen and get no changes or my changes could be slowed down cause it is too high. is that true?.

Then he started reading my levels that is when i started smiling. Estrogen levels are really high from the first time was 20-92-140-190-208- 236. 236 is high. He told im about as high as comes when women are menstruating. My test is 0. I am happy for that. Are my estrogen levels too high??

The changes i seen over the year
1) i have a hourglass body shape
2) my skin is soft
3) face is a lot more round
4) Breast growth
5) my shoe size went down 2 sizes im a 8 in womens now
6) my hair is thin
7) i have had an ass but my ass is alot bigger and more round and plump
8) my hair does not grow as quickly
9) voice my is higher. I have always had a high voice  or a female voice. but it sounds like im seducing people idk  how i feel.
10)I am a lot more bitcher and more in touch with life 
11) i crave pickles and salty foods alot more
12) taste buds
13) how I see life and how i think and act. 
14) physical changes are there. I pass quite well

But I am sad that i can't be on injections.  am i greedy for wanting more and more changes? Should i be thankful. 
I started transitioning at 22. Everywhere i go i get ma'am and smiles from men. But i feel like i want more. i do not want seem selfish. My downstairs does not even work thank god.

I ask if my health insurance will laser hair removal. He told me to ask my insurance. I have health net.

If i can get help or guidance that would be nice. I am sorry for ranting and jumping around. If you read this and reply thank you for your time.

"I've watched quite a few transition timeline videos and the girls turn out so good that I obviously hope that it will be the same for me but I have seen alot hairline, chin, jaw and cheek changes and I just feel bones at my chin and jaw. My cheekbones would have to grow and wouldn't be able to get to that point with just fat. My hairline is really bad and masculine but I have seen a few where their hairline got fixed and got the feminine shape, will HRT do that? Or do actually so many people undergo facial surgery or why are their chins, jaw etc. so goddamn feminine and pretty?

I really hate my life because I start to think that every trans my age (16) has better conditions to turn out pretty, curvy and petitie. They are often as small as their sisters and are much smaller than most men, for me it is completely the opposite.

"For me, all of this really started when I was around 16 and got dumped. Before that, i was Cisgendered and hetero.

After that, i began to find myself to drawn to being Bi.

Around 2 years after that, i now come to question my gender identity.

Is there anything scientific I can read to see if I identify with anything? 

I've had chest fat for quite some time, and have been teased about it *a lot* for almost 4 years, since before I began to even realise or think I could be bisexual. Could this be it?

I remember being quite excited years before I even noticed what I looked like under my shirt around the age of 12-13, that there was a surgeon who had a world record for the largest number of male to female and female to male gender reassignment surgeries. I teased some of my friends with it, i joked how I'd get it done, and stuff like that.

I asked about what would happen to an MTF person's Y-chromosome after changing genders (I only recently found that transitioning is done through hormones prior to surgery) and stuff like that.

I think I found the concept quite engaging for quite some time, but then I don't want to end up messing around and taking a stupid risk, i do not know if I experience gender dysphoria as such, i read that article ""8 signs of gender dysphoria"" as well, but can't seem to identify with it too much. I mean, my parents were a lot more restrictive than most of my peers, so I guess I *would* feel different. Come to think of it, i'm comfortable with my genitals but then I have a lot of discomfort about body fat and often my appearance, and my mind's eye has this image of me as these variety of females i know of ""The girl that dumped me, or Julia Roberts, or something like that. 

I find I now remember fantasising about waking up with bodies exchanged with the girl, and living like that for a while. 

On the other hand my behaviour is masculine but I'm horrible at sports and find them uninteresting and also I remember this one incident where we were rocking climbing.

All my classmates did it, fat or tall or short, but I was the only one that didn't. All this also makes me question my masculinity.

However my tastes are masculine, i like video games or guns and tanks and things.

My genetics won't allow me to get to cis girl standards since there are just narrow hips in my family and height shrinkage isn't really a thing atleast it wouldn't be enough. My hairline is nothing near feminine and so are my shoulders which won't lose much width, I don't have any muscles so any shrinkage in width would be barely noticeable.

I had a great catch up with my aunt over the holiday break and was helping her find some trans groups or groups that would be trans friendly in her area of Bennington, Vermont. She isn't the best with tech so I told her I ask around on Reddit. 

She is in her late 60s and started transitioning/came out about 10 years ago. She said she was primarily looking to get out and make friends trans or otherwise. Overall just groups that open to all and aren't closed minded to her being trans. She is very much into the outdoors/hiking/adventuring/survival type. Think old school national geographic. I think she also completed her master gardener license recently. She also said that she prefer groups that went out and did fun things rather than just going to a bar. I  imagine she also prefer a more mature group in terms of age. She is willing to travel an hour or maybe two as well.

She used to do the Green Mountain Club https://www.meetup.com/gmcbennington/ so I passed their phone number over to her.

A very dear friend of mine lives in Tennessee (a very conservative part of the US) and has horribly strict parents.

I want her to be as happy as she can be while also being safe, so I intend to ship her a few in a non-descriptive box so she can try it. 

She has not done very much research on shopping for binders yet, and after a few hours of looking around online, I'm still confused on which ones would work well because there is so much difference of opinion.

I do remember one occasion, I was walking around the house shirtless and I was only in some underpants I think and then I went to answer the door and I wrapped a towel around my top and bottom half and I remember someone said to me ""what are you doing, your a man aren't you"".

"Hi all, I'm a trans girl (~2 years hrt) and am using a throwaway account because I'm slightly shy about admitting this, but I've been pretty active here for around 4 years. 

Anyways, I started visiting asktg a few months before I came out to myself as trans. A really major component of my decision to start transitioning was the threads about people experiencing changes in their sexual orientation while transitioning. I would search for these often and in depth. And I would always keep an eye out for new ones. I still do this, though with less of the fervor than before, probably because hrt has toned down my libido.

It wasn't exactly that I wanted to undergo a change in my orientation myself (though that might have been a bit of it too). Rather, I simply thought the descriptions of trans girls slowly recognizing their attractions to guys were just really hot. Especially when they would write about first catching themselves staring at a guy, or smelling one, or imagining kissing one. Their naivetÃ© and first cautious steps toward a life of being into men really kept me coming back.

I'm so grateful for these threads. Without I'm not sure I would have figured my own gender stuff out as early as I did. I admit I used them as masturbation material (and still do), but I surely can be the only one, right? Who else appreciates these threads the way I do",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"I have certainly never felt mentally handicapped or ill.  In fact, it has been quite the opposite.  In my youth my teachers told my parents that, 'His grades might not be as high because he's not just seeing the white and black - he is seeing all the grey around the question.""  
  
That statement has defined my life, and led to numerous academic and professional successes, despite a lifetime of dysphoria.  
  
I qualified for many scholarships through test scores, but left the annoying and rigid environment of college early to start work.  In my career I rose through the ranks quickly because I saw what needed to be done, apart from all the other bullshit, and I did it.  What befuddled others seemed so clear and simple to me.  When I decided I wanted to get wealthy, I initially hit a lot of stumbling blocks because the world of finance is filled with lots of ego and do's/dont's.  It took some years, but using this juicy 'ol transgendered brain I was able to see money and speculation in an abstract way that some others apparently couldn't.  Hence I became financially independent.  
  
Only recently have I allowed myself to face a lifetime of dysphoria and anguish about my gender.  I won't lie that this wasn't pleasant and it brought a lot of grief and pain to my life.  Being dysphoric and born to the wrong sex (according to how I feel) certainly doesn't seem like a blessing at first glance.  But it has allowed me to understand people and the abstract systems they draw between them in novel ways.  
  
I am successful and who I am, likely in no small part due to the transgender nature of my brain.  
  
I vehemently deny the idea that being transgender or even dysphoric is a 'mental illness'.  I'm not implying every transgender person is by causation mentally gifted, but I am confident that our brains are able to do things and see things that cis brains cannot.  It is sad that we have been made to feel that we are somehow degenerates or lessers to our cis equivalents.  
  
Be proud that you were born transgender.  You might not have wanted these gifts, but you got them.  Might as well embrace all the ways that your brain excels in ways others might not.  
  
You aren't just valid.  You are *exceptional.*

*Edit, Because multiple people in the comments are saying that because being trans makes you less likely to have babies it can't be an evolutionary advantage.**  
  
Here is what you are missing.  We haven't been in an organism vs organism environment for millennia now.  The individual genetics of a single human don't really contribute that much to his/her/they success - not nearly as much as the society he/she/they lives in.  
  
Once writing became ubiquitous, the world became a clashing Petri dish of civilization vs civilization.  We humans became the cells of a much larger super organism, and it wasn't Grog vs Grog but Babylonians vs Assyrians and etc.  
  
The civilizations that evolved the fastest consumed and dominated those that didn't.  So it has been until present day.  
  
Trans people are very specialized and powerful cells in the civilizations that support them.  The prevalence of trans people in Silicon Valley should be somewhat of a hint of that.  **You don't have to directly sire offspring or have 400 babies to be a massive evolutionary boon.**  
  
The society that you're a part of benefits from how amazing you are, because we are interconnected in a larger system now.  ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"First I would just like to make a disclaimer, I try to be completely neutral on this. I am not a member of any party. I do not have any specific agenda for this, it is just a topic I became interested in (not politically, but scientifically). I am not coming at it from any specific angle and I would like to know all the facts. If you disagree with something I would genuinely appreciate your opinion on it. You must have logic for your disagreement so if you could put it into words I will consider your opinion unbiasedly.  (sorry, I might have also phrased some things in a way that seem skeptical of transgender people)

Your genes act as instructions for your body to follow while developing. Hormones are sent out to carry out these instructions. Sometimes non genetic factors can get in the way of developing. (For example a person who has a partially grown leg was probably not caused by genetics, but an issue that prevented the body from fully completing the genetic instructions.) There can be a lot of natural variety in biology and nature and everything basically. When you are developing into either a male or female your body has to go through a set of steps to get to that point. The normal path of development for a male would be starting off with XY sex chromosomes, with a Y chromosome containing a typical male SRY gene. Testes would develop, releasing androgens (testosterone and other male hormones) would prevent the baby from becoming female and from there the primary sexual characteristics (genitals, amounts grey-white matter, and even dumb things like the length of your pointer and ring fingers) and the secondary sexual characteristics as well (what happens during puberty) would be primarily male. 

But, like anything, ANYTHING can go wrong ANYWHERE along that line and it actually far more common than you probably would think. Starting from the beginning, some people donâ€™t have either XX or XY sex chromosomes, some people have XXXXY, XXXYY, XO, XXX, half of cells have an XY chromosome while the other has XX, sometimes someone has XY chromosomes with no SRY gene so it basically just functions as a XX sex chromosome, as well as many more possible combinations. Next someone can develop ovotestes, sometime for no apparent reason. Finally, some people have a hormonal imbalance that will prevent the primary sex characteristics from forming, which will affect the secondary sex characteristics as well. Basically, the hormones are what almost completely what makes you into a male or a female, beyond that, your chromosomes are just an extremely small microscopic thing inside the nucleus of your cells, you (yes you) might never know your actual sex chromosome pair without getting it tested and youâ€™ll otherwise still just be completely the way you are. Sex hormone imbalance (or complete switch) can be caused by external environmental conditions, or biological conditions such as Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome where the body cannot respond to androgens in a person with XY chromosomes. In Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome the body could be masculinized completely ambiguously (yes that includes the genitals). In the cases of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia when there are mutations in the CYP21A2 gene which causes a 21-hydroxylase deficiency, there is a cortisol deficiency which causes a hyperplasia in androgen producing cells in the adrenal cortex of the adrenal glands. This causes an increase in the amount of androgens being produced, this will only simply increase the amount of androgens in an otherwise normal XY male, and in a XX-sex chromosomed individual it will create a sex hormone imbalance, sometimes even so far over on the spectrum that it will create a complete male. Another interesting condition in sex hormone imbalances is a 5-Alpha-Reductase Deficiency. In 5ARD it will prevent the body from responding to dihydrotestosterones, which is essential in the development of the external male genitalia. People born this way will be born looking completely female, but at puberty with the release of testosterone it develop more and look more male. 

Interestingly these people with 5ARD almost always â€œfeelâ€ male since a very young age. People with Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome ALWAYS â€œfeelâ€ female. People with Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome often times donâ€™t really care which way they â€œfeelâ€. Studies have been done on people with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasiaâ€™s â€œgender identityâ€ and the more extreme the symptoms, virilization, and the male hormone levels are, the more likely it is that that person will â€œfeelâ€ male. Interestingly, females with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, definitely seem to have a 30% chance at being a â€œlesbianâ€. A commonly cited example that gender identity is NOT a social construct is; in the 1960â€™s two regular twin boys were born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In an accident one of them was injured in a way that the parents were told â€œhe could never be maleâ€. John Money, a Psychologist from New Zealand, who worked at John Hopkins University already had a theory that gender binary behaviours were caused by how the child was brought up, and not by biology, which was the generally accepted Idea at the time. He used this situation as an experiment to prove to the world that his theory was in fact correct. The child was never told about the surgery that occurred at infancy but was relentlessly convinced that he was a boy, not a girl. John Moneys reports on the experiment suggested that it was a success, even though he was entirely aware of the way he felt. Eventually both twins committed suicide. Since then, with technological advancements, scientists were able to study the brain and how sexual dimorphism in behaviour is linked to neurology. Scientists now know that the Hypothalamic Uncinate Nucleus is an essential part in this, and is a primary sex characteristic. 

What about ""transgenderâ€ people? Could the transgenders' â€œgender identityâ€ even possibly be related to the intersex peopleâ€™s gender identity, or the thousands of regular males and females throughout history who have, for whatever reason, been brought up and the opposite gender? Scientists have been wondering about transgender peopleâ€™s brains so many studies have been done on it. In one study, transgender peoples' hypothalamus were examined and all to date have matched up with the gender they believed themselves to be, whether or not they have taken hormones. An image of a transgender hypothalamic uncinate nucleus (bottom right): https://s28.postimg.org/vuy43dsd9/ygoygy.png Note that the reference male and the homosexual male are the same, this part of the brain seemingly has nothing to do with sexual orientation. Another study involved giving rats hormones during pregnancy. The rats who were given hormones in the first half had an ambiguous genitals but when their dimorphic behaviour was measured, it correctly matched their chromosome pair (the ""suggestion"" of their natural development). The rats who were given hormones during the second half of pregnancy had a reproductive system that matched their chromosome pair but their measured behaviour was ""unmatched"" and was that opposite of their sex chromosome pair. I guess you could say, some animals could be ""transgender"". In general, so far the most compelling, seemingly truthful, and unbiased scientific information definitely seems to point to â€œat the very least, the great majority of transgender people have neurological differences constant with their gender identity and it is seemingly a natal condition as wellâ€.

What about the rare transgender people who have â€œuntransitionedâ€? Well think about this, Can't people choose to be transgender, to be part of a group?  I have seen a one or two transgender people who absolutely clearly seem to just be â€œdoing something funâ€ and look at it just like getting a tattoo. Is this a wrong thing to do? I couldnâ€™t really tell you that. A large part of what is right or wrong is defined by society. For example, with plastic surgery, is this a wrong thing do if you grew up in a family and society that looked at cosmetic plastic surgery as perfectly normal and acceptable? In a world where gender has hardly any meaning would anyone changing genders even be questioned? I honestly have no opinion, but most likely anyone who wants to change genders would feel a little out of place because they are going against their biology. Another possible, but controversial example is autogynephilia, to the extreme point of when someone transitions genders full time. Although this topic is somewhat unstudied. I would be interested in knowing more in detail why sexual orientation in considered to be an essential part of this, and what that idea was originally is based off of. I don't believe this is a topic anyone should be obsessing over, and you should not try to keep it in your mind too much when meeting new people. Transgender people usually socially transition at a young age but some transition older. This doesnt necessarily say anything about a person's brain. Although someoneâ€™s Hypothalamus may remain slightly more on a binary side of masculinization since birth, some people may be able to â€œput up with itâ€ longer due to a less extreme ""identification"" you could say. Gender itself does not seem to be a social construct, but it can have many socially constructed roles and stereotypes as a part of it. Our brains are not designed to think that we are a certain species, race, or object. These things are not really comparable to transgender people.

As for the bathroom debate, it seems very unlikely that transgender people themselves would harass or harm anyone else in their preferred bathroom. A more pressing argument is regular people may dress up as the opposite gender to try to pass as ""transgender"". Although, there have been none or few cases of this happening other than people trying to make a political point. An argument that can support allowing transgender people in their chosen bathroom is the majority of transgender people look quite average as their gender and have already been using their preferred bathroom, also a significant percentage of people who don't look ""normal"" as their gender may not even be considered ""transgender"". Many people have been raised consistently since birth as one gender, and have congruent genital appearance, and neurology, but had a hormonal imbalance during puberty due to an intersex condition but was unable to acquire (or did not want) any treatment for it. Meaning that for example, a person who appears as a female dressing as a male may been born almost completely biologically male and not be transgender. To completely ban all people who fit into the decided category of transgender may not be a very logical decision, many people who consider themselves transgender have had very complicated stories of intersex conditions and surgery as an infant. But to ban people who appear physically as the opposite gender (which is not always transgender) may be a possibility to think about for safety, but we should be carefully considered the positive and negative aspects of it, I personally don't agree with doing that. Either way, options like having multiple small bathrooms or gender neutral bathrooms can often times save money and space, and could be a possible goal for the future of bathrooms.

"I finally had the courage to go get my junk checked. But mainly I wanted to ask a doctor if I could do something to stop my periods since the give me dysphoria.

The gynecologist, an old woman, asked me about the psychiatric pills I'm taking. I should've known something was wrong when she said my medication was ""holding me back"" from having a good life and you can get over depression by being happy. No shit.

Nevermind that, I told her I didn't want to menstruate anymore. It made me feel awful, and since I will never have kids I didn't see the purpose.

""As a doctor, and especially as a woman, I don't agree with you. It's just not natural."" she said.

I didn't take that well, at all. I already have my parents to tell me being gay isn't natural either. ""But even if you don't agree, can I do it anyway?""

""Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it. It will harm your body because you stop a natural process, and you'll have to take hormones for the rest of your life. Is that better than to put up with this small problem once a month?""

I kid you not, we talked like 10 minutes. I was trying to convince her but she kept telling me she didn't agree with it.

""Look, I want to get a hysterectomy someday. I just want to stop the periods until that happens."" I said.

""Why do you hate your womanhood so much? You have to be comfortable with your own biology.""

""Well, the thing is that I'm transgender, that's why I'm not comfortable with it."" I didn't want to tell her I'm trans but oh well. I just didn't know what to do so that she would give me the option to stop my fucking periods.

""It doesn't matter. I have a lot of patients like that. Many girls are like you, but they're comfortable with their own sexuality. Your parents know you like girls?""

At that point I though *you don't know what transgender is, do you.* I basically pretended to agree with everything she said, had my junk checked and got out of there. I was really upset.

Then my mom thought it was a great idea to inform me, after I've already come out of there, that the gynecologist was a very religious woman that made trips to India to study ""natural remedies"" or some shit like that. Why didn't she tell me beforehand??

1: the word pussy typically refers to a vagina, but are there any trans women who use it anyways?

"Ok so I started questioning my gender about 3ish months ago, right after my freshmen year homecoming. As a kid, I didn't care who or what I played with, thought I did tend to have slightly more male friends and boys toys. I was never really thought about my gender up until I was about 10. That's when I started puberty and my body started to develop. At around 9, I gained a lot of weight. I was so uncomfortable with my body, but I just chalked it up to my weight, though I hadn't felt even an ounce of discomfort about it until almost a year later, despite me being bullied about it.

At 11, I started to lose weight. I wanted my breasts to disappear, I wanted to grow a lot taller, and I wanted my body to be straight, not curvy. I developed an eating disorder (that I have since overcome). During this time, I strictly wore oversized sweatshirts, boys basketball shorts, and sneakers. 

Over the next three years, I was always so self conscious and never comfortable. I had felt off since I was about 10, but it only intensified as I got older. I started dressing and acting more girly to try and fit in with my piers, but I knew that I was different. I would often sit in my room, crying, asking a god that I don't believe in why he had to make me a freak.

Fast forward to this year. I'm 15 and a freshman in highschool. The summer before starting school, I cut my hair shoulder length. I wanted to cut it shorter (and had for years, but didn't because I wanted to be a normal girl), but I was too scared to because I did this in my room with a pair of kids craft scissors. Anyways, about a week into October, I cut my hair even shorter into a boyish style. Not exactly a pixie cut, but boyish. Whenever I looked into the mirror after I did this, I saw myself as a boy. I was so confused, but I really loved how I looked.

In the months since, I have questioned my gender and have changed my style to match that of a male. I like myself so much better and I realized that that ""off"" feeling goes away the more I present as male. I realized that the hate I have felt for myself and my body is actually dysphoria. The only thing that I struggle with now is justifying my feelings. I feel like since I didn't actually start actively questioning my gender until late 2016 that I'm just making everything up. 

Some days, I feel like I am male, like I was always meant to be male. Other days, I wake up as yell at myself saying ""You're a girl! You've always been a girl and you always will be!"" The longer I've been questioning, the more I've been coming to terms with everything. 

Though I feel more comfortable in my own skin since I've started presenting as male, I feel like I'm not valid because I didn't start questioning until late 2016.

"I'm MTF, and my birth name is Elliot.


I've never liked the name Elliot (I remember saying that when I was 5) never quite knew why, but now I hate it because it's masculine (I wonder if that was why I hated it, I just didn't understand).


Anyway, I have been thinking about Ellie, like **Elli**ot and I've always liked that name, but now I'm having second thoughts.


I also like the name ""Lauren"" a lot more than Ellie. There is something about that name I just love. But I know 2 Lauren's, and it might make it awkward if I decide to use that name. I know them, but I don't speak to them, they are someone in my year at school.



I'm thinking of saying that was going to be my name if I were AFAB (it wasn't) but just so it isn't that awkward.

"Hey everyone, I've been on HRT for almost 1 year &amp; 10 months, about 4mg estrogen gel/day, and a few months ago I moved down to 5mg Cyproterone Acetate per day.

I'm not a sexually active person, maybe having an orgasm once every 6-8 weeks. Well, I orgasmed a couple of times this week, even twice a couple of days (5 times in 3 days), and each time I orgasmed, a rather cloudy, thick, sticky fluid came out.

Now, a few months after starting HRT (starting at 20mg Cypro), I stopped ejaculating, and if I did it was clear, and not sticky.

So I'm wondering if there's sperm in my ejaculate now, given the rather low-dose AA. Has anyone else had this experience?

"Throwaway, just in case. I realize this likely isn't a common experience, but I'm curious if anyone else's gone through the same thing.

Before transition, I'd always had a tendency to introject. This behavior's been present for as long as I can remember. It's always existed alongside the dysphoria I've had since early childhood. 

For those unfamiliar with what introjection is, it's a symptom of dissociation. When I'd introject, I'd take on attributes, even entire identities, of fictional characters. To cope with episodes of severe dysphoria, I'd internally ""become"" someone else... adopting the roles, personalities and mannerisms of characters. I'd get so consumed by the dissociation that my entire self-perception would change. I'd physically perceive myself as the character to the point that I wouldn't recognize myself in the mirror.  

It's been almost a year since starting HRT, and one of the most surprising things I've discovered is that I can no longer introject. My ability to dissociate is just... gone. I get stressed and my immediate urge is to retreat into one of my dozens of false constructed identities... and it doesn't work. It's like the ability to access that part of my consciousness completely disappeared. Transition has, for the first time, forced me to inhabit my actual body and my actual identity.

One thing that's been happening a bit the past few months is random strangers just going ""oh you're so pretty!"" and my mind immediately thinks that they're just saying that because they clocked me and think I'm doing ""a good job"".

The latest example was today - a much older woman, I'm talking probably 60s - came up to me and got really close to me and said ""I just wanted to let you know I think you're a really pretty lady"" and not in a hitting-on-me sort of way. Again my mind immediately jumped to ""she just clocked me and is trying to make me feel good""

"Hello, all of you beautiful people! I have been lurking here for a good while now but it is my time to finally post something.

I'm 21 years old still living with my parents and younger brother (who is 20) I was able to finally (somehow) gather enough strength and courage to come out to my parents yesterday which was the hardest thing I have ever done and they were more supportive than I ever could have imagined! I felt very loved afterwards and like my body was going to run out of tears to shed. But anyways, my problem is I felt like after coming out to them the next few steps would be easier, but they aren't, not at all. My brother and I have a very unique relationship, we've been best friends our entire lives, we have experienced so many things together, we have spent more of our life together interacting/in the same presence than we have separate (if I had to guess) and I spent so much time and energy coming out to my parents because I knew that was the best way for me to get gender counseling/therapy to get my head sorted out to make sure I know this is what I want so I can start this thing! But now that I have come out to them I now have to face coming out to him, and I think it will be even harder than coming out to my parents... I gave my parents a 5 page long letter telling them, but with my brother I don't think a letter is the way to go, and I know him well enough that I have to be brief with him. I am going to have to tell him to his face, and I just don't know if I can do that... I have been balled up in my own forced masculine shell not allowing myself to show much emotion for so long now and my brother is used to that and I know if I start to cry (like I did perfusely when telling my parents) and generally being emotional about it I know it will freak him out because he doesn't like to see me in anguish... My dad keeps telling me that I need to stop worrying about protecting him and allow myself to worry about myself and my feelings over his right now since it is me who needs it right now not him, and that I should just tell him even if it does make him freeze up or panic a little... I know deep down he will support me too, but I can't help but feel that our relationship will forever drastically change after this and I don't know what I would do if I lost him over this, it would be like losing part of myself... I haven't talked to him at all about any of this, but he knows something is seriously up because I have been in total anxiety mode for a couple of weeks now as I was psyching myself up to tell my parents... How do I tell someone that close to me that I feel like I am and want more than anything to be a woman? How do I tell him something that I know he will not expect, something that won't only change my life forever but his as well because how close we are? I guess what I am asking is has anyone else been in such a position where they felt like they already did an impossible step during your transition but have to right afterwards do a possibly even bigger one? And how did you manage to pull through?

TL;DR: I felt like I did the impossible coming out to my parents but I feel like/I have to come out to my brother right afterwords who has been such a big part of my life that he might as well be my left arm? Has anyone experienced similar and if so how did you pull through it?

"Hi there.

I am still not 100% sure of being transgender(mtf), but I do think so. One thing that I'm not sure of how to feel about is that while I do want to transition the idea of people knowing that I'm a woman is not something that I desire. I want to transition for myself, to be happy with myself. The reason behind it it's that most people I've known so far in my life don't have a positive opinion of transgender people-- just becaue they're transgender. I don't want to be despised and to be treated as a less human being just because I want to live my life as I want to. Neither I want to be bullied or even having worse things happening to me. Sure, if everyone in this world would be aware that females are equal to males and that being transgender is not a goddamn disease I'd be more than happy to socially transition, but it isn't the case. I guess I'm just terrible afraid of destructive criticism towards my true self and possible physical harms. 

Because of what I've said, the idea of transitioning comes with fear, I just don't know what to do about it. I see people coming out despite their fear. I see people coming out on the worst of the places and that makes me feel like less of a trans, invalidating my own gender. Is it normal to feel like this? What should I do about it?",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Not saying this to brag, but I have the perfect radio voice. Right now I work behind the scenes in TV news (yes, everyone reads what I write) but would like to make the transition to on air for radio. I got that perfect, deep, Orson Welles radio voice... yet deeper than Welles.

But... enter the POSSIBILITY of me being trans (my therapist swears I'm in denial, I think I'm a good actor fooling her), and my dreams of being a radio or TV news star are zero.

But whatever, of the 3 things keeping me from ""trying out"" being trans, one is my voice. So let's work on it!

I'm terrified of a) my voice being too deep to not be passable and just sounding like Orson Welles in drag and b) having to always have a ""fake"" voice for the rest of my life.

But let's try it. Though I'm from a large city, I now live in a rural part of a rural state so I doubt the local university would have trans friendly speech people. So now I'm trying youtube.

I noticed this youtuber has a great voice and a pretty simple trick: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xu_vFkKq4g

* I have has obsessions with womens clothing for a long time, probably around 12.  Like certain types of womens clothes I had obsessions with. When I was 12/13 it was tights/stockings, when I was 14 it was sexy lingerie, then 15/16 it was dresses (especially prom dresses and short ones). 

* I first crossdressed when I was 6, when my sister ""forced me"" to. I put forced to in quote marks, because I liked it secretly but I was a boy, I'm not supposed to so I never actually did anything. I used to want more and more, it started off with a dress, then I wanted to wear a dress and makeup, hairbands, and acting like a princess.

* I'm not sure if I can trust these dypshoric thoughts. Like, I remember taking a mental health test online a few years ago, and it said I had ADHD, and another one said I had Scizophrenia. I got really worried and started thinking I had it, but in reality I know now I don't have it.

* I've known that there was something up with me when I was 8/9. I could never figure out what it was, but I just knew there was something up with me. I'm wondering if it has been gender dysphoria the whole time.

* I look in a mirror, I used to see a super masculine man and I liked it and thought I was attractive to girls, and I liked being masculine so I was more attractive. But now, I look in the mirror and I see a guy. I put girls clothes on, and think ""ew, a man in a dress"" and then get angry that I can't wear them. When I look in the mirror, it just doesn't look right, but I never used to be like that.

* I keep purpousely triggering the dysphoria. Like, today I was at a shopping centre, and generally when I am out the dysphoria is very low. Every time I saw someone who is female, I'd just think ""You want to be like her, don't you"" and I didn't really care and I just get really annoyed when I'm not dysphoric, because it makes me think I'm not transgender.

* My dysphoria is only really there when I'm alone in my room, especially at night. Like at night I feel suicidal about being born male and not female, when I am at school I question why I think that, or my thoughts go subconscious and it's only there when I am alone. I just think ""I can live as male fine at the moment, why do I want to be female so much"". I get depressed if I have some proof that I am cis, because that means I am not trans. I always think my life would of been better if I was AFAB.

* I feel like just forcing myself on HRT. Just force myself to be female. The fact I might not be able to get it makes me really depressed.

* Maybe I am just extremely curious what it's like to be female? I don't feel male anymore, a few months ago I was fine. I wear unisex clothes virtually everyday, and sometimes I have to remind myself I am male.  Again, a few months ago I never had to.

* I became obsessed with transgender topics in the past 6 months. Around July, I used to read stories about transgender people, trans love stories, all sorts, realized I am pansexual, but now I am starting to think that maybe I am just overly obsessed with transgender things, I want to be transgender, you know?

I want to see a therapist but I am too anxious to see one. GICs in the UK have such long waiting lists anyway.  I feel like they will just laugh at me and say I'm just some stupid confused 17 year old, turn me away. I've read things like the null hypothecis and that was dysphoria. I feel like I'm trying to make myself relate to it, but in reality I'm not. I can't trust my thoughts because I don't know how much of it is true and what isn't.

"I realized that I am trans (MtF) relatively recently. I'm definitely going to transition, but sometimes I am happy with the body that I have; not because I'm okay having a masculine body, but because it appears quite feminine. I'll look in the mirror and see full cheeks or look down and see wide hips (I don't have genital dysphoria so that part isn't an issue.) For a period of time during high school I was pretty convinced I had Klinefelter's Syndrome.

Can dysmorphia come and go like this? Have any other transgender people here experienced anything similar? Does anyone here have body dysphoria &amp; dysmorphia?

This is more of a matter of curiosity than anything, because if I do have body dysmorphia it is far from distressing, quite the opposite in fact.",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"First I am excited when I visit that thread. But after watching a couple of pictures I'm becoming uncertain about my own journey. (I am Pre-everything, only on PM. I can start real HRT in 2 weeks).

However, I think I maybe get exhausted when I see too much pictures of trans people in their mid-journey. It's like ""Is it really worth it?"" ""Am I really like them?"" I think all the questions coming up when I see people who's not passing despite a long time on HRT.

I do not want to be mean... mean no offense. But is this a normal feeling to get? My desire of transition is of course coming back after a while but it's just when I watch to many pictures of others I feel that the desire slowly going away.",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"Sorry, wall of text ahead. I don't even know what I am asking, I just feel like I need to share this. So last month I finally accepted that I am transgender and decided to go through with transitioning. I have no clue how I did not see it before, it has been so obvious my entire life. I even told my best friend over 3 years ago that I just wished I had been born a girl because that's how I have always felt, but nope, I was definitely not transgender. In the beginning of last year I felt really upset about not having breasts and never getting them because I was not transgender and therefore would never transition. I bought some bras, looked for ways to fill them and browsed for breast forms like crazy. I found it a bit strange that all the websites were for women who had a masectomy and for transgender people, because I wanted it so badly, but I was a cis male.

I am not sure what it was that just clicked last month and made me accept it and decide to transition, but ever since then I have been so happy. My depression and apathy have completely disappeared, I feel so energetic and want to do all the things I used to do, but didn't feel like I had the energy for. I got diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in the beginning of last year, and the doctor told me that it is very common to feel fatigued with that so I just thought that the lack of energy and will to do anything was because of the disease. Even more amazingly, after I made my decision practically all the symptoms of my colitis have disappeared, probably because the digestive system is so closely connected with your mental well being.

I started coming out to my friends just before Christmas. I told my first friend on the 21st and my god, I was so nervous. She was so incredibly sweet though and has been super supportive. Since then I have been working on telling more and more of my friends, and I even told my parents on my birthday this week! I had been really scared of how my dad would react, but he just told me that the most important thing is to be happy, and what you do to become happy is less important. I slept over at my parents house that night, and before going to bed my mom came to me with a necklace that has been passed down from mom to daugther for the last couple of generations and gave it to me. I am just so completely overwhelmed by the positivity of everyone.

On Tuesday I went to the doctor and told them that I would like to transition. She gave me a referral to the clinic that is responsible for treatment in my country and I am currently waiting for a time to go see them. My friend went with me to the doctor, and after the appointment she decided that it was time to go on a shopping trip. I bought my first collection of female clothes, and I have been wearing it in public and feeling super great about it this week. 

I don't know where I am going with all of this, I am just so incredibly happy to have started this journey, everything feels so right, it's absolutely amazing.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

Now, onto what this post is really about: how the appointment went! It went really well, and everyone at Planned Parenthood (which has started offering HRT, at least at the location near myself) was so kind and caring. They really do care, and they're all really open minded individuals who just want those they help to be happy. I digress. *sheepishly rubs my head* I started by talking to a social worker about stuff like why now, what kinds of stuff have I been working on in the past, home situation, support network, etc. Then, I went and saw a really nice nurse practitioner, and she went over my medical history and any medicines I'm on. Lastly, there were some physical stuff they wanted to check like blood pressure, weight and height, and, as I hadn't had one before, an STI test. (So far, the only one I've gotten results from was the HIV test, and that came back negative!) After that, they told me to wait about 5 days before picking up my prescription for E and spironolactone!

"I just finished watching A Series of Unfortunate Events on Netflix, and despite enjoying it immensely I feel really sad. I read all the books when I was a pre-teen, and I always  identified strongly with one of the main characters, Violet. I read them at a time where I was just beginning to realize I wanted to be a girl, and I felt like she was a fictional girl that I could aspire to be like. Watching the show really brought me back, and I guess I just keept feeling ""I can't be her, I'm not female."" I know I shouldn't think like that, but I can't help but be angry and sad at growing up as a boy. I feel like I lost the opportunity to have a well-developed personality that isn't focused around my deep-seated yearning to be a girl. So, in a nut shell, I feel like I lost the chance to ever aspire to be any female role-model I had because up until recently I always felt like it wasn't possible/allowed. I know I'm overthinking the hell out of this, but it's really upsetting me and I've been sobbing for about an hour. 

I sometimes get really hard on myself even though I've been on hormones for nearly a year, and I'm only 21. Also, I have parents that support me (financially, not emotionally at all) I just have a really hard time accepting I'm not female.

"Hi, everyone. First post, long-time lurker, throwaway account, I'm sure you'll understand. I'm an 18 (soon to be 19) -year old MtF. I've steadily realized more and more my true gender since puberty. I feel like my body is top-heavy, distorted, and malformed. Everything is wrong, and it has been getting steadily worse, what with hair and muscle mass and fat distribution and such. I hated my voice ever since I heard it played back to me at 14, and now try my damnedest to keep it higher. My parents found me out in the worst possible way about three years ago, and they basically threatened me with moving out with no monetary support if I followed through with it, saying it would give me more important things to worry about. As it was, they cut me off from the internet for three months, effectively severing my ties with my internet friends who they feared had influenced me. (By the way, they only looked at three months' worth of chat history. They don't even know that I brought it up to them first in every case.)

I think, more than anything, they just like having a son. Things keep changing for the worse, bodily-speaking, and I can't help but keep going back to the 'what if' of starting on things sooner, having the guts to bring it up properly to my parents, and how much happier I would be today. Now, instead, they're looking for voice coaches in our area so I can start using that absolutely disgusting-feeling bass tone. I'm grimacing just thinking about how the vibration feels in my throat. Hell, they didn't want me looking for clothes anywhere near the girls' section, nor even wear a flashy jangly silver bangle I've had for years (thanks to my claw machine skills). It's super-frustrating, especially considering how open-minded they appear to be regarding literally everything else.

So here I am. I'm lost, with no one to talk to but myself, afraid of what the future may hold, and still scared to re-tell them about it. I have occasional depression related to this situation, usually accompanied by crying fits that approach self-harm. I contemplated suicide at one point, although having helped a friend tough out similar suicidal thoughts once, I knew well enough not to follow through. I get cold sweats a lot, and I'm close to despair. All I know is that I can't try to tell them again, I can't move out and support myself, and I can't keep living in this slowly-crumbling nightmare of a body.

I'm sorry for such a massive downer of a post, but this is something I really need help with, and I believe you folks are the best to ask. What do you think would be a good path forward from here? Any type of information, ie. coping mechanisms, self-experience, etc. is appreciated. (Also, I hope this is easy enough to read/understand; I wrote this late last night on a mobile device. Ask questions if you need to. I'll answer almost anything.) Thanks, everyone. ^ ^

Sending my love ~&lt;3



UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the advice, and helping me to work things through. I did - barely - manage to talk to one of my parents about the voice coaching (and ended up in cold sweats in the process); it was apparently received pretty well, and now they're okay with however I want to sound, as long as I still take classes for vocal clarity and projection. That's a huge weight off my shoulders, so thank you again for providing support and giving me the confidence to at least make it to here so far. &lt;3",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"Sometimes, the feelings of being transgend; wanting to be a girl, are stronger then other times, why?

I never liked being called 'son' to my knowledge, but I didn't have strong feelings of being transgender until a few years ago. I didn't go towards my Sister's stuff, probably wasn't into the colour Pink, that I know of.

Why did it start recently?
There were signs, and there were feelings of wanting to be girl before I started have strong feelings...
That is one of things that confused me, and that is what one of the things holding my parents back from accepting/believing I am trans. No one said they seen any signs, or maybe that is a bit willing to forget?

"I don't feel like a boy, and I don't feel like a girl. And I especially feel like I don't belong anywhere. I've been lurking on this sub for about 3 years now, and the couple of posts I've made haven't gotten any attention or haven't helped me solve *any* of my problems. And I don't blame anyone, because I know I haven't found a way to word how I feel in a way that fully communicates the emotions. With that's said, I guess I don't really know what I'm going for here, but I'd call this a last ditch effort for some help, because I'm getting to the point where I don't care anymore.

I constantly feel like there is a battle between two people inside of me: my feminine side and my masculine side. I am uncomfortable with both of them because I feel completely alien to ""being a man"" and ""being a woman."" I don't know what either means, but the more and more I experiment with each, the more and more I feel out of my element. 

This is where I lose the ability to really capture how both sides of my personality feel and the only way I can think to do it is with a list. So here goes:

My feminine side is largely focused around appearances (which I don't really like) and relationships. I want to feel pretty, I want to have smooth skin and longer hair, and I wish I was shorter. I wish I had more freedom in my clothing, and I would love to learn about makeup. I want to be loved and held and desired, and I want to be fucked and pleasured by a man. It hurts to say all of that because for some reason I feel like I'm disrespecting trans and cis women, but it also feels natural in some way.

My masculine side doesn't care for anything above. Honestly I don't know what it wants, because when I feel masculine, I feel like just another guy, aside from the constant nagging at the back of my head saying ""something is off."" This site of me feels easiest to fake, because I've had to act like a boy my whole life.

"Hey there, so first off I have recently become active in the reddit world, and outside perspectives are great. Everybody has so much info to offer, the knowledge of everybody combined is amazing. That being said, I mean no harm and hope my confusion does not offend anybody. 

So I am young twenties and quite masculine, muscular build, facial hair, fish, outdoor stuff blah blah. Ive had gf's in the past and have enjoyed heterosexual relationships. For years I have always kinda cross dressed. Never hardcore, but something as simple as slipping on some sexy panties before I sleep. When I do this at first I have a sexual thrill, As I step my legs through I feel a rush and I am quite turned on... erect. After a few minutes I become flacid and usually tuck everything away. I will remain like this until I awake. Recently I have been exploring some sexual desires with other men. I have been with one guy quite a few times and we are confortable with each other. I do enjoy performing sex acts that generally females do. For example I enjoy giving head but would never like to recieve. I love being a bottom but could never bring myself to top.  As I do them I often begin to picture myself as a female. He is very open minded and we discussed my slight crossdressing habits. He is cool with it. So recently when I have gone to hang out with him, I tend to shave my entire body down to my knees, wear panties and head over. When I am shaved smooth and wearing feminine underwear I feel more fem and kinda act more fem. Needles to say I enjoy everything alot more. For example recently I sometimes put on lipgloss before giving head, it just makes everything feel right. 

What gets me is that I only like to do all of this when I am with him being sexual. I have zero desire to go about daily life, school, work, as a female. But when I am with him sexually I wish I were full female, hair, boobs, but, ect... Like I would enjoy being a passing female and have guys dance with me at a club and try to hook up, but if I were just going to see a movie with friends or do athletic type things I would be more comfortable being a guy. So this just confuses me... Any thoughts?

"I only have one face to work with, so this probably isn't a universal thing, just something to maybe look into if you want a super smooth face and aren't already doing this.

1. The biggest thing that helps me avoid pain that ultimately comes from shaving every day for is to go super slow.  I went from taking two minutes shaving to taking probably seven or eight, but the extra time has been worth it.

2. I shave against the grain, but not initially.  I always shave my face along the grain and then go back over it in the opposite direction very lightly to completely get rid of them. You don't have to take care of every single hair on the first pass, I usually do several very light passes against the grain until I stop feeling hairs being cut.  I used to get ingrown hairs fairly often (once every two or three weeks) and shaving forwards then backwards seems to have helped with that.

3. Use moisturizer, acne cream, or just any kind of face wash right after you shave.

"I love questions. I love having answers more. I hate not having the answer. And that in a nutshell is how I ended up here. I ask myself who I am, and to put it bluntly, I have no fucking idea.  At nearly 30, I would have hoped to have that one down. But alas...


Do I think I knew at any point? I doubt it, if I sit here any reflect. I just got on with life with what I had, not taking risks and not making any changes. See, that is something I'm terrible at - enacting change and/or taking risks. Throw something new at me and I adapt in the blink of an eye. However I will never be the one to make (major) things happen unless my hand is forced by reaching a point where to not act would be worse.

I could easily bog this post down, one which is already long enough, with a massive brain dump, but I'm trying here to keep it to what is pertinent to why I'm writing this. I've had the *'am I trans or is this something else'* question pop by for a visit a number of times since my teens. I never really experienced any dysphoria (as I would think of it) growing up. I would always say no and it would pass - I would get on with my life.


Fast forward to a couple of years back (mid-to-late twenties). I came out to a friend and then a few others as non-cis (or some sort of genderfluid varient). I had concluded that the 'trans' feeling was real in some way (quote Dumbledore: *""Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?""*). 


As time has gone on, letting the catch loose on the box in my mind holding onto the gender disquiet has lead to these thoughts developing. There has been a much louder discontent at not being AFAB, but no real change in terms of how I feel at being AMAB. 


The friends I mentioned above were a support network for me to explore how far I wanted to push my non-cis identity/presentation, but each and every single one is suffering considerably from their own issues now, so they cannot be a post to lean on, and thus I've had to rely on introspection.


I then finally had a chat with a trans friend/acquaintance to see if I could get some insight on what to do and what journeys I could take. She said many things, some relevant to me and others where we are quite different. But she definitely was kick in the behind to act sooner rather than later if that's what I want/need to do.


So, me being me and never taking action (~15 years of prior inaction on this) had still done nothing 3 months later. But then we get to the present day...


I needed to make a GP appointment about a separate issue. Ignore that it took having an ulterior motive, I feel that I should also raise the whole gender ID thing at same time as I cannot avoid the truth of it being a 'thing' any longer. However, I have no idea what to say or ask; I'm still yet to conclude that 'I am a woman' (if I ever will) nor could I say I would be committing to any sort of transition.


So, the appointment is on Tuesday. What do I do or what I am asking for? I know each person is difference, but some advice would be hugely welcome.

"Our bodies, especially pre or mid transition, are subject to some harsh judgement, and we are usually the harshest on ourselves.

So, tell me something you like about your appearance. Maybe you have an ass that improves every pair of jeans you put it in. Maybe your hair is awesome. Perhaps it is something as simple as everyone saying you have nice eyes.

Even if you are pre everything or in an awkward stage, try and find something to like about yourself, even if it is something you like for the potential it has as you change  and develop confidence over time (one day when my chest hair covers the scars more, I am going to rock the leather jacket with no shirt look).",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"So I stared going to my college gym. I am pre-everything with very obvious facial/body hair. In the nude, there is nothing physically that would point to me being a woman besides my painted nails. 

I have to go before class a couple times a week, necessitating a shower. So, since I marked M on my paperwork to match my legal name and other paperwork, I used the men's locker. No big deal first time, but second there were people in there with me. I stalled until no one was in the shower, then sprinted to a stall to get dressed so no one would see my bra. 

I would have felt more comfortable in the women's I think, but at the same time, I do need to think of others. That is just who I am. I am gaining a lot of confidence presenting feminine in public, but that is clothing. This isn't. Just as I have the right to feel comfortable, safe, and secure, don't those around me have the same right? I know the company line in this sub is ""you do you"" with an implied ""to hell with the rest"" but that just isn't who I am...

If any of you amazing ladies and gentlemen have any advise or suggestions of how to deal with this, I would love to hear from you!

Update: 

Met with manager of the wellness center on campus. She was awesome and very understanding. She showed me the women's locker room, it does have individual shower stalls instead of the communal crap men are forced to deal with and stressed that she wants me to feel comfortable. She was very happy I came in to meet with her rather than communicating via email. It was stressful, but at the same time good practice socializing as my preferred gender.

"I just got off the phone with my insurance's nurse hotline where it was confirmed that I have been lied to and have been treated unethically.

I successfully transitioned a little over 10 years ago and there has never been an issue when it comes to my healthcare. However, I went in to see a doctor, a pcp, as I have a nerve issue in my arm. She whizzed into the room, introduced herself and without missing a beat started to grill me on my hormones. ""Where did you get the hormones? Who gave them to you? When did you start taking them? hormones, Hormones, HORMONES!!!!"" After 15 minutes of this crap, I had to remind her that I was there because of my arm; I made NO mention of needing, wanting, or even a refill on the damn things. She wasn't interested in my arm. I made the mistake of mentioning depression and then she left the room for another 15 minutes to check on my mental health benefits, came back in and lied straight to my face and told me that my CURRENT therapist no longer takes my insurance and the closest person who accepted my insurance was 2 towns over. I called the next day to confirm and was told, ""Yes, we take your insurance."" Again, I directed her back to my arm where she told me the pain and numbness I was experiencing was ""all in my head"". I asked her if I should instead see an orthopedist or specialist regarding my arm when she once again lied straight to my face and told me that I needed to have dealt with the nerve pain for AT LEAST 6 months before even beginning to entertain seeing a specialist. (I was told on the nurse's hotline that this is a tactic used to try and get someone to look for another provider. Was also told that a specialist should be looked into only after ~4 weeks, NOT 6 months.) She then told me to go see a physical therapist, get a cortisone shot and to hope for the best right before telling me to find another doctor and to get out of her office. 

I will most definitely be reporting her to the medical board, insurance, and her local admin.

Can a doctor refuse to treat you only after the initial visit simply for being trans?

Honestly, I'm sitting here slack-jawed. I spent the first 7 years of my female life in Texas and only encountered 2 instances of discrimination. I have experienced more discrimination in the past 5 months that I've been in this little shitty town right outside Seattle, SEATTLE!!!, than I ever did in my 30 years in Texas. Regarding my arm, I have been to the ER, urgent care, sports medicine, and that shitty pcp dr and have been stonewalled at each one. I don't understand this. I thought this area was accepting... With the exception of the pcp, it has been the same scenario each time: ""Oh hi! I'm doctor so-in-so. Are you allergic to any meds? When was your last period?"" Oh, I'm sorry, I'm transgender. It is at this point their affect completely changes. No eye contact, the friendliness is dropped from their voice, and they are looking to get out of the room asap.

I did go once into Seattle proper to an overnight clinic where I was finally treated as a person; unfortunately, the nurse practitioner was not able to refer me out to a specialist for some reason. My transness did not come up once. I don't feel I should have to go a town over for fucking medical treatment but it looks like I might have to.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Hey everyone! u/imfinethough here, I created this account expressly for the purpose of the username. As an update to the thread I made here about a week ago, I've decided to open up my schedule to give voice lessons/help to trans women over skype. I've gotten a lot of questions over the years as to how I found my voice, and it's hard to describe something so in-depth and complex over PM, so that's why I've elected to help people one-on-one, and give them specific advice.    

I'm currently looking for a new job right now, but ideally, this is something I'd like to do full-time - I would really love to be a cheap resource for trans women who can't afford to spend $70-100 an hour for voice help. So I've decided to do a sort of...reverse sliding-scale, in regards to payment? I want to charge $20 an hour, but if you think I deserve more or you want to help me keep it a full time job, then by all means :D hopefully that sounds fair to everyone!     

I understand there are already voice guides out there, and I also just want to sort of...supplement them, I guess? Some people are capable of teaching themselves just from guides but it might help to have someone else give you direct feedback for where you're at and what you can work on.    

Also, I just want to be available as a resource in general. Let's say we're 45 min through the session and you've already gotten enough to work on for the next session, but you need help with something else like makeup or where to find informed consent clinics, or how to come out to your parents or whatever...it's all stuff I've done before so I don't mind helping you out with whatever else you might need :) I've given plenty of advice here over the years also hopefully people who've been here for a while can vouch that I'm a good resource haha.    

Feel free to comment here with any questions, or send me PMs! Also the email I've set up for this is mtfvoicehelp@gmail.com, you can reach me at either if you want to schedule a session. It would help to send your best days/times in the email so I can cross reference it with my openings and get back to you :)

"Some backstory for clarity:
I'm a 21, soon to be 22 year old student in the UK. I'm in my final semester, and I've known I'm not happy with my gender for nearly 2 years. I've explored things such as crossdressing, presenting as female, even as far as looking into HRT via private means.

When I told my parents how I felt, I sent them an email and we had a long discussion over Christmas. The reaction has been pretty negative, they seem pretty uneducated in terms of anything 'truely' trans, saying things like 'We watched a program on TV, we know how it is' using derogatory terms you might find someone with a trans fetish using. I understand its hard for them, I truly have considered that, and do understand as much as I can, but now I wish I never told them, its just become a huge problem, even though i told them out of respect for them to know how I was feeling after so long.

They've made it perfectly clear they don't want me doing anything female, my dad especially, he makes snide comments about even tiny things like the length of my nails, not that I've exactly been manly either growing up but according to them 'I never showed any signs'. My mum says things like 'You don't have to take anything, its bad for you' and that 'It messes you up, people regret transitioning' I feel they are being very selfish with the whole situation, pretty much only explaining how it affects them and that I've not considered it, when they haven't even asked me anything like how I feel or really anything at all. They assume I'm just going to be selfish and that I don't care about their opinions, purposely upsetting them for the hell of it.

They refuse to listen to my reasoning that I've done TONS of reading watched TONS of videos and talked with medical and psychological professionals for therapy, and thought so damn hard about every little detail. They are very much in the mindset of 'sex = gender' and I fear they will not make the effort to educate themselves even if I provide the means to do so. My dysphoria is getting worse and worse, I hate aging as a male, and I hate even more the thought of living like this forever. I've wanted to do what I'm studying for my entire life, and I've pushed so hard to get where I am, I feel like my life will finally start when I graduate and I don't want my self hatred getting in the way of my life when I know deep down I'm happier as female. I don't know what to do anymore. I thought I'd get some sort of support form my parents being as they said 'we always will love you' and apparently it would be fine if I was gay, but not this. (Side note, I'm not gay, very much attracted in females thanks)

I'm mostly independent from my parents here at uni, they don't loan me money or anything, but when I graduate I won't have student accommodation for long and I will have to find a job, I visit them on the holidays. They refuse to acknowledge what I've told them, seemingly if not talking about it will make all the bad things go away. I'm not suddenly going to up and change immediately to full girl mode if I get HRT, I understand that process takes time, but BECAUSE it takes time, I want to start now, I've done my waiting and my parents are like the last obstacle.

I guess I'm just looking for advice, I know no one can give me a answer that will solve my problems, and I don't expect people to make my life choices for me but I feel my parents are stopping me from making this choice, because I'm being too considerate with their wishes...Did anyone else have these issue with their parents and how did you overcome them, if at all?

TLDR; I want HRT but my parents simply 'don't want me too because imagine how that will make us feel' I'm sick of waiting and don't want to get to a point in my life where my self hatred overtakes my passion for things I do and enjoy.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Hi. My girlfriend is trans and she and I are trying to get as much information about transitioning as we can before jumping into HRT or anything similar. She definitely wants to have SRS down the line (I'm not sure if that's still the appropriate term or not), but we're not clear on the requirements and/or costs. So, to those who have undergone SRS, I have a few questions:

* Is the procedure covered by any US insurance plans if she secures a diagnosis from a mental health professional, or are we doomed to pay out of pocket? 

* If we *are* to pay out of pocket, how much can we expect to pay?

* What are some realistic expectations? Will she be placed on a waiting list for five years after securing the necessary documents? Is it difficult to find a surgeon willing to do the procedure? Will her PCP/mental health professional help her find a surgeon?

* Is it recommended to find a surgeon to perform an orchidectomy prior to SRS, or possibly HRT? (We've read that an orchidectomy would give her better results during HRT.)

If you guys could answer any of these questions, I would be super grateful! Thank you so much.",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I may be getting to transition soon, I'm mtf/genderfluid, and honestly I don't know if I want to transition. And when I do, I feel like I'll never be cute or be a true girl. I feel like I don't belong with any gender anymore. ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"I talked with my mom today. We got into me being transgender and she finally asked if I wanted to be a girl. I ended up indirectly admitting that I am not so much for the social parts but I want a female body.

After questioning me if I wanted to change it all up etc putting me on the spot she entered another line of discussion that was related to something I had mentioned earlier. She told me that the consequences I should seek were those that did not kill me. I admitted there that I was probably hit a point if I did nothing where the pain I believe I am feeling will kill me.

She eventually told me that maybe I needed to find balance and myself, that I should put this aside and confirm who I am personality wise. Even suggesting that I travel to other countries etc to take a break from thinking about being trans. I sort of wanted to yell at her by then that 'I can't choose to not think about being trans but I did not. She followed by telling me that I should be true to my inner self and let go of my outer self. I told her that I would be the same but it was my body in where the problem lied and then she told me in a loud voice that ""this is not about your body!"" like the title and repeated the same thing as earlier.

Following this she asked if I hated my body which I admitted that I did and now she returnt to my surgery which she tried to use to explain me being trans. I had genitalia surgery that affected the appearance of them and she told me somehow that this had changed me and maybe that was why I hated my body. I tried reminding her that I had feelings like this before that during a hard time in my life. She did not truly buy that but my dad got home then and we had to quit. She told me in the end that they would 'accept' whatever choice I made.

Entering that conversation was during a all time high feeling emotionally although afraid to tell anyone in my gender but it left me an emotional wreck without any form of finality. I almost broke down when I got out of her site. I don't know why but exactly the same mood in that conversation has triggered a fight and irritation before and completly ruined my sense of security. I always start doubting feeling wrong and that I am a freak starting unnecessary problems.

My mother also specifically wanted me to talk to my psychiatrist about the genital surgery and get that 'fixed'.....

My parents want grandchildren and reminded me of this several times. They also keep telling me that they will accept me whatever I choose but that acceptance is based around me remaining male or risk of death. Not true acceptance. 

Both have at several times indirectly implied and pushed me towards 'remaining me'. 

I can't think of nor desire anything in the future really except being trans right now which also stresses the shit out of me...

I don't know anymore what to do and I am afraid of telling my parents that those conversations hurt...

"I've been going in circles w/ my questioning after about 5 months of doing so now. I'm making no progress lately so I was about to just stop questioning for awhile. Then after reading a trans women's experience on an old post, I realized mine has been almost word for word just like hers w/ very minor differences. I'll copy the comment below:


As I started having thoughts about sex and started actually having a libido, I found myself having sexual thoughts about being a girl. I'd imagine myself being physically female and everything and it was about the only fantasy that I really enjoyed. I would usually fantasize about having lesbian sex with someone.

I have a sort of fetish for transformation stuff as well which I honestly don't understand very well, but I think it comes from growing up with cartoons and other kids' shows that always had transformation elements in their stories. Animorphs, Street Sharks, stuff like that. When I was growing up I'd frequently fantasize about shapeshifting into various things. I found that gender swaps were the most interesting however, especially when it was a boy being turned into a girl. One that sticks out in particular is the episode of The Fairly Odd Parents where Timmy gets himself turned into a girl, which apparently aired when I was 11 years old. Most boys would find the idea of that happening to them pretty weird or awful, but I wanted that to happen to me more than anything.

When my sexuality kicked in and I started fantasizing about being a girl sexually, a certain part of my imagination sort of got wrapped up in it and I'd start fantasizing about not just being a girl, but being turned into one. I'd imagine myself growing breasts and losing my penis and getting a vagina in its place, my face changing and my skin softening, etc.

This was all before I knew anything about transition. This was before I knew anything about male and female hormones, and before I really understood the difference between male and female puberties.

I desperately wanted to grow breasts and a vagina, because I desperately wanted to go to school and live as a girl. I felt like a girl sexually and mentally, so much so that for a while I thought I could actually just sort of ""think"" it into happening, like if I wanted it strongly enough or prayed every night, I would just eventually start growing breasts and lose my penis. Obviously that never worked and after a while I just gave up on the idea of becoming a girl, and instead just looked at all of my behavior as a sexual fetish.

I eventually found myself google searching for websites that had stories and comics about boys/men being turned into girls/women, and that became the porn and erotica I looked at regularly for the next several years. I also remember going on YouTube and looking for various videos where a guy would be turned into a girl.

I did not always accept this behavior of mine however, and for a while I constantly tried to prevent myself from wanting to be a girl or having sexual fantasies where I was or became one. I tried thinking about having penis-in-vagina sex with a woman but it was just never appealing to me, and I got really frustrated that I wasn't normal.

"Am I just a cross dresser or am I transgender? 

I cross dress a lot, and it is very euphoric and sexual for me. I can only ever get off by imagining myself as a woman and acting stereotypically feminine sexually.

I used to think this was just a fetish but now I am not so sure and I feel it may be linked to something deeper.

For starters sometimes, (aka when I am not blocking it out (I think,)) I really wish I was born a girl. I get jealous of woman all the time, and whenever I see an average or attractive woman I just want to be her, and not just in a sexual way but just in general, wanting to be a woman.

And that's another thing I have been noticing for some time; when I cross dress it is no longer purely sexual; I get a sense of euphoria, energy, happiness, peace/relaxation, and it just sort of feels right. I find myself sometimes sleeping dressed up and it is always such a deep full filling sleep.

I have had these urges/desires since I was a kid, and have routinely repressed them and blocked them out by going what I call ""man mode,"" where I will immerse myself in masculinity as much as possible, to compensate.

 I'll lift heavy weights, go on the heavy boxing bag, beast mode any exercise, expose myself to cold temperatures with light clothing until I can't notice it any more, only ever wearing a t shirt even if it's frozen over outside, ignore pain, speak as deeply as I can, try to snuff out any feminine mannerisms, religiously avoid anything remotely feminine, blunt my emotions, the list just goes on and on...

 But while I am doing all of this man mode stuff I get constant intrusive thoughts (I have severe ocd) about being a girl. Relentlessly. I can't even be in the same room as a girly advert without it triggering me immensely and making me intensely stressed. We have a pink curtain in the dining room and if it touches me while I am in man mode I can just feel the cortisol surging.

So eventually I give into these intrusive thoughts and urges, usually around the time they tune into intrusive intoxicating dreams about being a woman. And it feels great. I dress up again, get very aroused, watch girly tv shows while dressed just feeling great and imagining myself as a woman, being jealous of all the woman in the shows etc.

Then of course I get all paranoid and guilty and go man mode again. Just a constant cycle.

I have made a couple posts about this and from what I have been reading it is looking good like I may well be transgender, but would soooo appreciate more opinions. Please feel free to check my 2 other posts about this topic for more insight!

It's just so hard to get it all out there, to explain the situation accurately and there are so many different opinions on here.

"Hello everyone, I'm a cis male and I've got a question about sexual preferences and pornography. I'm attracted to women with penises, and often look at porn depicting such women.  However I've seen people saying that this whole genre of porn is dehumanizing and fetishizing of trans women. This is something that I've been thinking about recently, and I'm worried I may be doing something morally wrong. 

I try to be kind to people, and I respect trans women as much as anyone else. I'm attracted to women with penises in the same way someone may be attracted to people with blonde hair or well-defined muscles; It's a trait I think makes someone sexy. But is this objectification? Is porn depicting transgender women harmful to the community? I'd like to ask you all your opinions on this matter.

"I've been seeing a therapist for a few weeks, and I'm finally opening up more about my problems, but the one thing that always makes me choke is talking about gender identity and dysphoria. So, we always just move on to a different subject.

I don't know why It is so hard, this is one of the main reasons I'm seeing a therapist anyway. I'm afraid to talk about it, maybe because I've literally never verbally talked about it, but, I don't know. I just feel like I'm lying to my therapist whenever its brought up, and I feel guilty. No matter how true my feelings are, I feel guilty when I talk about them. It has been *my* secret for so long, I just don't know how to express it to anyone else.

I don't really know what I'm asking here, but it's bothering me like no other. I just want to be able to express my feelings to the person who is there to help me. It probably has to do with my anxiety.

"Hi ya'll, a bit of context before the question: my fiancÃ©e and I have been together for three years now, since we started college, but we come from two very different families. My mom &amp; I have always lived in metropolitan cities &amp; are very politically, socially, &amp; empathetically liberal. Her folks are rooted conservative wealthy midwesterners.  Last night they came to town to have dinner after my birthday andâ€”needless to sayâ€”they knew something was different. They spent all night lecturing us and reminding us that after graduation (a few months from now) they'd feel totally fine cutting off any financial support. It was clear why they said this; they both noticed I think, the changes in my face, and when we hugged good by I know they noticed the little boobs that have formed.

My fiancÃ©e has always been close to her family and I like them too. But I'm worried about coming out, soon at the rate things are changing, and ruining her family life &amp; her relationships.

However, my feelings over the last year have changed immensely, and I realized that the similarity to my deadname was bothering me, so after some reluctance I changed my name to Naomi about three weeks ago (not legally but). Feels kind of embarrassing, but I think it is better this way. Was just wondering if anybody here has done this sort of thing, maybe even for similar reasons?

I'm a pre-anything MtF who's had a few bad days. I'm working on getting my transition under way, but everything feels SO SLOW. Anyway, wanted to start feeling more feminine around the house and through the day, and decided that making my junk less prominent would be a good start. 

I researched tucking last night (researched again really, I'd been curious since before I accepted I'm trans), and gave all 3 methods I'd found a try. First, sit on toilet, tuck everything back, close legs, and slowly stand. No good. Next, pull the penis gently back between the legs, and the tesyes should tuck themselves. Nope. Finally, actually using my hands to try to guide the testes into the canal that's supposed to be there. Worst yet. Couldn't find the canal, or couldn't get the tastes is, and quickly got so frustrated / grossed out / nervous (my worst dysphoria ever) I had to stop after about a minute of trying. Then I got angry and frustrated because I so rarely get grossed out or frustrated to the point of rage quitting whatever I'm doing. Ruined my evening, and now is continuing to ruin my day.

I've told several friends of my struggles as of late, with no definite yes or no either way (online only, I'm wayyy too scared to talk to anyone about this that I'd have to look in the eye).

"
hey 

I am a guy who lives in a female body.
I am part of an unintegrated personality (i/we have a complex dissociative disorder) so I don't really identify as trans as such but instead I think of myself as a cross-gender-alter.
Because of that particular situation I've always wondered if certain parts of my experience are shared by (some) trans people with an integrated personality (ie people not dealing with a complex dissociative disorder/not identifying as multiple/plural) so I wondered if any of you would indulge my curiosity?

1. So I am a guy. I've been a guy for as long as I've had a concept of gender but obviously my sex doesn't match. Do you also feel that you ARE and have always been your preferred gender, even though your sex doesn't match?

2. Personally I believe gender is for the most part a social construct - I don't think there is really any inherent difference between women and men other than their biology. I don't believe that that biology has a significant bearing on 
personality, likes, dislikes, wants etc. I am convinced we're all the same when we're kids but people who are viewed as girls are encouraged to be more aware of and nurture their ""feminine"" traits and are shamed (maybe in the home but definitely by societal norms) into repressing/being less aware of their traits perceived as ""masculine"" but to me all traits/behaviours thought of as ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" are in reality all just part of being human,  Whether we dare acknowledge the full gumot of them in our self or not.
 
so given the above opinion it's kind of mind bendy that I am a dude when my body's sex is clearly female.  
Is it really just about your sex for you (like for me - something sure is missing) or is actually about gender and if so what does gender mean to you? Do you perceive an inherent difference between guys and girls? 

3 
Obviously mirrors and bathrooms and all that is torturous but do you recognize yourself in your facial features? Does that look like a versison of yourself, just of the wrong sex?
I am asking because my internal self image is a far cry from my physical reality. For instance, I am convinced I have a different hair and eye colour to what my body really has. I expect myself to be a slightly different height and build (even though I understand my physical reality). Do you share similar feelings about your physical appearance?

I am sure there are about 3 million things I am forgetting right now.


EDIT: Thought of one of the millions. I am pretty closeted although I am out with a couple of people. Do you feel odd around people of what is per your internal experience the opposit gender? I am straight (seen from my viewpoint anyway). I think that plays a role in why I have this guilt over not disclosing that I experience myself as male.  I feel that women would react differently to me if they knew that's how I identify. Like, there would be less physical closeness etc. so eventhough I know I have a right to privacy that doesn't really compute and I feel like an interloper, like i am taking advantage just by existing. That's really stifling me making connections with people AT ALL. And I don't mean sexual, I mean AT ALL. Anyone struggle with similar guilt/shame?


Any responses will be much appreciated

Thanks

"For those who don't know, *The Trans Girl Diaries* is a webcomic. I know it's reasonably popular because I see it around, but the domain for the hosting site appears to have expired and all the strips are lost.

"I went to my first trans support group a few days ago and I have to say I feel worse having gone to it.  Hearing the challenges and difficulties of people who are mid-transition was terrifying and heart breaking.  I've never been more afraid to take the next step than I am now.  

Finding a home after 5 months of being homeless because your landlord kicked you out for being trans or finding a part-time minimum wage job after you got fired for coming out as trans at your previous job are not things that should have to be celebrated.  These are basic and essential human rights.  I know there is still a lot of trans discrimination in the U.S. but I live in a very progressive city and had thought we were much further along in our society than we seem to be.

Aside from living with crippling dysphoria I have a pretty good lifeâ€“â€“I have a master's degree, I am pursuing my dream career, I have a car and a safe place to live, etc.  Does coming out mean I will potentially be giving some of these things up?  I don't want a good day in my life to be one where I don't get harassed or where I find a home to live in after I'm homeless just for being trans.  

Does anyone else understand what I'm going through?  Can you offer any advice on how to cope with this feeling?

"Hi, first time posting here. So I've more or less considered myself to be trans (MtF) for about two years now. At one point I considered self medicating but I decided I didn't want to risk, uh, dying.

So, now I guess I want to do it the ""legit"" way, by going to a therapist/specialist and getting a diagnosis. But I just realized that I actually have no idea how I'm supposed to do that.

Where do I even start? Additionally, is there any way I can do this without my parents knowing? I'm 20, but I still live with them and am financially dependent on them. I don't have a job right now, but that may change soon.

How long might I expect it to take to get a diagnosis and prescription? Would being totally honest about how I feel about everything make it harder to get them? It's not like I never have doubts about this, but I've heard a lot of horror stories about how some therapists really just want you to fit totally neatly into the common ""i've always known for sure since i was born and i only ever like to do girl things"" narrative and I would also like some insight into how true that is. I would like to use this as an opportunity to talk about the things that bother me but not if it's just going to just hurt me in the long-run if I get denied treatment because I wasn't convincing enough to them or something.

2. Are you satisfied with how contemporary feminist politics approaches trans/queer issues?

* ""Do I really want to live life as a girl? It's easier to live life as a guy, I can do it well, and I'm popular as a guy. I have no idea how to live life as a girl, dress correctly, or hold myself in a feminine manner.""

* I've never had a male libido. I've never had the want or desire to do anything with a girl. I'm now having a lot of flash desires (flash because they don't last long) towards hooking up with a girl. Which I don't understand because I like men, but I'm too scared to do anything with them. 

* ""I'm not going to make a good girl and successfully transition. I don't shave my legs regularly, my voice sucks, and whenever I tell people I'm trans they say they can't believe it because I act so masculine.""

A lot of my reservations are based out of fear but I'm not sure if I can overcome those. I can't help but wonder if I'm actually not transgender deep down and that I'm making a huge mistake by trying to transition and all I am is a crossdresser who isn't okay with the idea of a man dressing in woman's clothing so I'm trying to change my whole gender so that it's okay in my mind.

The flip side of that however is I can't imagine a future as a guy. I have no dreams, no aspirations, or any desire to really do anything in this life as a male.

My plan from the beginning has been to bank before HRT, now I basically have the greenlight for HRT from my therapist and endo but I can't get in to see a urologist about banking until late next month at the earliest.

Hi all! I'm a deaf person with bilateral cochlear implants (one on each side) and I've always had problems with my maps (programming of the implants to resemble a hearing 'map' of a non-hearing impaired person). A lot of things can influence the maps such as hormones which was what happened during puberty. So I'm interested in taking hormones but I really do not want to change my maps because that involves a lot of audiology appointments which involves money and is basically a headache for all involved. I'm also not out to anyone so I can't just go ask my audiologist about this. So I wanted to see if theirs anyone on this subreddit that can help with this question. Thanks!,gender_dysphoria_disorder
"After 4 months on hormones I find myself experiences more and more sever bouts of dysphoria.  It's all starting to add up and culminate in one giant mess of emotions that I don't know if I can handle.  I'm still presenting as a male, and feel like, although I am out to most people, my job makes it impossible to transition halfway through the year.  I am a teacher, and although I have the support from my school, it would be way too hard on the kids to come back one weekend and have gone from Mr. To miss.

Girl me is trapped in my apartment it's beginning to really drive me crazy.  Additionally, the dysphoria I am experiencing from my body issues has been the worst it's ever been.  Am I putting to much faith in hormones?  I look at my body, and I am just grossed out and infuriated with what I see.  Even though my legs are shaved, I've had a few laser sessions on my face and I feel like I began in a really good starting place in regards to my height/weight.  However, when I look in the mirror I HATE my face.  It's like hormones are making me realize just how much I really hate my body?  In a weird way, there is an exhilarating rush that comes with these feelings, because although they cause me physical and mental distress, they at least validate my questioning of my gender identity.  I guess that's a good silver lining.

"I show a lot of signs of being trans: fixation on anything with gender bender / crossdressing / trans elements, daydreaming consistently about being or turning into a girl/woman for years (and dying in all other fantasies), using a girl's name online for no particular reason and liking being called she, the magic button test, etc. But I don't think I really feel dysphoria exactly, which makes me worry that this is an idle but unimportant fantasy that I have ascribed too much significance to.

Socially, being called ""he"" never bothered me before I started thinking about all this stuff consciously, and it still only feels kind of off, which could easily just be because I'm expecting (hoping?) for it to feel off. (Except when I use a feminine name online, being called ""he"" in that context always felt pretty bad.) There are aspects to being perceived as male that I don't like, like that I might be automatically perceived as a threat, and I feel like I would rather be seen as a woman, but I don't hate being male or anything.

Physically, again, I'm not sure I actually feel any dysphoria. I mean, I've always been embarrassed about my body hair (avoided swimming / buttoned shirts too high / avoided shorts so that people wouldn't see my chest/leg hair), and I've felt better now that I've shaved them off, but I'm not sure that's a strong enough feeling to count? Maybe it's a definitional thing. If a trans woman doesn't like her receding hairline, we say it's dysphoria, but if a cis man doesn't like his receding hairline, we don't? If someone who hasn't learned to shave yet obsessively uses scissors each day to cut off every piece of their beard that's long enough to cut, is that dysphoria, or is it just that some/most men prefer to be cleanshaven anyhow? I've never especially liked my body after puberty (except my hands which are unusually small), but not in an obvious BREASTS SHOULD BE HERE sense?

The only time I've felt something similar to how I've heard dysphoria described was a weird panic attack (the only panic attack I've ever had) where I held a skirt up in front of me in front of a store mirror to see how it would look, and had this overwhelming feeling of doom that my face was wrong, that it looked more like a cave-troll than a human, that it was awful and I was stuck with it forever. Which lasted a couple of minutes and was very distressing. But it also only happened once.

The ""That was dysphoria?"" article that gets linked a bunch sounded similar to my experience... but it also sounded very similar to depression in general, which is something I suffer from.

I'm wondering why I'm thinking about all this if I can live fine as a guy. But then I remember that a few years ago I planned on killing myself for no obvious reason, and depression's been interfering with my work a lot, so maybe I'm not living as fine as I think? Like, maybe dysphoria is causing my depression feelings and I'm just not properly connecting the feeling to the source?

I do know that the couple of times I decided not to crossdress for a few days (I didn't start crossdressing until I started thinking about this stuff and usually just do so in the evening in my room), I didn't hate wearing only guy clothes and was worried that meant I wasn't trans. Also I felt kinda down those days. Then when I put girl clothes on again I felt better and realized that I had actually felt more down on those days than I thought, and  while I still can't directly tell where that feeling came from, the correlation with only wearing guy clothes seems like solid evidence. That seems to establish that in this particular case that I can feel bad from boy stuff without it being obvious to me that the boy stuff is making me feel bad, so maybe the same is true in other ways too? I'm not sure.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Let me say first that under any circumstances I'm not saying they are not, I just want to hear what others think. 

I identify myself as a bi despite the fact my orientation strongly gravitate towards women. After all who says to identify as a bi you need to have 50/50 split. I'd say my orientation is 99% women and 1% men (it takes very specific men to turn me on). On top of that even if I would be in releationship with such a man I wouldn't be satisfied unless other woman would be present. So basically polyamorous releationship.

Here is a thing I don't understand. If I have such a super strong preference towards women I don't understand why I have need to be one. After all wouldn't it be easier to be bi-male? I would have 1000x times bigger dating pool and much easier life. If I see a cute girl my first thought is ""I want to be her"" and my second ""I want her"".

What kind of cables got crossed in my head? I would totally understand being transgender and being bi with prefererence for men or being transgender with preference for hetero releationship, but this? I don't understand. I feel like my brain has damaged area for gender/orientation and just misinterprets attraction as gender confusion. Is it possible?

I mean, doesn't it sound wierd to you to say I'm MTF and I want to have releationship with woman? I wouldn't even have a problem to have a sex with her and I feel like using my junk wouldn't be any problem (even though I would prefer something else obviously)

"I wonder about this often. I'm coming up on two years of HRT and trying to figure out what is next. I play around with the idea of going stealth in the future, but I wonder what that actually means.

I have a paper trail of my past that accumulated over the first 24 years of my life of living as a male. College transcripts. Name on old company websites. Published articles in which I was quoted and named. Maybe a half dozen or so pre-transition pictures of me that appear when my old name is Google Searched. Picture and name of me from when I was the prom king of my high school (lol) floating around out there. My name and such in umpteen million databases. I mean, someone could just search my current name or my somewhat unique last name and places I've lived and in five minutes put the whole thing together. I work with data for a living, it's *really* not that hard at all to sync up all kinds of PI. And any company I work for would have at least one HR person know, unless there is some crazy way around this.

If anyone reading this is *truly* stealth, how did you cover your tracks as much as possible? How do you duck or get around documents and conversations and interactions that may reveal some significant personal information that would lead someone to knowing you are trans? At what point did you even make the jump to stealth?

"Hi. Really not sure where to start or if I'm even in the right place but hopefully I can get some perspective. Typing from mobile, sorry for any formatting issues.

I've always identified as a straight male &amp; I've always been quite effeminate. Now in my mid 20s I've come in contact with some friends in my local music community that have shed light on some feelings I wasn't aware we quite as.. prevalent. It started with painting my nails and wearing jewelry. I felt pretty. Not just attractive but pretty, idk. I've started wearing lipstick and eyeliner and wearing women's clothes when playing shows sometimes. I feel absolutely wonderful and part of it has to due with my surroundings. Though I'm in a very conservative state, there is a small community of queer folk/trans/femme (sorry if I'm not using the correct words, all this is sort of new for me) that have fostered an environment that's encouraged me to do what I want. I've never felt this way before. I've never not cared wether people that I was queer or not. I've never felt as confident as I do when I feel like I do when I put on makeup, borrow a friends dress and paint my nails. 

This has me thinking a lot about myself personally and my effect on those around me. I've always liked women and only been with women. I've never had a problem acknowledging other men or trans women attractive. I don't really have any intention to try and date men/trans etc. But I don't want to step on people toes once they find out I'm straight. I don't know if I'm crossing a societal line because of the lack of experience with things like this. Idk if this is just a starting point to revealing feelings I'm not willing to dig up right now. I'm just confused. Is what I'm talking about common? Are there straight men who embrace their femininity in this way and don't receive a negative stigma from other trans/queer people?

"Marking this NSFW because it discusses porn....

So at one point in college my first girlfriend (now my best friend) suggested an open relationship. I went for it, not wanting to lose her. She started seeing a guy, attractive guy, African-American. I couldn't handle it so we broke up (eventually to get back together).

When we broke up, I turned to cuckold porn, especially regarding race. It became an addiction (and still porn I enjoy watching). At that time my depression reached new levels.

Looking at it now, while my ""trans"" thoughts came after this (and first manifested for a couple months freshman year of high school, only to resurface 7 years later), I can't help but think maybe these thoughts are because I'm so deeply entrenched in this porn that I've brain washed myself into thinking I'm trans because I'm less of a man.

"Hi, I'm 20 years old. I was born a female but I don't feel like this is how it was supposed to be. First off, and I know sexuality and gender identity aren't connected, I started heavily questioning my sexuality when I was around 12/13, and came out as a lesbian to my family when I was around 15/16. I immediately regretted it, but I stuck with it and still agree that I am a lesbian (I don't date, etc so it doesn't come up often), but I lean more towards bisexual, I suppose.


 My bigger issue is that I am not very comfortable as a woman (at least not all the time) but I'm not sure what I actually am. This started around the same age I started questioning my sexuality. Most of the time, I'm just *me* ,I try not to think about what gender I am--I know I have big boobs and a big ass and sometimes I like that fact while other times it makes me want to die. I wear very very little makeup, and don't often dress super girly, but I get in that mood every once in a while until people start telling me how pretty I am and it worsens my depression and I don't want to wear dresses anymore. 


I get extreme baby fever, I love kids and I want to be pregnant--it's this insane heart clenching feeling and I can see it happening one day, and then then next I just want to be a man. I still want kids, and obviously adoption and surrogacy are options but I get that feeling so strongly I'm not sure if I could actually be a man...I think that makes sense. I'm just so confused and for the past week I've sunken into another darker depression and this is at the forefront of my mind. How do you know? How do I you really really know for sure? I'm sorry if this post is messy, I have to go to work but I will come back tonight and answer any questions y'all might have. Thank you in advance. ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Hi everyone from a long time lurker!

Can someone please recommend a good therapist to visit in Berlin?
The problem is, I've known I am a trans (mtf) for quite some time. At first, I denied it, then I feared it, but the more manly I had became to look (and I had to go through hormone autoimmune sickness therapy which made me bulkier really fast) - the more disphorya was kicking in. 
I literally could not do anything about it nor seek any help, as I originally come from Russia, where such actions were downright dangerous, but now, since I've moved to Berlin I really need some help. 
I have a great supporting wife, to whom I came out fairly recently, but that support is already not enough, while disphorya gets stronger and stronger. Additionally, I most likely can't pursue an HRT, because with the way I look (not even the bulky build, but my face) I feel will never ever be passable - and that depresses me even more. 

If someone could share a contact, or suggest some alternative, please, your help would be so greatly appreciated!

"OK, a little background here. I'm a 22 year old cis guy, about to graduate college. I'm straight and have never had a girlfriend, probably due to being a quiet/solitary person in general. 

Last year I started talking to a trans girl I knew via an online forum we both used. We started talking and really clicked - we had similar personalities and interests, she's very nice, etc. For a variety of reasons (long distance being one of them) we never become more than friends, but we did develop a weird online FWB equivalent where we flirted and cybered with one another almost daily. 

My point in bringing this up is that, ever since meeting that girl, I've found that I'm suddenly *very* attracted to transgender women. My friend sent me a few pictures of her dressing up and I honestly was more attracted to her than most porn stars I've seen. When I see a girl who I know is trans (or who I think might be passing) I find it hard to stop stealing glances. 

I don't really know why this is. I'm definitely not a chaser, since I don't really do any romantic pursuing to speak of and mostly keep to myself. I don't think it's a fetish, since, as with anyone, I wouldn't let physical attraction override incompatible personalities (another trans woman from the same forum I find to be physically attractive but personally insufferable). And I don't think it's entirely sexual - I have a low sex drive to begin with and don't really care about a penis or lack thereof. 

Maybe it's a combination of physical attraction, empathy and admiration? Being trans is hard and, on a personal level, I find it really inspiring and beautiful when a trans woman can embrace who she truly is. And I like the idea of dating a girl who is trans - but less for sex, and more for support. I have a recurring romantic fantasy that involves dating a trans girl and helping her through her transition with financial and emotional support (the former of which I do not have in real life, sadly :P). 

So what do I do? Why do I feel this way?",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"A short summery of my transition history: I realized I was trans 11 months ago. I started HRT (cypro+estradiol) 10 months ago.

I had a rough couple of months in the beginning, with a 10 year relationship breaking apart (not really in the traditional way, but more in a redefining our relationship kind of way) and some pain from a disrespectful friend (11+ years friendship, we're not really friends anymore, haven't spoken since).

But apart from all that shit, I felt very liberated and came out to everyone I knew as soon as I could, and was accepted by everyone. Overall I've been very joyful and enthusiastic. I've met a new wonderful (trans) friend, and we get along really well and understand each others issues.

However, for a while now I've had this bad feeling - I can't really put it into words, because I don't think I've ever felt it before, but it's a deep sadness, emptiness, loneliness, meaninglessness, along those lines. I feel fatigued even though I exercise regularly. I've lost all interest in my old hobbies (computer programming/hacking/administration), music (guitar) and overall curiosity. And I don't really feel I have the energy to take up new ones, don't even know what they would be. I feel distant to everyone (except my new friend), like I'm not getting the deep emotional access that I crave, and it feels like my friends are distancing themself from me. I can't be alone without crying, I don't know where it's coming from - probably that bad feeling I'm trying to describe. I ate some psylocin mushrooms a week ago, to be able to introspect and get new perspectives, to get to the roots of my problem - I just cried and cried the whole trip, 5 hours of crying. Didn't really learn anything else than that the problem is more of a problem than I thought/wanted it to be.

It's not really getting any better, if anything worse, and I'm a bit afraid. I wish I knew what was wrong, so that I could handle the issue, but I have no clue. I mean, I have strong feelings, so I guess I'm not depressed. But life kind of feels a bit pointless/meaningless from time to time and it scares me.

Maybe this is just what life is like with emotions? And I'm not used to have strong emotions.

"Wow!  So unless I heard the person wrong, I ""boymode failed"" for the first time yesterday--- getting addressed as ""miss"" when ordering pizza.  Also had my 3rd laser session yesterday and feel like hair removal is trucking along fairly nicely.

So I was pretty freaking happy actually.  Feel cute, sometimes feeling a little bothered the last couple days knowing how my chin / brow grew slightly in the past couple years, lamenting I didn't start sooner, but also just totally freaking happy.

I started HRT while still questioning and then entertained doubts for a long time even after I was basically committed to transitioning.  I feel like i'm finally over those humps.

I still work in boymode--- I teach highschoolers and classroom management is enough without being public about being trans--- but i'm also feminine af in my mannerisms while teaching and often go to class with like, nail polish and women's sweaters.  So maybe my students already know i'm trans and they're fine with it and i'm not kidding anyone.

I'm also a student, and mostly out at school.  Not sure how I want to navigate things there.  It's a very very trans-friendly school and department but there's a decent chance i'll be applying to jobs as a boy when I graduate in a couple months, so I'm not sure the logistics of like, coming out and then asking for recommendations referring to a boy-self, etc.  Does anyone have any experience with things like that?

Now that I'm finished questioning and doubting myself less and less and starting to fail boymode, I probably will just come out totally (except in my classrooms where I teach) and request my new names/pronouns from everyone.  The only thing besides the job logistics is that I don't want to feel pressured to present extra feminine when I don't want to.  Or like people will give me a hard time about new names and stuff if they don't perceive my as wearing women's clothes.

"I'm a 21 year old MtF. Sorry if this is long but I'm crying and need to get some stuff off my chest.

All I've ever wanted to be was a novelist, but it doesn't pay the bills unless you're J.K. Rowling. I got really good marks in school (people thought I would be dux), so my parents have always expected me to go well academically. I studied law for a year and became massively depressed, and dropped out. Then I tried teaching for nearly two years and hated it because I'm an introvert and I don't like kids or public speaking. My parents want me to finish a degree and that they'll pay for it. I feel like telling them I'm not even worth spending the money on. I'll just fail or drop out like I've done since I finished school.

I've considered computer science but I suck at math. I've considered nursing but I have a phobia of needles and blood. Lab technician? I'm not good at science either. There's no degree that I've ever seen that I'd enjoy or be good at, unless it was an Arts degree in literature or history, and neither of them have good employment prospects unless you go into teaching.

I'm only 1 month into my transition, so I'm not even attractive enough to be a cam girl. I wouldn't even succeed at being a prostitute if I tried, that's how worthless I feel.

It's not like I care about money, I don't. But when I add up the costs of hormones, laser hair removal, electrolysis, and all of the surgeries, and the cost of living in Sydney, housing and rent prices, my qualifications and my bank account, I quickly realise that in 10 years time I'll be just as worse off as I am now unless I get a decent paying career. And I can't get a decent paying career, because apparently I just fucking suck at everything. All my siblings and cousins have decent paying jobs and are successful, moving out, buying their first house, etc.

I know my self esteem is in the gutter and I honestly don't even know what to do about it. I have nothing going for me, and absolutely no idea what to do. I feel like a burden on everyone around me, especially my parents. I don't know what to do. :(",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"Yesterday I forced a confrontation with my mom, probably not the best idea, but I was tired of her running away from the issue. 

I can live with the, 'you are making the biggest mistake of your life' thing because she doesn't understand this yet. She also doesn't understand how I can't just go back to how I was, how now that I'm out I'm pushing things so 'fast' (she has seen the last month, I've seen this for the last 8-10 years minimum..) because for the first time in a long time I see hope. I was unsure at first,but I cannot give this up, which is something I've made clear.

Despite all of this it is clear my 'choice' is tearing her apart. She outright told me she sees her son as dead. Again, something I expected given the stages of grief. But I wasn't ready for the rest. I asked her, 'is it truly so bad to have a daughter?' to which she responds, 'No. I've just had 25 years with a son. Now I see some girl I don't understand at all. So many small things have changed.' How am I supposed to answer that? 

Or this, 'I expected you to bring a girl home, and eventually have kids. Now you are going to be some girl who can't have kids (I can't afford freezing sperm, and I don't want kids at all) who brings other girls home and lives an alternative lifestyle.' To which I ask her again, 'is being a lesbian that bad? This is what I've wanted for years. Its why I couldn't date and a huge part of why I kept myself inside.' She had no answer for me.

I'm the same person I've always been and I'm just dropping the act I've had on a lot of things. I can't maintain the 'cool' in control guy anymore where I bury emotions. That almost killed me. Now I'm trying to use my heart and my head. I probably seem a lot more impulsive then I used to be, but everything I do because I've thought it through. Initially we agreed I would put off HRT for 3 months, one month ago. 

I couldn't do it. Every single day I thought about the pills I had, and how I can't start. It almost put me back to the dysphoria wave I had at Christmas. So I had to. What else am I supposed to do? Go back to being a dead husk inside for 2 more months, when huge changes won't happen anyways?

I love my mom more then anyone else in this world, and she clearly loves me. But at the same time I don't know what to do. I can't go back, I've made that clear. At the same time I want to help her. But she is pushing me away because I've tried to help her understand better.

"I came out to my wife as transgender and going ahead with HRT and she surprised me. I expected to get told to leave and a time frame in which to do it. This fear was based on a coming out 16 years ago where I told her I was a crosdresser and also thought I wanted to transition. Well back then she set a don't ask don't tell policy for crossdressing and a divorce for anything along the transition lines. I told her I really just wanted boobs to fill out my girl clothes and she practically yelled at me for bringing it up since she made it clear what would happen.

Well I held out for 13 years trying to repress my feelings and fulfilling my role as the Man of the House. That started failing as my daughters gained independence and graduated high school and college. My role as father was diminished so I had no excuses left to hold down the gender dysphoria. I became severely depressed and withdrawn. I lost all motivation for anything and hope for a happy future. This past summer I planned my suicide to look like an accident so my wife would have a bunch of money to get over the loss of my income while she and the girls picked up the pieces. Then I sought a therapist to help as a last ditch effort to save my life.

It worked but it laid out my GD as the driver for the depression and the only current cure for it is to transition. Knowing my wife's previous response I 'knew' I was going to lose her in divorce and hoped my daughters would still talk to me at least. Since I would lose it all being dead and lose a lot of my life transitioning, the fact that I could still be alive as a woman helped me put away the suicide plan.

So the other night I explained this all to my wife 'knowing' the end was coming and she amazed me. She was not happy with the suicide planning nor the transition but she realized that I have been suffering with this a long time. She also notice through the wash that something had changed over the summer (I have started wearing bras everyday) and figured it had something to do with my gender issue. She decided she valued my companionship and personality more than outward look. She said she has a hard time seeing me in a bra but her discomfort was something she could accept if I got mentally better. I told her I didn't think I'd every be mistaken for a woman but could still be happy with myself as a 'man with boobs' most of the time. She was relieved that I wasn't bent on full time woman presentation so she could still have me as a man. She also said if that changed she would rather we stay together in separate rooms and not separate lives. I am good with that since we are not very sexual beings anyway the rest really doesn't impact us. She agreed I need to do whatever I need to get myself right. She will stick by me as a best friend at the very least and is willing to adjust however she needs to to make that happen.
So I am happy there is a future for us and that I am not losing a big part of my life due to transition. 

We have decided to keep this a secret from the rest of the family writing off my boobs as a side effect from the prostate medicine I am on (a real side effect that I am not experiencing but they don't have to know that.) We will be truthful to the daughters in the summer as they live elsewhere and really will not see any changes until then. We will explain to them what is really going on with me and advise them to use the prostate story when explaining my changes for simplicity in their lives.

We still have things to work out and variables to solve but we are doing it as a team. We are both transitioning together and admit there will be some awkward times ahead. There will also be great happiness to experience now that I am finally coming out of my depression. So life will be different but overall better.

She is truly my love and joy and I know how this must hurt her. I am glad our 30 year marriage has meant more to her than my physically male body. I know that when I am old and in a wheel chair she will still want to be with me and that makes me very happy.

"Hi, Just curious - Does anyone know if endocrinologists proscribe 200 mg of micronized Progesterone to trans women? The reasons why I ask is because I'm interested in increasing my dosage of Progesterone to try to increase my breast growth and to cycle it. I'm a post op trans woman. I currently self inject 20 mg of Estradiol Valerate every other week. Moreover, I take 100 mg of micronized Progesterone on a daily basis, as proscribed by my endocrinologist.  I will ask my endocrinologist if I can safely go up in my Progesterone dosage. But I wanted to find out if other trans women take 200 mg of micronized Progesterone. ",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I apologise in advance I am pretty drunk, New Years and all that jazz. So I haven't started transition and all my friends still see me as a dude but they do think I'm gay. Anyway I make a lot of suggestive comments saying things like when I have a vagina or wait a few years and I'll have boobs. My friends think I'm joking so it's all good but I'm being serious secretly. So I was walking home with my friend just now and I said will you be my friend when I'm a girl and he just lost it. He want on a massive rant about how he doesn't care if people are trans but he kept saying that it's what is between your legs is your gender and being trans is a mental illness. I tried to argue but basically he's a massive bigot and just said that I'm mentally ill basically. I was thinking about telling him I'm trans but not now definitely not now. I don't know what to do but sorry for this drunken disaster.

"I'm stumbling over myself a little here. I realized last night that I don't consider it misgendering when I am referred to with feminine (""she/her"") pronouns. (Though that doesn't exclude ""they"", which I've always been fine with ever since I came out to myself.)

I do realize that there's no right or wrong way to be trans, and that by extension there's nothing wrong with what I'm doing, but I feel like I'm the only one out there who uses feminine pronouns without actually identifying as full-on female.

2. I don't particularly like using my penis.  It works just fine, but the feeling is very much overrated and I have no urge to use it on others. I'd rather cuddle.  

3. Sex is NEVER on my mind.

My genes are really bad, too. My hairline receded pretty bad even though I am so young so no female hairline for me, I had weird eyebrows until today, now I got weird permanent make-up eyebrows that make me look disgusting, my voice is so deep that no matter how hard I try, I just barely get to a feminine voice after all the training and I have to lie on my back and can only hold it for 10 seconds, my chest is disfigured (right half is bigger and tilted outwards and this will probably make my breasts become pretty ugly, above one eye the skin is pushing over my eye 50% of the time. My jaw is monstrous, my hips will probably just grow a tiny bit (narrow hips in family).

I just don't know what to do, I just think death is the only choice. My body is disgusting, I fail at every attempt to make it better, my dreams will never come true, I have no money for surgeries and will not have it for a long time. I have a useless crush on a guy, he will never like me and that breaks my heart even more.

"First I'm sorry for the wall of text incoming. I've long been a lurker on this sub-reddit but I need to vent and get some advice.

I started HRT a little over three months ago. While that could be going better, I've also lost or in the process of losing everything.

It started when I first came out to my closest friends or at least I thought they were. They were let's just say less than accepting and have cut all ties completely. This wasn't too bad because I knew I would need to cut out the negatives but this was just the beginning.

Next came my family. I had already lost most of them long before I started transitioning but the reality of knowing that I'm no longer welcome around them anymore still hurts.

This was followed by losing my job. I held a well paying job but when I went on vacation last week, I came back to find the lock to my office changed and laid off. They even refused to allow me to collect my personal belongings. I'm still gathering information; however, it looks like it's because they were uncomfortable with me.

Next, it looks like my marriage is soon to follow. My wife said she was accepting; however, the reality is much colder as she cannot deal with the loss of the guy I was while struggling to accept the woman I am becoming. Maybe it's salvageable but most likely it's not. We'll see what the coming months have to bring but the storm clouds are gathering overhead.

While I know things will get better, it's still a lot harder than I ever realized. How do you hope and not let the darkness overwhelm you?",gender_dysphoria_disorder

I have been on HRT for 14 months now and full time for 8. I thought I pass but my parent told me people at stores and restaurants are just being nice about it which makes me question my sanity. idk what to do.

"Everyday is getting worse. I'm 17, closeted MTF


3 months ago I realized I got dysphoria.


In August/September 2016, I was so happy. My life was getting so much better. My social anxiety had been getting better, I managed to get the grades I needed to get into sixth form, I had more friends, everything so was much better.


At the same time, I discovered about being transgender, although at the time I knew for a fact I wasn't. I said one day in the distant future I might be trans, but at the time I thought I was completely cis.


Anyway, in October, everything clicked into place. I discovered I did actually have gender dysphoria. This was the start of october half-term, so I was at home all week. But I had more euphoria than dysphoria. I thought it was great I realized I was trans, and wanted to start transitioning. However, I told myself it was all a phase and it will be over soon, and thought by the start of December it would of all gone. It's the start of Janurary, and it still hasn't.



Now, I am so depressed, suicidal, and just got so much anxiety now. I struggle to talk to people I don't know that well (6 months ago I could just fine), I have no care in life anymore, I've pretty much been told they don't really want me back at sixth form for Year 13.

OK, I could transition. However, I can't afford too, my family + friends will not be supportive, and honestly I'll never be a cis-woman anyway. I'd never have this struggle if I were born female. I'd be totally different, feminine, everything would be so much better.


The thought of transitioning, all the reactions, just everything about it is just making my suicidal. I'll always be trans. I don't want to be. I just want to be a cis like all the other girls. I just think, what's the point in living like this, if I died I wouldn't be like this anyway? If I was told I'd die next week I wouldn't care.



Like, is there any point in life? We all have ambitions for the future, and let's face it, hardly anyone ends up like that. I want to be a woman, but I won't. I even doubt if I will enjoy the transition anyway. 


I literally cannot talk to anyone about this. A couple of best friends know about it, but they don't know about my dysphoric side, and I don't think they think I am being serious about being transgender anyway. Even to myself, I am not sure if I am being serious about being trans.


The only time I am not like this is when I am at school or out with friends, neither of which I have the motivation to do. On the outside, I just seem like any other 17 year old guy, and when I am out I don't really experience much dysphoria anyway. But I almost hate it when it happens, because it makes me doubt I am transgender anyway, which I hate so much.


Around November I was all like ""If I were more dysphoric I would be able to transition more comfortably"", and I kinda hoped that would happen because then I could transition into a girl more easily. Well, that came. Here I am, I'm finding it even harder to transition, I have no money to see a therapist or anyone, even so my anxiety is too much to see anyone anyway, I'm too scared to walk into the GP surgery just to get a referral.



Well, I don't see the point in living anymore. I am living my life, I don't even know who or what I am anymore. I want to be a girl, but I can't so there is literally no point in living anyway. How do I know what I want in the future? Will I be happy that I transitioned in the future or not? I have no idea. It scares me too much.

"So, yesterday, I drove down to the Travis County Courthouse from Fort Worth. I was extremely careful not to drink too much, as I was terrified of the idea of stopping in some small town in Texas to use the restroom.

I arrive early and was one of the first people to enter the courthouse. Most people were completely neutral or used my preferred pronouns without needing to ask. I was already anxious and guarded and a woman at the service desk blatantly and loudly misgendered me. I had to go to the building next door for an atm and had to walk back around the courthouse to re-enter and then down some stairs to make change.

I was tired from limited sleep and a long drive, scared, and now beginning to sweat from walking up and down stairs and the hill the courthouse was on in 3 inch heels and a light sweater which had been totally appropriate for the weather before taking my tour of everything in a mile radius just to complete a simple task.

I get my appointment for 10:45am so I can meet with the judge privately and now have nothing to do for two hours...but I don't want to have any negative interactions and just sit outside the courtroom, tired and drained. I also used the women's restroom, which, given SB6, was totally anxiety inducing. 

I finally get in the courtroom, expecting to be grilled. I don't present at work and I am just so sure this will create issues. The judge was just the most amazing woman ever. She did ask about why I couldn't present at work and I explained I was a flight attendant and dealing with the TSA daily with inconsistent documentation. 

She told me she had considered being a flight attendant and that she loves my company. She asked about my family and my choice of last name. She marked out one portion of my order, but it was pretty insignificant. She signs the order and then says...'Wait!'.

I got really nervous as the legal council who prepared my documentation had slipped in the wording to amend my birth certificate and that is super important to me with the bathroom bills in place. Sure enough, she flips to the second page and I could feel my heart sink...

Instead, she was just looking for my new name which was located on the second page of the order so she could properly congratulate me and told me I make a 'beautiful woman'. I was floored and suddenly on cloud nine.

I couldn't get to the first floor fast enough to print out copies of the order. And now I am just a few days away from having all of my documentation reflect my correct name and gender.

HE ALREADY KNEW ME BEFORE I TRANSITIONED!!!!! I was dying inside. Like yes the hormones are work, plus I had little make up when this happened.

I don't mind having to be open with them about being trans in order to be a part of the organization/camp again, but in the past (I don't know if they still are) the camp was kind of slightly religiously based, so I don't know how well me being trans would be taken.

(The lady who ran the art building was, and I think had a long term partner at the time...they might have even gotten married at one point, not sure.)

"I am 16 and my life is getting out of hand. My body and face is so disgusting that I try to avoid everything that could show my reflection. I lost all my friends except one guy and on that guy I have a crush which is just pointless, he will never like me in that way because I have had no HRT, FFS or SRS yet but probably even then he won't like me. Making new friends got impossible because the girls even hate me for my presence and nobody treats me like a girl anyway, I am getting treated like a alien.

I strive to be like the cis girls but I probably can't expect HRT together with finasteride to do enough to make my all masculine features vanish. I want to get to something like [this](http://imgur.com/a/9HqPO) but this will never be possible for me. Seeing how feminine the faces and bodies of trans at my age were even before everything just makes me frustrated. And on top all of that  I will have no money for FFS for a long long time.

"I've been attending a couple of family therapy sessions with a conventional therapist who has a couple of trans clients, but is obviously not very experienced with gender issues. I believe my parents are paying for the therapy sessions.

They were concerned that my desire for taking HRT without having a gender therapist (yet). I'm in an annoying situation where my current insurance is gatekeeping me until next year, and my dysphoria has been through the roof lately. I wanted to start HRT so that I could at least cut the brain fog and be on my way towards transition. I'm going to switch insurance when my work has open enrollment again in a couple of months. Note: Going Informed Consent to get the HRT out of pocket.

For what it's worth, I've been presenting as female full time since November, and I've been generally passing for about a month. I have no doubts about being a transwoman. I just want to get started on the physical transition.

I'd would get a gender therapist out of pocket, but the closest ones are about 30 miles away and I don't have a driver's license yet. Once I do (which will be very soon, but probably a little bit after starting HRT) then I can go out of pocket.

My family, and the therapist, are acting like if I started, I could become an emotional wreck and not have someone to help me through it. My thinking is, I can get on the HRT, continue my transition, reduce my dysphoria, and evaluate how I'm feeling. If I start to really be affected negatively by the HRT then I can just stop, wait until I have more therapy support, and continue afterwards.

I want to at least try it, and see if it's going to reduce my negative feelings and settle my mind a bit more.

Is there anything dangerous about doing this? My understanding is that the HRT is going to alleviate a lot of problems for me, and is not really that dangerous to give a trial run for a couple of weeks. I should know pretty early on if it's right for me.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"I'm trying to understand bigenderism, and by proxy, understand an aspect of own experience. As a disclaimer, I'm not looking for anybody to offer a label or figure me out; I'm asking if anybody is personally familiar (or has friends) with this dynamic and has any insight or anecdotes to share.

I'm biologically male, heterosexual, married, present masculine, yet the best way I can describe my experience is ""bigender"" (a term that's new to me). I typically identify as male, but I've had a number of times in my life (over a span of decades), where I secretly identified as female and overwhelming felt like I actually was more female than male.

When I say, overwhelming, I mean like a gasping for a drowning breath of air. If I could switch genders during these times, I would.

Then, eventually, I find my way back into my male sense of self.

The older I get, the more frequent, and less disorienting the transitions, likely due to experience. Also, over a lifetime of deep self-exploration, I think I'm coming to the conclusion that both of these are fully true. That, there's a facet of my experience that's 100% female and a facet that's 100% male, and that I can never accept myself as either/or, but only as both/and. I've tried to deny one or the other, and it always leads to dissonance, detachment, and psychological struggles.

I'm still very much on the road to understanding/accepting myself as I am. I've tried to read more about this, but, for most people, it seems gender is still very tightly tied to gender expression.

**TL;DR** I might be bigender? This has no bearing on outward expression for me. Any stories/experiences/insight?",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"I'm so sick of this bullshit I keep getting from my wife and family! (Oh yeah, warning:rant) 

I (28, AMAB) came out to my wife (26, cis-female) a few weeks ago and she immediately brought in her family to back her up in attacking me and telling me I'm confused and ruining my life and marriage for a phase. After a lot of therapy and crying I finally have her convinced that I really do need to transition.

She's set on divorce, which I don't blame her, but she's trying to erase me completely out of her life and blame me for the hardships she is going to face alone as a result of erasing me. I keep offering to help her and that we can stay friends and help her financially, but she doesn't want to.

I'm hurting and vulnerable, my life is changing at a faster pace than expected and she tells me she still loves me out one side and blames me out the other for ruining both our lives ""just to be a woman"". She doesn't want to know anything about what I will face or any steps along the way, but wants to say she loves me still.

I have been faithful, loving, supportive and honest in every way. I didn't tell her I was Transgender when we married because I was in denial, yet I get blamed for being a lying asshole by her family. They want me gone and keep insisting that I will hurt her more on the way out. It is so bad that she/they want me to leave my job (which as of right now has transgender inclusive policies) and leave the state for ""my safety"" and so they won't cross paths with me.

I tried to bring it up without outing myself as Trans to a neutral party and even they insist on me being a scumbag for hurting her and ruining her life. Somehow I don't deserve a shred of sympathy despite all the good I have done for her and her family.

I loved them all, I did so much for them, and now I just feel anger that I am the one shouldering all the hurt, blame and hang ups. I'm planning on coming out to my own family today and I fear them doing the same to me as she and her family did.

What the fuck? Do I just leave everything from my life behind, quit my job, run to another (more trans friendly) state? Do I have the right to even fight for what I want, or am I just a bad guy that lied about being a good person all my life?

"So I have this friend at school who was assigned female at birth and presented as this the first three years of secondary school. Now we are in the fourth year and he came out to me and said that he didn't feel like a boy or a girl. And I was like, okay, cool. 

And then he said that he rather wants to be called by 'he' and 'him' because those are the pronouns that people use for general 'it' words, in my language (Dutch). I find it super confusing. And I think that I'm the only person in school who he told this to. So he probably expects me to call him 'he' when talking to other people about him or calling for him. But other people will notice that and I would have to explained his situation, which I feel is defenitly not up to me.

Also he wants me to call him by his new genderneutral name. But again I'm one of the few people he told. And again I don't want to explain his situation to other people. So a lot of times I just call him by his old name and old pronouns at school. He also never corrects me and so I don't know of he is still in it.

"Hi everyone ~&lt;3

After a long time, I finally gave myself permission a couple of months ago to start wearing makeup while going out. That, incidentally (and perhaps, obviously) coincided with me starting to live full-time as myself. And had gone great. Didn't saw people noticing nor making comments, and I was getting properly gendered constantly.

That is, till I travel back to the States.

I don't think I'm particularly getting misgendered here (got only one ""sir"") but I do think maybe I'm not passing or people are not sure how to react to me (like cashiers saying ""Have.. nice.. evening""). Perhaps there are some cultural gender cues I'm missing, or my voice sounds different speaking English or a combination of those and other factors. Or perhaps it's all my imagination and people are just focused on other stuff. But still, it does feel different to my previous months.

Instead of feeling down on that, however, I decided to refocus those energies in taking more care of my presentation. Perhaps since I present as a kinda tomboy-femme isn't helping, and though I don't plan in changing how I want to look (that's why I'm transitioning after all), I do think that I'd helped me to learn more stuff in case I ever want to used them. 

One of those things is, then, makeup. Like I mentioned, it was a process (kinda long) of me trying things and adding them to my routine. From using only foundation plus corrector, to then adding eyeliner, eye shadows, and other stuff. And though I believe I feel ready to try more, I do lack the knowledge to see what fits me better or how to apply other things. 

I've been checking out YouTube tutorials with my girlfriend (she also didn't have a lot of skills, but have picked up a lot since), but though pretty helpful, I'd really wish to have someone along side that would take a look at me, notice my features, and help me find out what works better for my type or eyes, or perhaps another way to style my hair that would help me get the kind of look I'm going for.

Do that kind of services exist? Do they in the Boston area? Ideally, it'd be someone that can do house appointments and block a couple of hours for that, but I think I could also go to some place as long as it's private (I don't see myself ready to try those public makeovers they offer in Mac or Sephora).

Would love to get some ideas that would help me jump this hurdle and keep on learning.

"I was overjoyed when the military let us come out and seek transition.  I have been fighting the gauntlet for months trying to get everything started, desperate not to cut my hair again.  And I finally just got it long enough to look feminine.... at last I don't need a wig.  
  
But today I got bad news.  Despite it being recommended by my doctors, and even the special trans council the military appointed to be authorities in this matter.... despite the fact that I am approved to transition... my request to stop adhering to male standards has been denied (by whoever at the Pentagon they appointed to make such decisions).    
  
Apparently, such exceptions are only going to be granted at the ""late stages of a transition where the person's desired gender characteristics have become apparent."" (Their words). Part of this transition is expected to be 'real life experience', but they mandate that happen during *off-duty* time, and since on-duty time isn't expected to be part of transition.... no exception-to-policies granted.   
  
You are expected to present 100% male until such time that you have magically transitioned completely (or at least a panel of grubby military men decide you are feminine enough), at which point they will consider allowing you to grow your hair.  
  
I am despondent.  There are no appeals, and no one can help me.  The hormones have already begun doing their thing.... I mean.... I have small breast buds already.... my face is losing masculinity at an alarming rate (I had my first casual male-fail the other day).  I don't even feel comfortable in the men's room anymore.  
  
And yet I'm supposed to cut all my hair off and return to work this week presenting male.  ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½  
  
Everyone cheered for how progressive the military was being by allowing trans people to come out of the closet.  **What they have actually done is give us permission to out ourselves, so we can be exposed to a sick and inhumane gauntlet of rules, regulations, and judgement that still prevent us from being ourselves.... except now they have conveniently  identified us.**  
  
This has been the most emotionally excruciating experience of my life, and it is happening right as I am experiencing the emotional tsunami of estrogen for the first time.  It is no wonder that most trans people I talk to in the military aren't at all jubilant.... we are beaten down and hurting by a system which won't help us and is clogged by a thousand disagreeing parts.  
  
I had hoped to lead the way for trans people to proudly serve openly in the military.... but I don't think I can do this anymore.  Months spent trying to prove who I am, only to be told it doesn't matter.  Transition in silence and suffer in silence too, is the apparent direction they want us to take.  
  
I won't.  I've been laying on the floor crying for hours.  At least my contract is up in June; I'm only sorry for the trans members still stuck in this nightmare.  I just wish I had known how much the military wasn't going to support me before I decided to come out.... I would have just done it myself and not even bothered.  ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Okay so this is kind've a weird topic but going by the napkin math about 1/2 of all tall women (&gt;6 feet) are trans. Whether this is an issue or not I don't know.

By the way, I assume here that being trans is not affected by height. So, in the US there are ~160 million women. Of those, about 272,000 are above 6 feet. In the US there are also about 160 million men. Of them, about 28,480,000 are above 6 feet.

"**(Sorry if this title is misleading, this thread is mostly about porn, sorry.)**

That (title) said, until I discovered transporn, I wanted to be a girl all the time. Oh the humanity!

The point I'm getting at is that the uninformed mind can rationalize anything. Those performers were an acceptable compromise which gave comfort to my suffering.

Unfortunately, today when I found myself watching such material for the first time in 6 months, I realized that before I self-identified as trans I had not viewed the pre-op performers as their desired gender (although to be fair transporn does not spend any time stating the gender of the performers), and in the case of transwomen in porn, I only viewed them as ""*not-men* wot had what I wanted"". 

Within days of identifying internally as trans, *that* porn became abhorrent to me, and I finally understand why.


It's because until that time I saw the performers as an acceptable compromise between wanting to be female and wanting to be not-male - which I rationalized as making me not trans [because I didn't know about non-binary at the time]. I've been on E for less than a month and I'm starting to wonder whether this rationalization has tainted how I feel about my gender identity. 

I spent so much time wanting to be something which I though it was acceptable for a cis person to want but which I viewed as *neither male nor female* because I didn't view pre-op transwomen (in porn) as binary (And **at the time I thought everyone watching transporn wanted to be those performers :S, I couldn't figure out why that porn existed except to satisfy people like me**). 

Could I actually be binary (rhetorical). And if that's the case I wonder how long it will take to break through my conditioning. I certainly don't feel binary - aw man this E is really screwing with my perfect reality.


[disclaimer] Before my change in identity as far as nonfictional transgender people were concerned I didn't give much thought to their genitals. I lived in a enlightened albeit black and white world where if a person said they were a gender and looked that gender that was enough for me.",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"Hi! Audrey (mtf/INFP/she/they) here and I just thought I would write my thoughts out to help me analyze what's going on in my head. DISCLAIMER: THIS POST IS VERY LONG! I tried to make subheadings to make it more organized.

**Dealing w/ Depression Today**

I have spiraled down into a deep depression that I can't seem to pull myself out of which can be a double-edged sword, because when I'm feeling depressed I feel even worse that I can't just ""snap out of it"". Everything seems like it requires so much energy that I've significantly stopped a lot of my day-to-day activities: cooking, going to the gym, meditating, etc. I just get up, go to work and sleep because I'm severely mentally exhausted.

**Eating Disorder Relapse**

I've also recently relapsed on my eating disorder to help cope with my depression. (I've lost almost 100 pounds after I stopped binge eating 2 years ago when I chose to start eating healthy and exercise regularly. I finally felt like my relationship with food was healthy!) But now, I literally do NOT give a shit! Chocolate for breakfast? Sure! Oreo McFlurry for dinner? Sounds AMAZING! And it's not just what I'm eating, it's the amount as well. I never feel satisfied when I eat...so I eat and eat &amp; eat until I feel sick and I hate myself for it. 

**Tsunami Dreams**

My dreams have also been different lately. Almost every night this week, I've dreamt about a Tsunami approaching (I live off of the coast) and in the dream, I'm trying to strategize with my family to find refuge and to travel as far inland as possible, to avoid the disaster that we know is coming. 

This dream is a classic interpretation that my emotions/feelings/issues are rising to the surface and right now it feels like I'm running from them, instead of facing them. So what am I'm running from? I want to try to dissect that by looking to the past. 

**My Childhood**

My parents divorced when my twin sister and I were two so we were primarily raised by my Father's Grandmother and my religious, Fundamentalist Christian Mother. My Father was never physically or emotionally available. However, my Grandmother and Mother were strong women who I love and respect dearly to this day, but I would watch the light leave their eyes when their spouses drank and abused them. 

I idolized and envied my twin sister. I wanted to grow up and be just like her! We would ALWAYS play with Barbie dolls together and I would love dressing up in her clothes. We shared similar friends since I identified mostly with other girls; It just made sense.

That was an amazing experience when we were kids, but when we grew older, she started getting angry with me because of how attached/codependent I was with her and treated me poorly in Middle School and Highschool for it. I felt lost, because to some extent, she was the only person who didn't care that I was different, so why was she distancing herself all of a sudden?

Growing up, I remember being the happiest child and was fabulous in that I was always doing what I loved...until puberty hit and I realized that I was AMAB and stuck in my body. When I realized I was different, I immediately hated myself for it. 

Although I was never physically abused, verbal abuse is real and that's when my eating disorder/self-harm started. I ate my feelings to help deal with my unstable environment and the hateful words from my Grandfather, Step-Dad and sometimes from my Mother, who would condemn me every so often for identifying as bisexual. I started cutting myself in Middle School and that's when my parents sent me to my school's counselor. However, I never opened up and felt guilty for even having to see a counselor in the first place. All I wanted was just to be myself and not get reprimanded for it from my family and the rest of the world. I told the counselor everything was ""fine"".

**Dating in Middle/High School**

I came out as bisexual in high school, but before that, I exclusively only dated girls. I had a couple of sexual encounters with boys, but never a successful relationship. 

**Getting Married**

There was one special girl that I fell in love with that I met at my home church when I was volunteering on the worship band. (I loved playing the piano and singing back then but I haven't played an instrument since I left the church). We dated Junior &amp; Senior year and I ended up marrying her after high school. Thatâ€™s what heterosexual Christian men do, right?

We really became one in our relationship, however, we were awfully codependent and she constantly put me down anytime I would act feminine and was very transphobic. All of our friends witnessed the verbal abuse but usually said nothing. To me, I was used to it, HELL, even enjoyed it. Negative attention is still attention, right? One could probably say it's all I knew growing, so it makes sense why I attached myself to a strong, opinionated woman who knew how to control and manipulate me. 

My wife at the time knew I was bisexual and was attracted to men, but our religion made us blind to the real truth. She chose to love me besides my attraction...or maybe she chose to ignore it. We were married for a year and a half before I came out to her as gay and ended the marriage in divorce.

I wonder if she ever knew that I dressed up in her clothes and wore her makeup while she was at work...

**Coming Out To My Family**

Ever since my divorce (almost three years ago), I've been in therapy with an amazing therapist. In the last three months, I experienced my ""awakening"" and I came out to my immediate family and close friends as Trans. My mother could not be more than loving, supportive and has removed herself from the church, my Father doesn't understand, and the siblings that I've come out to love and support me for who I am.

I couldn't be more than happier that my immediate family and close friends are supportive, but sometimes I feel like I, MYSELF, am still having a hard time accepting myself as trans. Does that make sense?

I've been living a lie for so long, have encountered a lot of codependent abuse and now I'm able to live my truth, but sometimes the truth is dreadfully painful. 

However, it's liberating to be living my truth and I would rather live my life authentically than living in a Christian heteronormative box!

I've been living in that box for far too long and know how damaging it can be.

**Spiritual Awakening &amp; Reading**

Today, I have discarded my fundamentalist Christian ways and believe in many things spiritually. I don't worship one god, but am open to exploring different truths. I believe in my spirit guides and karma. I had a reading done this last October by an awesome teacher/psychic/friend who said I have issues with perfectionism, which is spot on because before I came out as a trans woman, I was identifying as a gay male and everything in my life had to be perfect; the clothes I wore, the food I ate, the conversations I had, and my job. Once I came out, I looked at myself and realized I was really Pansexual. Just kidding (sorta lol). I realized that my male self was all a facade, a veil that I was using to hide my real, authentic self.

**Closing Thoughts**

That's my story so far and I feel better that I was able to release it because even though I've been through a lot emotionally, the one thing I'm sure of is that I'm still here, adapting and changing the things in my life that I'm no longer happy with and I will get through this! Healing takes time and sometimes I don't even want to accept it, but if I want to move forward, accepting and loving myself is the first step.

**I would love to hear your thoughts if any:**
**What helped you deal with childhood abuse?**
**How did you overcome your depression or an eating disorder?**
**What have you done to increase your sense of self?**
**How are YOU doing? :)**

Until next time, thank you for letting me share!
Love you all!

"To start off with, I have an anxiety disorder ^among ^other ^things. I'm questioning my gender, and I have things I want to try out and explore but my anxiety gets so bad that I feel very uncomfortable and unable to try them or I criticize my ""performance"". (Sorry, I'm struggling to find words)

I have figured out part of my discomfort with doing these is because I don't read as anything other than ""female"" so I have anxiety about being ""found out"" -- for example giving a name at Starbucks or wearing a binder/packer. I was also terrified to cut my hair but I finally did it on a whim after all these years. The problem for me is that I don't know how I can see if I'm trans if my anxiety flares up so bad. It's not only stressful to go through, but also very difficult to tell how the experiment made me feel about my gender because all I could feel was the anxiety. And part of being anxious means analyzing every little thing, thinking others constantly perceive you negatively, dreading what may happen, and being so mortified by some look/word/action that you avoid doing it again. Anyone have tips to navigate questioning yourself while living with mental illness?",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Yo, everyone. I've contemplated posting here for many many months, but I've reached a point where I need to communicate about my issues with people who actually understand what I'm going through.

HRT. It's a fickle thing, and at 16 with one non- supportive dad (believes in trans people being a 'fad' and 'untrue' and a household with very little income I'm terrified of never being able to transition. The most I've done in years since coming out to my mom is grow my hair out.

And, even if I do manage to start transitioning, I'm again terrified of it working. Even as from a cis male standpoint I feel hideous, fat, and freakish. And from a trans standpoint?

All I'll say is: I'm lucky to go a day without being legitimately scared of my own reflection. I've got a fat, wide, jutting, ethnic nose, sagging cheeks, laugh lines and eyelids (especially my right due to its non functioning), a hideously large forehead and ears that would make Grunkle Stan jealous.

Not to mention my sasqurtch- esque body hair, fat belly (even with 3- 4 days of exercise per week and healthy food ...), lumberjack length shoulders, and oars for hands and feet.

I've had friends call me ugly and only family members and therapists call me pretty/handsome/whatever among other things. I see very little hope of transitioning, much less passing, and even with antidepressants, good friends, a well meaning (though misunderstanding) mom, and bi- weekly therapy visits, I still feel depressed and suicidal every day.

"When I was 15 years old I realized that I wanted to be a woman more than I wanted to be a man, but being immersed in a very strict conservative culture I hid it and suppressed it. For 20 years I told myself it was just a phase of puberty, a teen boy exploring his sexuality.

In the last year I've become increasingly despondent about my life. I kept having this nagging feeling that something was out of place, that my life had gone in the wrong direction somehow and I was meant to be doing something else. My wife noticed it and started probing me to find out what was going on in my head, and I started having this nagging suspicion of what might be wrong.

On Monday I discovered /u/jackmolay's fantastic crossdreaming blog, and for the first time in my life I came to understand that what I had been feeling for so long wasn't just a phase or a fetish, but a side of me that I desperately needed in my life.

I slept horribly Monday night, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Tuesday morning I found this subreddit and all you wonderful people. I spent the entire day reading personal accounts, both happy and sad. Stories of tragedy, joy, and self discovery. Finally I found /u/transientavian's [list of simple little pleasures](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3wfkzh/lets_be_positive_what_mid_to_post_transition/) that she had found mid and post-transition. I messaged her to give my thanks and we had a small conversation about the post. This was the tipping point, it was that conversation that made me realize I had to do this. That evening I went out to pick up takeout and blasted my favorite Green Day album in the car. I rocked out, sang at the top of my lungs, and felt like a million dollars. I came home positively giddy with excitement. My wife commented on how suddenly vibrant and joyful I seemed.

I didn't get a single wink of sleep Tuesday night. Not one bit. I spent the whole night exploring my memories, recalling things I had forgotten or deliberately repressed, like how I would wear spandex leggings under my clothes when I went to school (it was the 90s, don't judge!), and how I had stolen clothes from my mother's dresser and would wear them around the house when she was out of town. I imagined coming out to friends and family, replayed a fictional conversation with my wife over and over again.

I was a disaster Wednesday morning and finally crashed at 8am and slept for two hours. I told my wife it was because of all the iced tea I drank the night before (which was true, it absolutely didn't help). All day I stressed about broaching the topic with my wife. We had discussed last week that I should probably see a therapist, but of course she didn't mean _that_ kind of therapist. I knew that I _had_ to tell her what I was going to do, and I was 90% certain that she would be supportive, but she's 31 weeks into the pregnancy from hell and I was terrified to put any more strain on her, emotionally.

I messaged a trans friend of mine on twitter, laid everything out, and asked her what I should do. She told me that realistically if it was going to work out, it would work out whether I told her now or told her later. Last night before bed my wife and I took a shower together. For five whole minutes I stood there nearly silent, wrestling with myself. Finally I said it.

&gt; ""I think I need to see a gender therapist.""

&gt; ""Oh, ok. Good""

She didn't even bat an eye. No pause, no strong reaction. I thought she didn't get it.

&gt; ""You do understand the implication of that, right?""

&gt; ""Yes, but I want you to be happy, and I'll love you no matter what you decide.""

I was floored. I wanted to cry. She _did_ cry. She is 100% behind me and supports whatever course my therapist and I decide to take. We talked in bed for three hours about my past, my present, and our future. I told her _everything_. We both laid out all our hopes and concerns and vowed that we'll take all of this one day at a time and both do our best to help each other through whatever comes our way.

Then this morning came the icing on the cake. I have struggled with obesity my entire life, never able to find a goal that overwhelmed my desire to enjoy food. Every diet I've tried has failed because, at the end of the day, I enjoyed eating more than I cared about my body. The instant I knew I wanted to transition, I found my goal. I finally have a body image that I want badly enough to stop over eating. I tracked what I ate yesterday and realized I only consumed 880 calories (it was easy, I was too worked up to eat). Before my shower this morning I stood on the scale and discovered I've lost 8 pounds since last week.

Ladies and gents, I am on top of the fucking world this morning. I want to dance on rooftops and sing to the stars. I want to shout it to the skies.

I am a trans woman, and I finally know my place in the world.",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"For those who don't know, last night the US Republican Senate voted 51 - 48 on the following: 

1. End coverage for preexisting conditions, veterans benefits, and aid to rural hospitals.
2. Remove discrimination protection for women in healthcare.
3. Against provision allowing children to remain on parent's insurance till the age of 26.
4. Cut funding for the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
5. Against ACA contraceptive coverage and maternity care provision.
6. Direct committees to send budget legislation to defund and repeal the Affordable Care Act.
House votes on Friday.

For those who get health insurance through work, no pre-existing conditions and lifetime caps for coverage are back for everyone.

I have health coverage through work, and have been on the phone with my provider to find out how this will affect transgender health care, and when it might take affect if it does, but haven't received any answers. 

I'm scheduled for vaginoplasty in February, and a follow-up surgery of labiaplasty in May. I'm wondering if this is potentially in jeopardy now. Does anyone know if gender dysphoria is considered a pre-existing medical condition?

Update: ""Last night senate Democrats inserted their own amendments to proactively protect coverage for people with preexisting conditions and adult children covered by their parents. These amendments were struck down, largely on the argument that they were not budget items and therefore did not qualify. THIS WAS NOT a vote against these provisions, it was a vote against protecting the provisions. Yes, this gets senate Republicans on record as being very shitty people, but it does not repeal these important provisions.""

https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5nni4l/when_i_am_alone_i_feel_mtf_when_im_in_public_im/) when I didn't feel that trans. 


My dysphoria is so bad right now, it's gotten from bearly noticeable to so bad in just over an hour. I just watched some YouTube videos about some trans girls, I just got my phone and threw it across my room. Knowing they can do things about it and I can't fucks with my mind so much. 


I fucking hate everything. On that post I said in an hour my dysphoria would be worse, and I was right. 



Literally, reading this sub, seeing people who are getting hrt, transitioning, etc.  Just makes me feel so much worse, knowing I can't. I have no money, the time I'll be able to get HRT on the NHS I will probably be dead anyway. I were born female I'd never have this. 


I honestly see no point in living. Day in, day out all I'm doing is just wondering if I'm trans or not, everytime I think I'm not trans I get so frustrated. I've had this everyday for the past 3 months. Before that life was so much better, everything was getting better, I had more friends, I just felt do much better with everything. I was less anxious. Now since going on this sub I'm not the reverse, I'm depressed, sometimes suicidal, and so anxious about everything. I'm close to being expelled, I don't even care. 


I got school tomorrow, my dysphoria will get better but I'll just have more denial, which just makes everything worse for me. It's preventing me from doing anything about it.

"Hello everyone I am making this on a throw away account. I really need help. 
I am in my early 30s and i am mtf. I have had these feeling since I was around 10 years old. I have tried my best to overcome them by mostly by trying to bury them but that did not work. About 3 years ago I reached my breaking point and had to do something so I finally started seeing a therapist.  I have been seeing my therapist now for about a year and in that time I have made some small steps the biggest being I told my Aunt and mother (that went OK while they aren't supportive they didn't disown me either) also started to buy more clothing makeup etc. 

Now to where I currently find myself. After all I've done so far my therapist believes the next step for me is Hrt. The only thing is whenever I think about this a fear and an unwillingness to do it takes over. I read so many stories of people starting Hrt and they are excited to start. whenever I think about taken the pills I get really scared. This is the next step and yet I am frozen in place. I think some of this fear can be coming from the fact I don't want to be known\seen as someone who is transgender. passing to me at least is so very important. It's not something I can just get over yet I know I won't pass (big hands, feet, ears, etc.).But if I continue to live as I have been for the past 20something years the depression will win and I would be able to act on the suicidal thoughts.

I suffer everyday and the depression is so bad I don't want to even leave my house. Don't want to transition but don't want to keep suffering living as a man. I feel like I lost a rigged game that I never wanted to play. I feel so hopeless like I should just learn to embrace the depression. Get use to the fact that all I will feel though the remainder of my life is sadness, anger, and anxiety never knowing what ture happiness feels like. How do I overcome this if there is even a way to.

"I think if I just try to avoid anything transgender related, I could probably live as male fine. 



I was fine crossdressing until I discovered about gender dysphoria. It was amazing... Being a guy who wants to be a girl and transitioning seemed amazing, like I kinda wished I had it, weirdly enough. 



But the more I read, I actually started having some dysphoric thoughts. They where very mild, but it was somewhat there. But as time moved on, they got worse and worse, and I'm now depressed and even suicidal over this, I'm the space of 3 months. 



I used to want to be more trans so I would be more happy about transitioning, but instead of feeling more trans, I've had more dysphoria which has not helped at all.



The dysphoria generally has to be triggered, or I have to be reminded of it. Often, for the first 30 seconds or so I completely forget about dysphoria until the thought comes into my head. If I see a girl (often attractive) it will trigger it. 



If I see a girl, I'll ask myself ""do I want to be like her"" and I'll say no. Then I'll see a boy and ask myself the same question, and it will definitely be ""no"". Then I look at the girl again and ask myself again, and then I'll be ""not sure"". 



I often trigger the dysphoria because it makes me slightly better wanting to be a girl. The thoughts are almost comforting. I'm scared if the dysphoria will go away, because that will mean I'll be male for the rest of my life. The thought of being male my entire life scares me and not knowing what it will be like to be female scares me. 



When the dysphoria is hardly there, I feel worse because I don't really care about transitioning, and I hate the feeling. When the dysphoria is there, but not too bad is when I feel the best. When the dysphoria is not there or really bad is when I feel the worse. ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Alright this is it, things have gotten so bad that I need to seek help from you guys. I don't know how to deal with my psycho Mom.

She's a horrible Mother first and foremost. Since young she has been verbally and non verbally abusing my Sister because she hates having a Daughter. Therefore me obviously being AMAB I did not receive such horrible treatment from her growing up.

I have to reiterate that she's a horrible woman. She mistreats my paternal Grandmother and I can't stand watching that growing up. I would always end up throwing a fit to protect my Grandmother whenever I saw this. She has got no respect for anybody else.

Ever since I've came out and been on HRT, her target has changed. Now I'm being abused and her attitude towards my Sister has changed for the better. She straight up told me in the face that I'm no longer her child should I transition, that I have no use for this family since I won't be having a kid in the future and I can't carry on the family line. Originally they were gonna leave the inheritance to me (because I'm the Son). Now they are going to leave nothing for me  (well fine by me). 

But the amount of abuse that she's giving me is so immense. I can't say that I'm taking it well. In fact I think I'm almost going crazy. Having to witness her mistreating my Grandmother even up till today and on top of that, I have to deal with it myself! 

My Dad's the nicest dude in the world and honestly I feel bad that he got himself such a deranged Wife. Absolutely nothing short of a lunatic. My dad is okay with me transitioning but not my mum. I have to hide my female clothes and my appearance is already giving things away. Soon I'm going to change my legal name and I'm sure that's going to evoke some reaction in her. In fact I just talked to him about her today and he just told me to ""try to present well and not enrage her and you should be fine"". But even taking a rest after working straight for 9 days had her chiding me with words coming out like ""sleeping all day such a useless person"" can she just go  and die already? 

Can't believe things took a BIG change. My psychopath Mother being SUPER nice to my Sister and being a depraved person towards me. Oh well.

"OK. I have doubts if I am actually having dysphoria, or if I've managed to trick myself into thinking I have it. 



If you go back to when I was 12/13, I was a completely straight cis guy who just happened to like wearing girls clothes in private. But no dysphoria whatsoever. I had a little desire to be a girl, but that's only because I liked their clothes more than guys clothes, but it didn't bother me at all. 


But at the same I was an incredibly horny teen back then, I'd watch a lot of porn (although so do a lot of 13 year old boys) , I would dream about having sex pretty much all the time, I had crushes on girls in my year, but I didn't have any dysphoria. 



Fast forward to last year, I had this crush on this girl in my year who I was quite friendly with. I really wanted to ask her out, but I have quite bad anxiety so I never did ask her out. 



Then in September I discovered what being transgender meant, and what gender dysphoria what. I said to myself that being trans is something I might be in the future, but I just said that I'm cis, and ignored it. 


But then I came across ""That was Dysphoria"", I read it and oh my God, it was like reading my own biography. When puberty I became depressed, I hated life, didn't care about anything, but I was really odd. I had no friends but I was like the trouble maker in the class, was quite dramatic, but at the same time was the loner. I knew I was very different from everyone else, but never knew why I was that way. 



But it's only been the past few months I've had dysphoric thoughts, it's pretty much came out of the blue. But now, I'm more depressed, I sleep all day, I don't care about grades or anything, I don't bother seeing friends anymore, instead I'll stay at home or go on this sub. 




It's like, why have I been fine for years, but suddenly I'm not? Why has it come out of the blue without any sort of trigger? It all seems a bit suspicious to me, like I'm making it up or just hoping I am trans. ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Hello! I am a portrait photographer and I am interested in entering (creating?) the niche market of coming out portraits for trans people.  In my work, it is my job to pose my clients so they look their best. I guide the women to flattering feminine poses, and the men to strong, masculine poses. There is a lot of nuance that the average person doesn't consider--hand position and placement, how the spine is curved, how the weight is distributed, etc. I often see photos of trans people where they are not posed well and it upsets me because I know I could have done a better job. The portrait session would have the same pricing as my other sessions but I would like to donate 10% to an organization that helps the trans community. My questions are:

1 - Do you think a coming out portrait session would be of interest in general to trans people?
1a - Is ""coming out"" the right way to describe the session?
2 - Do there tend to be local trans communities and if so, how could I find them? I would like to reach out to them since my clients would need to be local. I am in NJ if that helps. 
3 - Are there any pitfalls I am missing as a cis-gendered person? The very last thing I would ever want to do is cause offense or hurt to someone. 
4 - What are reputable organizations I can donate to?

Thank you for your time!

Edit: Thank you all so much for the thoughtful feedback. I really appreciate it because many of you brought up concerns that had never crossed my mind. I really learned quite a lot. 

I now understand that the coming out phase is a painful and difficult one, and that people are generally not happy with how they look. If these portraits were to happen, it should happen once they feel they are comfortably passing, and as someone wrote, would be better called â€œgender-affirming portrait sessions.â€

I understand there is an important difference between trying to cater to LGBT people and just making it apparent on my website that I am LGBT friendly. My hope with these sessions, if I go forward with trying to do them, is that people would know I am aware of and sensitive to issues that are specific to people in the trans community. This thread has gone a very long way toward making me aware of those issues, and I am deeply grateful for that.

Some people brought up the idea of being supportive to the trans community simply by donating a small percentage from jobs I am already doing, or by volunteering to do portraits for free. I like both of those ideas very much. Maybe I can hook up with a local support center and offer a free service through them. I doubt Iâ€™ll be overwhelmed with requests, so it shouldnâ€™t be too difficult to schedule the sessions in. This is something I genuinely want to do to help people feel good about themselves.

Thank you again for all of the thoughtful replies and feedback.",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I'm trying to get my head around being cisgender.


Like, living as you assigned gender for life, without ever being curious about being the opposite gender or wanting to be it?



I always thought I was cisgender until I was 16. Between 13-16 I thought ""I'd rather be female, but being male is fine"". Although I think it was purely because I crossdressed in private and I just wanted to be able to wear the clothes in public and not look strange.


Whereas the clothes part is still there for me, I'd rather of been born female because I would of never known what it was like being male in the first place. I'd rather be a cis woman than a cis man.




Does anyone else think it's just so strange being cis? Like, never ever thinking about it, or rather being like someone who is female or anything? It's so weird for me

"I've grappled with this for the past 10 years. I think I have what some would call an Alpha personality - I am a go-getter type, I started a bunch of businesses, own a bunch of real estate, have aspirations of running for office and being a billionaire (I can dream, right). At the SAME time, I've had trans feelings.

I've tried low-dose HRT but I felt ... weaker on it ... like, personality wise ... from one side, I wanted to look like a woman, from another, I want the male strength to power through things.

I feel that TRANSITION (not being female) would adversely affect my aspirations. Introducing my body to a bunch of drugs/pills, passing issues/etc .. all would be a hassle, although a PLEASANT hassle

I've been torn between this forever and do not have an answer. I wonder if my TRANSNESS is PART Of the reason why I find myself smarter than almost anyone I meet? I literally feel like I should've been there on the team that founded facebook or google ...

- I have always felt like I have been running away from things in life. Never felt satisfied.
- I dont know what came first. The feeling of ""never being satisfied"", orr the desire of being female. Is the female desire just another ""running-away-episode""? Or is it a fully legitimate symptom that is common among transgender people?
- I am a sensative person who's always trying to be kind. I dont like conflicts. I think this mkght be the reason of ""running away"" symptom. But I want to believe it is about my gender role. Maybd its both?

"Hi! I am Kenna and a mtf/19 transgender, HRT for 1 month. So I came out to my parents and they said all they want from me is to be happy. I am glad for that but during transitioning, they want to always come to the apartment like every 4-5 days. I NEED some alone time to transition! Like makeup, clothing, hair removal etc. I feel like this change when they see me after 5 days and I wear makeup, is too much for them to handle. Also it would be too hard for me mentally to present to them. They took my coming out like it was a dramatic soap opera and afraid they will do the same after all this.

Also, i quite like masturbation (sorry.. this is really crude), and am scared getting srs will change this experience negatively, and i will be less sensitive.

"Hi everyone. 

I'm a 20 year old trans women and I've been on estrogen for 9 months.

Around last July, I yawned and there was a sudden ""pop"" in my left ear and I felt as though my ears were ""full"", like you may experience on an airplane.

The ""full"" feeling came and went daily in both ears, and after about a month I developed very loud tinnitus in both ears. 

I started seeing an ENT who had me try nasal steroids and ear drops, which did nothing. Which made him think it's a jaw issue called TMJ - Temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Sure enough a couple weeks later I got more TMJ symptoms such as jaw pain, tight neck, and jaw ""clicking"" noises.

I saw my ENT today for a follow up and was given a hearing test and found out I've got low frequency conductive hearing loss in my right ear, about 20 decibels, which is considerable. He told me I may have otosclerosis... a condition that leads to deafness without surgery. He told me that otosclerosis is very common in pregnant women and studies have shown HRT in cis-women can worsen otosclerosis.


Any other trans ladies on estrogen have otosclerosis? I'm super depressed about this because my transition has been going so fanatically well. I don't know what I'm going to do :( ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

I've been taking 4mg Estrofem(split 2mg in the morning and 2mg at night) sublingually and 50mg cypro. I made the mistake of taking my morning dose around two hours before I was supposed to get my blood test done, but that spike still seems unnaturally high.

"(I'm not a native speaker, and I'm very tired, so please don't hang me up over bad grammar or a wanky phrase. Constructive criticism on my language is welcome, learning is good.)

I've been told that I ""completely pass"" and have a ""perfect passing"" by other trans people. I've even had it used as an argument against me, brought up when I, disappointed, literally said that I don't seem to pass. (They basically told me to stfu because in their eyes, I pass perfectly well.)

In reality, I don't pass. I'm four months on testosterone and while my voice has dropped significantly, my face looks almost exactly the same. Amongst cis men, I look and feel like [this](http://m.imgur.com/X4f1skS?r).

I only get gendered female in public and the only time I passed was when I was introduced as male to a group of people. I get ""lady"" and ""madame"" daily. It sucks. I once passed pre T when someone thought I was 13. I am, however, addressed with my preferred name and pronouns by all of my classmates and teachers, for which I'm really glad and thankful. They're great.

Now here's the thing: I think that many trans people - especially those who work with other trans people or are around them a lot - have biased opinions/impressions of the passing of others. 

I see it myself: I'm so used to addressing people with their preferred pronouns and name that I have trouble telling if someone passes or not. Mostly it's like ""yeah I guess?"", but I think in reality I think it's just my brain going ""that person is saved in the file *he/him/his* so we gender them male, alrighty?!""

I volonteer with trans youth (my age, and a bit older/younger) and many of them are not on HRT (yet). I have a really hard time saying if they pass or not because I'm so used to seeing ""feminime"" men and ""masculine"" women all the time.

What are your opinions on this theory? Have you experienced similar things?",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I keep asking myself, and I have two completely different thoughts.



* I present female, decide it's not for me, or have even more doubts about being trans, and be constantly stuck in this loop



* I don't present as female, start HRT, then I start to have permanent changes, go out as female and realize I don't actually like it.



This is why I wish I were born female. As my parents have quite strict gender roles, I would of been raised feminine, and not masculine. Sometimes I think maybe because I never got to do much feminine things as a child it has made me like this.


What would you do if you were in my situation?

"This is probably relatable for everyone here. Finally after 8,5 months of HRT, my body catches up with my mind. I failed the boymode almost completely at this point, and gave my first public speech (without showing my face) using my new voice. It's still not as good as it should, but it passes.

Last month was very hard for me, but this week was really great. Today I woke up, brushed my hair, and sat down in my bed. What i saw and felt, my longish hair on the right side of my head, breasts under my t-shirt that i sleep in, wide hips, and my amazing legs (don't judge please, i really love them).

Even looking in a mirror didn't gave my dysphoria and if it weren't for my skin problems/shadow between my upper lip and nose, Adam's apple and eyebrows, i would pass in my own eyes. I can't wait until I'll get rid of those and correct my curved septum that not only will look better, but my head will stop hurting (my brain doesn't get enough air because of that) and my voice will sound better and more neutral.

"I have a few questions about it and I am debating doing it at all. Right now, I do not want to have kids at all, and on top of that, if I were to have kids, I don't think I care if they are genetically related to me. I am perfectly fine with adopting or maybe having a future partner either find a surrogate mother or to find a sperm donor. My only thought is that my opinions on both having kids and wanting biological children may change with time, and so I am considering banking sperm as an option.

My biggest question is, how long does the process of banking sperm take, from start to finish? I have the opportunity to start HRT this Tuesday, probably. I am being given the option for banking sperm before starting, but it may delay the time that I do start HRT. I am concerned with this because I have been waiting for almost a year since my first referral to a therapist, and now I am finally at somebody who can prescribe me with HRT, and that appointment is on Tuesday. I don't want to have to wait months in order to get HRT once again just to bank sperm.

My second question is what are the costs? My parents are willing to cover any costs (within reasonable amount) for now, but when I move out and am living on my own for the first time, I may not be able to afford it.

"I've kept my depression and dysphoria hidden for as long as I could, I'm hitting severe new lows recently, without any changes or life events to blame it on, there's no concrete reason for these lows.

I think the lack of change and the lack of distractions that take me out of reality is exactly what's causing them, I have little else but suicidal thoughts, I feel like I've only liven half a life and it's time I do something about this, at 25 years old, where I already feel close to hopeless.

While I find an overwhelming amount of information on the specifics of a transition, as well as the emotional states and experiences of people before, during and after, what I seem to lack is the very start:

*(Note: Anywhere in Portugal's capital, if you can give me specifics.)*

**1. Where do I find support?**

Online communities to talk with, which are supportive - but not echo chambers, allow criticism and some uncomfortable truths -, which I could potentially become a member of, receive and try to give some help back as I go through it.

More importantly, what community do you choose, and how can I become involved in a productive way?

Additionally, where do I find any local groups and at what point should I even look for them?

**2. Where do I find a therapist?**

I've had plenty of years to understand myself, I feel that I know what I am and what I need, I'm lightly concerned to have that certainty ripped away by an uncooperative therapist and treatment forbidden, is that concern as unreasonable as it sounds to me? I'll keep an open mind, regardless.

However, where do I even find someone specialized in gender issues? My googling efforts have turned rather fruitless, not finding any specialized therapists making their services and availability clear online, and I'm lightly afraid of picking a random one, as I can't find any sources of people's experiences with most of them either.

Should I just... pick a random mental health professional and go?",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I chose to not transition a couple of years ago, and some days it becomes really hard to remember why I'm even abstaining in the first place. I remember realizing I was trans when I was a young teen, and I promised myself that once I left high school, I was going to finally become happy and identify as the gender I always wanted to be a part of. As time went on and I actually graduated, I began to realize how important my family, my girlfriend (I'm a male), and my career are to me as well, and in the end, I chose to not do so.

On days like this, I wonder to myself why do I even put up with the always looming unhappiness just so I can make those I love happy. I grew up with a single father, and we both love each other very much, but I know if I were to undergo a sex change, I would not be able to ever speak to him again. As for my girlfriend, I know that if I changed I would become unattractive to her since she's only into men and we'd be best friends at best, and I don't want that considering that she is the world to me and I'm planning on proposing to her in a few months. Meanwhile, it's also my dream to become a famous filmmaker and I'm afraid that if I were to change my appearance, people would not be able to take me seriously professionally in my career, and so I chose to not do so for that reason either. 

At this point, I'd like to hear how those of you that are also trans but are choosing to not change are doing as well. I'm hoping that maybe I'll hear something on how any of you guys are doing that will make me feel better about the last few days. My girlfriend has been a huge source of support for me since I came out to her when we first started dating, but even her kind words don't do a whole lot for me past a certain point because I know she will never truly understand how I feel. 

Is it such a weird thing to want to forgo something that would be integral to my happiness just for the sake of those I love and my art? The latter makes me happy too, but it's like there's always this huge elephant in the room for me lately and it eats me up inside. Hell, even if I decided to change, there's no guarantee I'll walk out the other end as being able to pass and looking like the reasonably attractive young woman I always dreamed of being.

In the end, how do you guys move day to day with this kind of thing? Sorry if it got too drawn out with this post, but I feel like I had to get it off my chest somewhere since I know that whatever tree I'd bark up to otherwise, it'd be the wrong one.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"So, today i wanted to spend the evening as me and stop living this seemingly endless life dressed as a man.
I dressed up with some clothes i just bought recently, did my make up and everything.
And before going out, i looked at myself a last time and i was still able to see my male face behind all of this, i was a little depressed but i just remembered that during those last months i male-failed quite a few times.
I just got over my fears and finally had the courage to get out even if i already did it the past.
Everything went smoothly, i was actually finally happy that i did it and extremely enjoyed that everyone was actually seeing me as the woman i am.
The thing is that i felt so insecure mainly because i don't own a car and i need to use public transportation to move around the city. I was constantly afraid and paranoid that someone will recognize that i am transgender and insults me or worse attack me even though everything went fine i was constantly scared.
When i got back home i hated the fact that i was scared and paranoid, i just see now how easy life is when i'm dressed as a man that i started questioning again if i really want live as a woman.
I don't wanna live the rest of my life scared and in constant fear even though it cures dysphoria.
I feel so selfish that i choose to transition over my parents that raised me hoping that i will become a successful man.
Transitioning actually did not bring me any happiness but instead only sadness and i lost everything i had (Family, Friends) and i don't know how it will turn up in the future and i am just wondering now why would someone go through what i call hell (Hormones - FFS or FMS - Other surgeries - SRS) when they had it easier as their assigned gender. I know dysphoria sucks but why.
I am thinking of stopping hormones even though i can't do it. I really want to continue my transition but i feel so low now.

"I think I should give some context to explain what I mean. I started going full time about two weeks ago despite still waiting to start with hrt. Generally it has made me so much happier, but then there are the bad times.

Yesterday I went to a MAC and had my makeup done professionally. I am lucky enough to have a rather androgynous body and already having very feminine mannerisms and voice. We went out for dinner last night and I was wearing a dress in public for the first time. To my own huge surprise I actually passed, nobody called me anything other than ma'am the entire night. I have a hard time believing it was anything other than country because I definitely don't look female to myself, but my friend tried to convince me it was in my head. I felt absolutely great while we were out and have never been more confident in myself. Right until I got home and took of the makeup. Suddenly the man in the mirror was staring right back at me, and like an idiot I took off the makeup before the dress (dresses tend to really trigger my dysphoria, yesterday was the first time I've felt comfortable in one). It got so bad that despite how great the rest of the day had actually been I was crying myself to sleep. Does anyone have similar experiences? How do you handle the the dysphoria when it hits you like that? Thanks a lot in advance &lt;3",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I have been wanting to come out to HR for over a month now and the anxiety has been just getting worse everyday I thought about it. Everyday I would tell myself this is the day but I would freak out as soon as I seen the office door. Well today I finally did it and am very please with the response. 

It can be very hard for each step we take in our journey but you never know how things will be until you do it. I kept telling myself that even though Im scared to talk to HR I know I'll leave her office in a good mood. Things like this just have to be faced head on and with a positive outlook.

Although it seemed odd to me the response I got was excitement. The HR lady seemed happy for me and excited that she could help. She told me her number 1 goal is to insure my safety and to make sure there is no harassment. 

Pretty much what Im getting at in this post is we all have doubts and low points. We all get to a point where we feel stuck and can't move forward. Just believe in yourself and push forward when you hit a wall and you will be surprised just how good the results can be. This hasn't been my first hang up but it was definitely the hardest.

"I've always been pansexual but relatively grossed out by 'guy guys' and men, liking women, trans people and feminine men at least in a sexual context. I started HRT around a year ago now and for the last handful of months noticed a pretty serious opening up of my sexuality? I've been dating 2 guys who are really sweet, younger than myself by 4 years and not super masculine but still like, guys and I actually quite like having a boyfriend (and 3 long term girlfriends)  Which is something I never expected. I guess I'm curious if this happened to any other trans girls primarily attracted to women? Also i used to think I was a top but now I get really tingly and fluttery when I fantisize about certain guys taking control and fucking me.I wonder if I feel this strongly about it, it means I'm closer to straight even though romantically I'm much more into women?

"its not really a rant either. i just need to get my thoughts out some where.

i started HRT on Oct 19th. WHen I started I felt happy and amazing. my Confidence grew.  I felt like everything was working properly like I had he right plumbing.

On Nov 19th - I already started noticing changes. Even the slightest change made me feel happy. Forward to Mid December and I was told that my estrogen is too high and that they can't re-order my estrogen. I still take my spiro tho. At this point tho I noticed hair thinning and facial hair thinning. CHest hair was thining. I felt even more amazing. So at the time I'm like ok 1780 is super high Im sure I can hold out until I see my doctor next. Too be honest it was probably too high as I was literaly crying over nothing.

Forward to present day now and I don't feel happy anymore. I feel different. I think my estrogen is too low now. I don't feel feminine and I hate being a dude. I feel like I got teased and suffering from it. Like I get it they're trying to keep me safe. Blood clots who wants that. I just feel like certain parts of my system is falling apart. My hair that was thinning is growing in again. I think My ""bald"" spot is going bald again. A lot of hair grew back in. I have 2 weeks until I see my doctor again and I'm hoping I'll be ok. Dysphoric episodes are the worst and I really don't want to experience those again. My friends keep telling me that I look the same and I still look feminine. But I feel different. Maybe it's just a plecebo thing because I'm not taking estrogen right now. I dunno.

OK sorry just need to talk. 

Edit:
I need to talk some more.

For me, I don't know about any one else, dysphoric epsidoes involve suicidal thoughts. They are relentless and very difficult to control. Since starting HRT literally halted those.  I once confused it for bi-polar disorder. I'll be happy one minute and want to die the next. Sounds pretty bi-polar right. I think that's why people confuse gender dysphoria to bi-polar disorder. Completely not even related. To treat bi-polar they take lithium for trans people we take estrogen. Not even in the same drug category.

"Those of you who now live full time as your authentic self, did you deal with loneliness prior to and how did you deal with it?

In some ways I feel like I've had lots of friends and in some ways I don't.  What I mean by that is many feel more like acquaintances.  Probably because as time goes on people settle down and go their separate ways. I've had very good friends in the past and before everyone went separate ways, most of the time was spent drinking and partying.  Although I was heavily repressing my trueself, we had fun times.

Since then, I got married, became a dad and got divorced with full custody.  I enjoy the time I spend with my daughter but I don't get much time to get out and when I do most of my old friends are either difficult to get hold of or they are busy with their families.

I know I should meet knew people but I hesitate because I don't want new friends to see me as a man.  With old friends, its still difficult but they already have the male image of me.  I tried finding other trans people in the area but everyone seems to be looking for some kinds of fwb which I'm not looking for any kind of physical relationship.

"So, I have pretty recently realized that I might be trans. I feel a lot of similar feelings to other posters, and pretty much every search I have done on /r/asktransgender has come up with a someone else who felt the same thing as I have. I realized that I am jealous of women's bodies and their clothes. I realized that I relate to female protagonists in books and on TV. If I can get over my embarrassment, I pick a female character in video games. I have tried on women's clothing, and like the feeling of it. When I think of being a girl, and look at other trans women's success, I get an ache in my chest. But all of this is undermined by the fact that every time I think about being transgender, or myself transitioning, or just being a girl, I often become aroused.

I just can't get over that it might be a fetish. My first exposure to transgender characters, specifically boys to girls, was through erotic fiction. This led to a rabbit hole of me eventually only seeking out these types of stories, and then just doing research on the topic.

I have had dreams about just being a girl. Before I go to bed, I make up stories in my head about being males changed into girls; some are sexual, but many are not. I just can't seem to separate what is sexual attraction and what is wanting to be female. 

Is there some technique or something to be sure?

"Doc says I have to fax them for the sake of my privacy, but I feel thoroughly exposed trying to fax these papers at Office Depot. I mean, maybe if they didn't all saying things like ""**INFORMED CONSENT--TESTOSTERONE FOR TRANSGENDER PATIENTS**"" and ""**YOUR BODY'S CHANGES ON TESTOSTERONE**"" and ""**TRANSGENGEDER HEALTHCARE PATIENT INTAKE FORM**"" and  ""**SEXUAL CHANGES**"" in big bold letters on the top of the pages. But I gotta fax all 17 pages, so I took them to Office Depot. Tried to be very discreet, and then the guy just takes them and starts rifling through them. Puts them in the machine and they start going through, but then goes to do something else so when they come out of the machine they fly all over. Them the machine jams. He picks all the paper back up but it's all out of order, so now he's sorting through them trying to put them back in order for me. I say ""please let me do that"", he insists he's got it, I more firmly say ""give me my papers"", and he reluctantly hands them over so I can sort them back into order. I once again try to hand them to him somewhat discreetly, and again he starts rifling through them, counting out the number of pages before it jammed, and takes those seven and puts the other ten back in the machine, and then just fucking walks around holding the first seven pages. I ask him to give them to me, he says ""but I'm not sure if they went through"", I say I'd like to hold them, he gives them back, I hold them for a minute while he helps other customers, then he comes back and asks for them back and tries to put all 17 pages back through. I ask if there's anything wrong, and he says ""no it just takes a minute, why don't you wander a little?"" so I do, and as each page comes through he sets them god damn face up on the fucking counter that other customers are coming up to, with my sensitive medical paperwork just laying their face up. I rush back and collect up the pages and flip them over. The machine jams again, this time at 10 pages. The guy gives me the rest of the pages, says to wait a minute cause it was sending pages through faster than it was faxing them so it needed to catch up, has another employee come help me, and goes to do other things. The exact same sort of blatant disregard for the sensitivity of my papers happens twice more with this second employee, and finally I just leave cause it's not going through.

I want to start hormones, I need to get these papers faxed, but god damn am I thoroughly embarrassed by tonight. I don't want to go back there. My parents asked me where I had been when I got home, and since I'm carrying an Office Depot bag (I bought a sim card for my phone at the beginning) and a stack of papers I can't very well lie so I say I had to fax things. Both of them offered to take it to work and fax it for me, but I didn't want them to see what I was faxing either (I'm out to them, but their responses were basically ""we're not gonna disown you or anything but we don't want to be a part of this"") so I said no and now they're gossiping trying to figure out what I was trying to send.

should I go back to stupid Office Depot? Would UPS or Kinkos be better? Is there anywhere I can do the faxing myself instead of having an employee do it? Because tonight was just awful.

Edit: update: this afternoon I went to the UPS store and tried to fax it again. They guy wouldn't let me self-fax but he was much better, didn't rifle through my pages or anything, and it went through easily (though we had to divide into into two parts; he let me do the dividing instead of going through himself.)

I chickened out because I felt ugly and not passable enough. An hour before our date he sent me a text telling me that he knows that a transition takes years and that he doesn't expect me to be perfect. He told me that he would take me for who I am and that he wants to see me growing as a woman and a person. 

I sent him a message half an hour before our date telling him that I won't come and that if he respects me he should leave me alone. I broke his heart. He sent me a text back that he waited there for an hour and that he understands my fears.

I threw out a pair  of my trainers/sneakers and replaced them  unisex shoes, just because I hate the fact they are too masculine. 



I've gone off certain interests, I hardly ever play video games now, I feel bad for being into cars, as that's a masculine thing. I know that women can like it, but I just dislike being associated with male interests as it makes me feel less like a woman.

"My girlfriend and I (both MTF) have pretty different experiences with genital dysphoria. I don't really have any and she has lots.

We've had really phenomenal sex in the past, and just holding her tight is still magical, but increasingly, touching or doing things that get her excited down there make her upset. We've talked about it and we're both committed to having sex that works for us. Since it's such a difficult issue for her I want to bring lots of options to the table for when we get to start scheming.

The Situation As I Currently Understand It:

* We don't have an issue with changing attractions; I can get her aroused easily.
* Her distress is with her own body. It doesn't bother her to see ""flaws"" reflected in mine.
* Seeing lumps where they don't belong freaks her out.
* She prefers to keep panties on.
* Touching downstairs is sometimes ok (less often lately) when it's clear that it's just heavy petting.
* Masturbation is equally problematic.
* She enjoys nipple play / light torture.
* Very ticklish: good sensations in moderation but easily goes sour.
* She wants to try but stuff but the level of prep involved puts her off.
* She needs to be stress-free to consider sex.

What Doesn't Work:

* Getting frisky under the blankets (too hot for her and too little communication)
* Treating her bits like they're the ones she wants (the touch still freaks her out)
* Anal (too messy and she feels like the pressure's on when it's something that involves planning, but she still wants to figure out how to make it work)

Any tips or tricks?

I've read about muffing and inguinal canal stuff which sounds intriguing and I think would probably be an ok place to touch. I think someone said that it looked like getting fingered, and with how much the optics mater to her I think that would be ideal. That said, I've experimented a little on myself to try to figure out how I would implement it for her, and I don't get any pleasurable sensation. Maybe I'm doing it wrong?",gender_dysphoria_disorder

I am FtM, Pre-transition on in all forms, except I have begun socially transitioning. I have a bad habit of inflicting guilt upon myself, for no good reasons other than overthinking. What can I say? The family I have is small, but treasured deeply: I couldn't stand knowing I did something that ended up hurting them. 

My greatest concern right now is... how will my transition psychologically affect my Biological child? 

My kiddo is two, as of right now, and my husband (his father) is very accepting of my transition too.

(No kidding: my husband laughed, came out to me as being Pan before ever meeting me, and admitted he was wondering how long it'd take for me to admit being who I am to myself)

But, no doubt to the scarcity of studies ever being done, I cannot find any reports on how well children mentally cope with a parent's transition. I have seen studies (that conflict one another) on same-sex parenting: but that's another can of worms I'd rather avoid opening right now.

- Difficulty sleeping
- Waking up with nighttime sweats
- Itchy skin. Worst areas are the mons pubis region, under the arms, lower arms and lower legs and ears.

After searching on the internet I seem to be showing the signs of Perimenopause:

- http://www.theperimenopauseblog.com/35-symptoms-of-perimenopause-dry-itchy-skin/

Is that even possible for transgender women?

I read that women in Perimenopause can alleviate the symptoms using progesterone, but I'm already on 5mg Androcur per day, which I thought was a strong progestin in itself. Would a progesterone cream be something that might help, or could it clash with the Androcur?

I use a gel pump for the estrogen, and my dosage has been halved from 4 pumps to 2. My most recent blood tests had my estrogen level over 600 pg/ml from a previous reading of 240, which was why is was reduced. The key difference being quitting smoking between the two tests.

I'm a trans girl, out, but not on hormones yet.

I have been tucking for three months, using what I could find since I live with my parents (I'm eighteen). Meaning I used what was recommended on youtube videos, a cut tube sock and the top of some pantyhose to make a gaff. I'm wearing it underneath another pantyhose and lycra boxers.
It kinda holds through the day, but it hurts a lot, especially while sitting in class, and I can barely focus. I have to use the bathroom every one hour and a half to relieve a bit of the pain.

I think it's due to the penis getting pulled in and by the folds of the gaff, especially beneath the butt, it's very uncomfortable. I also have no idea what to do with the extra skin, scrotum and such. My penis is kinda small but I don't know if it's related.

Please excuse any bad English or things I may have worded badly, maybe even offensively I don't know, I am tired right now :(


I'm an 18 years old male(?) currently identify as homosexual, but I'm not entirely sure about My gender anymore.


This all started last year, when I 'came out' to myself as not straight, then some friends and gradually got to where I am now identifying as gay, throughout this process of figuring myself out I also kind of started to question gender, I've always viewed myself badly and had no confidence.


When I started to identify as gay, I started to act more feminine, tried to raise my voice when talking with my close friends. This made me really happy, I looked in the mirror and didn't think badly of myself that day, it felt really weird.


For the longest time I've kinda wished I was a girl, and I can safely say that if I was given the option to time travel and make myself be born female, I would without thinking twice about It.


I absolutely hate being masculine, when my voice goes deep when I'm tired or sick I hate speaking because it makes me sound too manly.

When I look at really muscly men I don't think of being them at all, it disgusts me to even think of being that manly.


But I don't feel the same way at all when I think of myself as a girl, I think I'd be fine with it...


On the flipside, i don't know if I am entirely comfortable identifying as a girl and being transgender, I know that if I was I also wouldn't want to transition as I hate meds and operations and all those things.


I looked into it some, I found the demigender labels and i think demigirl suits me well, but i don't know...

My muscle twitched a bit from this, but apart from that it felt more or less like the one I did in the clinic. 

Now, my concern, is that should I have aspirated again when I shoved the needle back down? Could I have unwittingly injected into a vein/blood vessel? There were few tiny bubbles (which the nurse told me were fine) but I'm scared of something bad happening if they ended up in my bloodstream.",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"So, I (28,AMAB) just came out to my wife (26,cis-female) today and destroyed both our worlds. To her credit, she never raised her voice. However, she was seriously not OK with it. 

We have been actually doing very well together. We have always been in sync but these last few days have been closer than we have been for a while. The subject came up about kids again and I declined. When pressed for the reason I decided to come out. 

I've been in therapy for the last two months and had known I was transgender for years, but I could never get the courage to come out. Weather has stopped me from my last two sessions and I have been hanging on a limb over it till tonight.

After the tears and confusion was over and the shock came in she called her parents up and had them come over. After coming out a second time to them, they let into me as to how stupid I was for coming out. They insisted I should have had three therapists, a letter from my GP (which won't be able to see me till March) and should have broken it to her at the Therapist office. There were surprisingly few questions, just a few ""How do you know"" and ""What do you want from being a woman"" questions. I tried my best, but it clearly didn't ease any hostility.

I want to transition and deal with the dysphoria that has been eating me up. However, my wife has told me that there is nothing for us down that path, and we will be strained from now on if I don't transition and find other ways to deal with it.

I don't live by any of my family and my friends have suddenly dried up. I'm at home alone and feeling like an idiot. I felt like I had thought things through and had it planned out. Now I am alone surrounded by a house contains all I have achieved in life and I feel I just gave it all away for nothing. She even took the dog I loved on her way out to stay with her parents. I'm on the edge and considering getting a box of ammo and ending it tonight. F--k being strong, I am stupid enough to wreak my marriage, not to far from ending my life. I mean, it already feels over already. Do I just go back to living with increasingly suicidal dysphoria, or end it with some dignity? Did I really need all that s--t her parents wanted anyways? Can I really be OK losing it all? I don't even know if my job will keep me after Trump takes office. Is being Transgender such a ""fad"" diagnosis that I can't be honest? Why couldn't they just be ignorant biggots, at least then I could have written it off better... Sorry for the vent, but I really need anyone right now.

"so ive been at home from school, kinda wasting away, trying to recover from this prostatitis, which basically makes it impossible for me to tuck because it will be very painful. Now im starting to think it's chronic because the antibiotics are finished and Ive seen some improvement but im not in the slightest cured. This has driven me into a deeper depression where I dont shave or keep myself more feminine looking. I feel disgusting and although today i will shave my body again, I wont be able to wear panties still and have to wear mens underwear, which makes me sad. I really was proud of myself for replacing my mens underwear over the last year. im at home, going by owen, because my parents (as much as they try to understand) are still uncomfortable and honestly, I'm uncomfortable going by Julia around them. Also my shitty cousin lives with us and she makes me so fucking jealous. She's beautiful and sheltered and literally doesn't have to worry about anything it feels like (which probably isnt true, but it seems that way). Anyway, on the prostatitis reddit page, I feel weird as a trans person posting there and I wish there was more info on transgender ppl with prostatitis because I cant imagine any of us having an easier time with it than cis people.

And while driving home after a therapist appointment (yay for an hour drive back!) where I laid out my best anti-arguments it kinda hit me. I'm trans. The way I see myself, the way I interact with women and men and want to be seen by others. Those times I've joined men's groups to ""learn how to be a man"" so I can act like it.

I'm now letting that sit with me but it got me thinking, even though I'm transgender, I don't need to act now. All options available before acceptance are still available. Sure, I feel the clock ticking if I ever plan on being a cute 20-something, but I don't have to rush.

And I kinda feel freer now to lose those extra pounds, work on that voice, buy that cute top and rock it.

"I've been full time for the past year everywhere but work, until (hopefully) this week. I'm going to be going to court to make the name change final this month (everything's already prepared) so that means finally telling my boss. I'm not worried that my work isn't going to be accepting, as I work for a tech company that is very inclusive, what I'm worried about is way less reasonable sounding.

So, my boss is trans. She works in a separate office (we have multiple locations) but is the head of my department, which in my office consists of only 4 employees including myself. One of the four is transmasculine. So, when I come out at work, 2/4 of us, half of us will be trans, with a trans boss. I'm worried that people will think this is anything more than coincidence. Our department is small but the company as a whole is not too small, I think we have like 200 employees at my office total. 

Of course, I know no one would make this drastic of a change, and go through so much shit for anyone but themselves. Buuuuut, that still doesn't stop me from feeling like someone will think that, that I'm trying to get in my boss's favor oooor that our boss is playing favorites and intentionally filling the department with trans folks... I've even had fleeting concerns that my boss will be mad about it, because it could it could put her under the spotlight to be accused of favoritism or something.

I'm going to bring it up to her hopefully tomorrow or Friday since she is going to be in town, buuuuut.... I'm scared.

I'm afraid that they'll try to tell me that I'm not feminine, or that I am masculine, because they probably think that telling me that I'm feminine would hurt my feelings or something.

I've heard from doctors that implants are the best because of the high E levels and relative lack of side effects, but after reading into them I've found stories with somewhat mixed responses. I've heard that they don't cycle your estrogen levels as well as they should and this can cause tachyphylaxis, while I know you have to replace the implants every 4-6 months anyway, I was just wondering if this time frame is enough to ward off said tachyphylaxis.

"I have read that puberty does not end at 18 (I'm nearly 19) and may continue masculising well into the 20s. I am terrified that permanent developments such as facial bone growth and height may still be waiting for me and it's making me feel suicidal. 

I'm already getting less than six hours sleep some nights because I read that less sleep means less puberty. 

I already know I'll have to have FFS because HRT alone won't change my brow and eagle-like expression. But I guess I've still got fat in my cheeks and I'm terrified of losing it: http://imgur.com/a/3klPd

The NHS waiting list for me is said to be 10 months and I have yet to phone up the GIC and confirm whether I'm on it. By my first appointment my face might be even more manly then it is now. I'm already 5'9 and don't want to grow any taller.

My parents are supportive but they just can't seem to see what I'm getting at. And my parents were terrified for me when I suggested using the internet to find a GP like Dr Webberley who sells bridging prescriptions. 

I've already had a previous GP in the same surgery patronise me and 'play God' by trying to send me off to a mental disability centre. And now that I finally have a GP whose supportive my parents say I don't wanna rock the boat by being impatient and pestering him by checking up that he's referred me to the GIC. 

But I'm finding it hard to be patient and live in the present moment when my body may be continuing to masculinise. I look at photos of myself from two years ago and I haven't really changed much at all, but that makes me feel like some kind of spurt is being stored up to catch me out. Plus, the sooner I start the better I will look female. 

I didn't worry too much in my mid-teens because I thought I could get away with not transitioning, 'convinced' myself it was all a fetish and that masculinity was the 'cure.' If I had known the intense emotions of wanting to be a girl were here to stay, I would've started earlier. 

The main reason I ask about puberty blockers and not HRT as well is because I have five months of my college A levels left and don't want things to get awkward in the classrooms.

It's not that I care about what others will think. I'm a complete nobody so I have no one really to come out to other than my seven siblings (who don't even live with me.) 

If I'm successful in getting a private prescription can I take puberty blockers as a standalone prevention measure during the five months? 

Would it guarantee no more irreversible male changes to my body? Or should I just leave it till June when I wrap up for the summer?

My dad's side of the family are quite liberal and probably would not do anything too drastic, but because of the little one, things might become a bit more complicated... complicated as in... my family kept addressing me as kor kor [and then my guy name] (which means older brother). Having them call me that fells like I'm getting stabbed in the heart. I know that they don't know and it's not their fault, but I can't change the way I feel. If I do come out to them, it's gonna be hard to explain it to the little one and that's what's holding me from coming out... if things go south, and I'd have to choose between her and the family and me doing what I'm doing, without a second heartbeat I'd choose continuing doing what I'm doing.. but it would be saddening that I could potentially lose a huge pillar of support... 

On my mom's side, she's very understanding but if anything happens she'd always blame herself and think that she did something to caused that. Now she's in no way suicidal, but might go into depression like she did after my parents split up..

I've become increasingly concerned recently that they are very unlikely to consider that I've done enough to warrant treatment. I don't expect to be recommended for HRT for quite some time. The problem is that I haven't been making many changes to my living situation since I was first referred.

On the one hand, I present as at least a little feminine on a daily basis, professionally and personally. I wear makeup daily and nail polish regularly, and most of my wardrobe is made up of womens jeans and t-shirts and things. On the other hand, I have failed to: come out to anyone who actually lives in the same city as me, except for my gf; change my name; think of a name I'd like to  change my name to; ever leave the house in clothing that couldn't be mistaken for menswear; work on my voice; or in any way intentionally presented as female.

I have heard from a number of sources that treatment will be further delayed if I'm not out and living as a woman. And I've been told that if they don't see me as a woman when I turn up, they won't think I'm taking this seriously. But I think I might've pushed myself as far as I can possibly go without support.

"Sup!

So I started hormones about six months ago. After some initial worries and doubts I've gotten used to them and they've helped with my dysphoria so much. 

Without constant dysphoria, I'm way less concerned with what a woman is supposed to do, how they're supposed to look and how they're supposed to dress and I've started exploring myself a lot more. 

I like to dress way more masc than most of the girls I know, I like to shout more than the girls I know, I like to compete more than the girls I know, and I like to hit the gym way way more (and harder) than the girls I know. I'm super into being the strongest and best and just generally pushing myself harder now that I'm not absolutely terrified of anything that's traditionally associated with 'masculine'. I guess I'd say I'm a tomboy, or whatever. 

Anyway I've been reading about the effects of testosterone on muscle building and muscle growth, and I fully understand that it will be much slower and more difficult now that I'm all E'd up. But I've also been reading about the effects of birth control in CIS women and how blocking the boost in T people get from exercise can effect strength in a pretty major way. I'm sort of worried that T-blockers will effect me in the same way - I'm not concerned about being disadvantaged against males because that's obvious and I no longer compare myself to them, I'm just worried that I'll be disadvantaged against other women when it comes to progressing from training.

It's frustrating because all the articles I read on MTF fitness and training are like ""top ten tips to shrink your thighs!"" and ""how to get a killer toned butt!"" rather than ""How to bench press the universe like the absolute savage you were born to be!""...

I try not to bring it up with her, and avoid talking to her in general now, but sometimes I have tro, and somehow something to do with being trans comes up, and she always either looks at me like I'm talking nonsense, or just flat out laughs at me.

We live and study in the same class together, so she's always around. She always wants to walk into uni together, which means we spend a lot of time together just us. She never tries to make conversation walking into uni, so it falls upon to talk and force conversation out of her, and again inevitable some trans stuff comes up. These days I try and avoid talking with her, but it makes it really awkward in the mornings in the flat :/

Am I being overly sensitive, or is she being a horrible person? I can't tell, It makes me feel terrible, but when friends are around they ignore it, and she acts like I'm being really over sensitive when I try and bring it up with her.

For example, just now we were discussing the shower being broke, and I said we'll have to get gym memberships to use their showers, and she gives me a weird look, and I say, ""Agh, that'll be a bit of a problem for me :/"" and she just laughs her head off and walks away.

Another example is one time this guy started harassing me when I was trying to go to into the local LGBT support centre. It really shook me up and upset me, so I got home really upset, and and she saw. So she asked what was wrong. This was about a month into knowing her so I told her, and she laughed her head off.

"I'm 21 MtF and about 1.5 months on hormones. Before starting hormones, I had gynecomastia (male breast growth) in my right breast, however it was only mild. After starting hormones, my right breast has grown much faster than the left, and the hard gynecomastia lump that was under the nipple has spread almost entirely around the nipple also, and is tender to touch. The lymph node between my right nipple and right armpit also has swollen, and the mass is firm/hard/tender. I figured it was normal for one to grow faster than the other, and ignored it.

Last week I discovered a lump in my left groin, and immediately thought it was a hernia because it was quite painful. Went to the doctor and he said that while it's possibly a hernia, it's too firm/solid and doesn't move when I cough (like a hernia should). He asked if I had any infections in my left leg, and I haven't. I'm having an ultrasound on it tomorrow.

EDIT: from what I've read, a lump in the groin can be generally three things: hernia, infection, or cancer. If it isn't a hernia (doc didn't think it was), and it isn't infection (he asked, I haven't been sick or had an infection in the leg in forever), then cancer seems to be a likely possibility to me?

I'm starting to get concerned. Firm/solid lumps are often indications of malignancy/cancer from what I've read... and I now have two, in different areas of the body, and both of which have formed after starting hormones.

I lived under their house for few months now after I got back from university. (I am only taking few semesters off). And I've tried so hard for them to like me but after all these months, they won't :) which means they will be abandoning me if I continue with this ""lifestyle"".

I am actually really glad. I fucking hate them anyway. I might sound like a total  bitch but at least they will pay for my college and stuffs and after college, I am all on my own.

Some religion can be so fucking cancerous that can potentially brainwash people and the victims happened to be my parents. I am glad I flunked out of religion and have my own beliefs.

I never really met anybody transphobic than my parents and living with them really let me know the definition of transphobia.

If I ever have a child of my own and they happen to be gay, bi, trans or whatever, I guarantee them that kicking them out will be the last thing I'd do to them. I will love them no matter what. And I will make sure that their fate won't be like mine.

After she left I had a shower and stuff because I was all icky and sweaty from my walk, dressed up in my favorite girl clothes and sat in the lounge and had coffee, then randomly burst into tears, i'm so freaking happy right now, I literally cannot remember being this happy ever before, hopefully this feeling sticks around!",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"So my previous post gave me a lot to think about, and I am pretty sure that I am trans. I really want to go see a gender therapist, but I do have some questions that I think will help me move along my trans-journey.

My family isn't the most accepting, but I can't really see myself just cutting them out of my life. I want to know, if I started on hormones, just how well could I hide it? I feel like I could transition in everyday life, and I don't have to see my family that often. I don't use social media, so that isn't an issue. I also feel that I would be fine if they just thought I was feminine, or if they thought I was secretly gay or something. I know that a lot of people say that after a few months they have trouble hiding changes; but, I feel that as a girl, I don't really want to be overly feminine. I don't want to always wear dresses or stuff like that, I don't want long fingernails, and my eyebrows are naturally pretty well formed. I am a little over weight, and have been for all my life. I don't want big breasts, in fact I would probably feel uncomfortable with them, although I am not sure. I would probably do voice training, but I don't feel like I will get a tracheal shave. 


To sum this all up, could I pass off a feminized face and body as simply losing weight; could I maintain both my masculine and feminine voices; and, as I don't want large breasts, could i just pass it of as pesky leftover fat, or gynecomastia? Any other changes they might pester me about, but I know they won't be too bad.


Sorry if it sounds like I want the easy way out or something, I don't know. I might change my mind at a later date, and am open to doing so. I just feel like this is a big hurdle to get over, and if I knew that I could just ignore it, I could start accepting myself as a women, and move forward with a transition.


P.S. Talking about this in realistic terms is honestly exciting. It feels like a load of of my chest. I can't wait to go see a therapist, and normally I hate them.

"Hi everyone!  So, of course, I'm continuing on my journey and it's come to the point that I'm looking into how this can be done at my job.  I've got a bit of a unique dilemma.

A few months ago, my company had the HR policies be reviewed with us and with a lawyer, went over everything they expected us to do, and what they were going to do themselves.  Included in that was an explicit statement of supports of transition.  They explained an example and that it was supported.  

Great, right?

Well, I'm a trans woman, obviously coming from a CIS male presentation, in an office full of men.  I'm talking like 50 men, once CIS woman, and me.

I feel like I'm covered on the legal side, but the thought of others' reactions kind of frightens me.

So, does anyone have a similar experience?  How did it go?  

And, what's your advice on the whole thing?  

Should I just transition and change jobs to avoid problems?

I could use anything on this.  Greatly appreciated!

"No stupid questions right?

A long while back I ran into a funny ""parlor trick"" that ""proved"" women could do something men could not. It was made popular on the show [All in the Family.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXxrfqY0kA0)

1. Step three foot lengths, toe to heel, away from a wall.

2. Place a chair between you and the wall

3. Lean over so that by touching the wall with your head, your body is an exact right angle, legs straight.

4. Lift the chair to your chest

5. Stand up

The vast majority finds that while women can do this, men cannot, supposedly due to women having a lower center of gravity. [Plenty of Youtube videos show this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW0ZTvRCS1o)

We did this experiment in High School, and it was true, none of the boys could lift the chair. All the girls could. I even remember going home and trying with my family and sister. I couldn't lift it. She could.

Fast forward to today, after 5 radical months of HRT. The trick popped into my mind after feeling for the last month like my walking was getting wobbly and unbalanced. At times I felt like something had changed and I didn't know how to compensate for it. Walking with my hips seemed to do the trick, but I'd still wobble and not always get it right. I wrote it off as learning how to walk like a girl was messing with my head. But what if... I had to try!!

Up went the chair, and up I stood. I was dumbfounded. This was a thing on HRT?!

*No no, that can't be right.*

Slippers, then Socks. Then Shoes. Different shoes. Different chair. Different wall! Farther away. Closer. 

Every time up went the chair, and up I stood as seamlessly and effortlessly as the girls in the videos. Damn was that reaffirming. All is finally right in the universe.

So my question to all of you (both MtF and FtM) AND both pre and post HRT, what are your results? 

1. Are you a trans woman or trans man?
2. How long have you been on HRT?
3. Have you felt your center of gravity shift?
4. Can you stand up?
5. Could you stand up prior to HRT?

"So, I recently moved across the country days after starting HRT. My starting dosage was 4mg E and 50 mg Spiro. 

Fast forward a month, and I have found a new doctor in my new state. He upped my Spiro dose to 100mg, but took me off E temporarily until I quit smoking cigarettes (went off for about a week, in the end). So, today I go in to see him again, I got my E back, but he has me down to 2mg. Whatever, he's the doctor. 

However, his reasoning was a little odd to me. He said he did some reading over the holidays, and read that  up estrogen levels more slowly leads to better breast growth. High estrogen levels too quickly can lead to faster breast growth, but with weird hard boobs. Whereas stepping estrogen levels up over time leads to more natural feeling breast development. At least, that's what he said.

So, basically, my question is has anyone else heard of this theory? It's just a bit odd to me that I have never heard this before. Especially considering what a frequent topic of conversation breast growth seems to be around here.

Another question I have, that's sort of related: early in transition, how frequently should a hormone panel be done? Is once every three months sufficient to tweak dosages?",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I am a 26 year old guy who has crossdressed for the last 2 years. I came out to my wife that I had always wanted to dress and although she is supportive with my hobby, she does not feel comfortable being at home while I dress and has never seen me in girl mode. I've never truly been happy with myself and I really am only happy these days while dressed.

 since I started dressing I have been proctoring her to take part in girl time with me, but she has always refused. It has definitely led to some tension in our relationship. Over this time I have always told her that I didn't want to transition at any point that dressing was just a hobby. Lately I have been questioning that.

 Sometimes if I look in front of the mirror and close my eyes I see a woman's reflection staring back at me. I hold my hand out in front of my face and see a woman's hand with painted nails. I looked down and see a woman's body with a cute outfit on. And it scares the hell out of me.

 I hate myself for feeling this way. I have a career that is not exactly known for being the most progressive field of work. I just started a five-year apprenticeship that could lead me to making over $100,000 a year. I have been working in this trade for close to 10 years and it is all I know. My job takes me into a lot of industrial places and requires quite a bit of strength and dealing with severe weather while working outside often times.

 I so often wish I could transition and be a girl full time, but I don't want to throw my life away. My wife and I had already been married for over a year when I came out to her. It took her by complete surprise. Like many people, I have over compensated with masculinity in my life. Grew large beard, spend a lot of time working on my truck and restoring antique tractors, picking a very physical labor career, chewing tobacco, and so on. I spent years getting picked on and bullied due to being a sensitive kid and crying a lot, and if compensated by being a big tough guy with little emotion to show. I'm afraid if I were to start transitioning I would lose my career that I am very good at and enjoy, my wife who I love more than anything, and my family.

It seems like the more I dress the more and my wife and I seem to drift apart. After I go back into guy mode, I get very depressed for a few days following. I end up shutting her out and sink into my PC and zone out with video games. Our sex life has been steadily decreasing since I came out due to the tension between us.

I don't work out or exercise at all, but because of my very physical job, I am very strong although overweight. I average close to 20K steps a day according to my pedometer while often carrying  40 to 50 pounds of tools on me, but I have always tended to eat my problems away and drink too much beer. I would love to be in better shape but I hate my body too much to really give a damn. If I were to transition I feel like I would be much happier with myself and would push myself to lose the extra weight. I'm afraid though that even if I were to lose weight, I would still have to be very muscular to be able to do my job. Most of the guys I work with are over weight and those who are not are still very large and strong due to the nature of our work. If I were to transition, I think I would have to give up my career to have a remotely feminine body.

My wife and I have an agreement where if I really want to dress for a full day on a weekend, she will go spend time shopping or hanging out with her sisters or my sister. This agreement works out fine for the both of us. I always have to fight the temptation to stay dressed after she calls me to let me know she's on her way home. Neither of us want kids at this time and part of that is because I don't want to have to give up my dressing and part of it is because of the tension between us that all of this has caused. Also we have 5 nieces and nephews that we can rent whenever we want, we don't feel like buying at this time. Lol. 

She is the only one in my life that I am out too, and she hates the fact that she can't discuss it with anybody. We were both going to therapy for a while but stopped due to financial issues at the time. I have not talked to her about my feelings to transition because I'm afraid I will lose her. My wife is my rock and has been with me for close to 10 years now. Although I love her dearly, I feel so much resentment towards her sometimes because I feel like I can't truly be myself around her. She was very upset that I did not come out to her until after we had been married for a year. She understands that I wasn't ready to come out to myself until that time but she still feels hurt.

I have a few awesome groups of friends that I hang out with on a regular basis. Unfortunately I live in a small rural town, that isn't exactly progressive. My brother in law is probably my best friend and I'm sure that if I were to lose my wife, I would lose him too. I am also very close friends with a guy I work with but he is extremely religious and holds some very outdated views. A lot of my friends that I grew up with in my small town whole lot of the same views, even if they are not religious at all. If I were to the world I might end up losing most of my friends.

So now comes the questioning part. Do I come out as trans and risk losing my career, my wife, my friends, and my family, or do I keep on the path that I'm going? I just don't know anymore. I hate the feeling of being in the wrong body and hating myself, but I don't want to lose everything I've worked so hard for in my life and be in a worst place than before. I know I'm only 26 and have my entire life in front of me that I could build a new life for myself, but that scares the shit out of me.

"Sorry for formatting, this is my first post.

I've always been questioning my gender. Hopping back and forth between being unsure/afraid and trying to tell myself to ""ignore it"" in order to make my life easier. But, after yesterday I think I finally realized I need to stop lying to myself and just accept that I am not comfortable being female.

Except now I feel and look horrible.

Yesterday, since my hair was getting obnoxiously long, I had it cut. I walked out of the salon incredibly upset because I didn't realize how feminine it was going to make me look. My previous hair was long, but it was messy and still rather ""boyish"" in style.

I came home in tears, I didn't see myself in the mirror, I felt wrong. In a fit of dysphoria, sadness, and a multitude of wild emotions, I grabbed the nearest scissor and began hacking at my hair without thinking. I even grabbed an electric razor and shaved chunks off. I made my mom cry because she didn't understand why I was doing this to myself. And now I'm sitting here in regret asking myself the same question.

I have random bald patches on my head now, and my hair looks absolutely hideous. I'm going to be stuck wearing a beanie for months unless I somehow salvage this mess or just shave everything off and start anew.

I'm not so much asking on how to fix my hair, rather.. I don't know how to recover from this. I finally realize I'm FTM, except now I look like a mess. Depression and Bipolar have already been ripping at me like crazy, and I don't know what to do with myself, or where to start.

How do I pick myself back up and make progress in taking the right steps..? I feel like I've waited too long, even though I'm only 21.

But, one sign for me is this.  I don't know if it's just a coincidence, but it might be. 


My first ever real friend (I'm going to call her Ellie) was female (I'm AMAB). There was some sort of connection I had with Ellie and always did. This was when I was 4 years old. 

My mum said that we where so close, we where almost impossible to be separated. Obviously being 4 y/o I don't have strong memories of being with her, but I've seen a few photos of me at this play group and I noticed how I was with a group of girls and not a group of boys. It's the only photo I have though.

Is there a comprehensive list held anywhere of insurers and what they cover for transgender patients?

I'm not at all in the system for being transgender yet and have the intention of starting private health insurance in order to start receiving private care. I believe this will be much quicker than using the NHS.

NHS treatment looks terrible. They have year long waiting lists just to be seen and force transgender patients to prove ""living everyday as opposite gender"" for as long as a year before allowing various treatments. This is absolutely not an option for me. I know I'll kill myself if subjected to the hate I would receive and the constant self reflection on my appearance I would be performing by not having the body I should have yet being forced to live publicly as female before even having treatment. Right now I hate myself but nobody else does. The problems I have would rocket upwards.

I don't know what or where I should be looking at to ensure I sign up with the right insurer. Nor do I know where I should look to make sure I've been with the insurer long enough to be covered at the time I ""come out"" with the issue.

Now a few months since transitioning I seem to open up sexual attraction to man as well in the form of occasional day dreaming.
It is like an inquisitive thought poking my consciousness saying: are you reaaally sure about your orientation as well?
Gender and sexual orientation are separate entities of course and I didn't really expect this to happen and it confuses me. Then again, I am confused as is by this whole transition process, so it is not a bad thing :)

"So I had top surgery about a month ago and even though I had sort of a hard time right after going off the Vicodin (I was on half of a typical dose for about a week), I bounced back after that and was able to start slowly resuming normal life. I do have a lot going on in my life because I'm still pretty early in transition (six months on T), still getting my family onboard, etc...however, I feel like I was handling it pretty well.

Until about 10 days ago when I went back to work and started feeling extremely depressed and also continuing to have referred pain in my shoulders from all the nerves re-connecting and such. I had periareolar top surgery so it wasn't super invasive but I have an old shoulder injury that now seems to be causing additional nerve pain. 

I'm planning to call the surgeon's office about the pain tomorrow, but as for the depression, that's what actually concerns me more. It did coincide with a spell of some pretty gloomy winter weather (I live in the Bay Area and we've had horrendous disgusting rain for like fucking ever). and I am prone to Seasonal Affective Disorder, but this feels like it's beyond that. 

I just feel really down... I find myself caring less about all the things in my life which I would usually consider positive- having a nice place of my own, my band, having a job that's relatively painless and allows me to afford living where I do, my girlfriend, stuff like that. I just want nothing to do with anyone, I don't care about food, I want to sleep so that I don't have to be conscious and feeling this way, and the worst part is I can't even really cry that easily or talk about it. 

Suddenly all the things that were exciting and interesting to me, feel like draining obligations and burdens. I'm also sort of freaking out about my surgery results even though my chest looks really good...I keep looking down from certain angles and thinking I still have boobs and it's really fucking with me. The healing scars are making my areolas look fucking huge, which is also really jarring to me. I constantly worry that every move I make, I will fuck up the results somehow. And it's really aggravating to not be able to play bass or go to the gym and to feel like I still have to be so careful.

On top of that, I'm still getting misgendered and I've just run out of the mental energy to correct people. 

When I was recovering and home from work, and all of my friends were stopping by to hang out, I felt fine. Now I just feel completely disconnected from my life, myself, and my feelings.

"I'm not quite sure how to phrase this, but today I'm feeling what you might call ""reverse dysphoria."" The thought of wanting be a woman makes me gag a little bit. This feeling comes occasionally.

In fact, from what I can tell, I rarely feel regular dysphoria (i.e. I don't mind being a man, I don't feel weird when people say ""he/him,"" I'm neutral about my body though I've never really *liked* the way it looked), but on the other hand, I do feel good when I imagine myself as a woman. So I have most of the positive reinforcement thoughts, but few of the negative reinforcement ones.

But, some days, I don't feel any desire to be a woman at all. I'm not sure what it is, but it's only making me more confused than I'd like to be.

I had always assumed that was what part of being a man was, ""Man Up!"" I believed, was some kind of affirmation of that.  That it was almost a call to arms of resisting that inner urge and struggle of wanting to be a woman.

I thought about it almost every night for at least a year, maybe two
But I told myself that it was wrong/unnatural/weird and tried to stop thinking about it.
Then my family moved, then middle school and high school... I kinda became too busy to think about it.
I'm sure I thought about it every now and then, but it was pretty repressed.

"I have heard transphobic arguments from students majoring in STEM-fields, especially biologists, and people devoted to an Atheist worldview.

They say that humans are biological beings just like animals and plants, so they are destined to a cisgender, male/female society just like apes, rodents, or reptiles are. Your chromosomes and sexual organs determine your gender, etc...

Richard Dawkins, a prominient biologist whose social commentaries are radically against religious bigotry, has posted transphobic comments on Twitter, saying that he ""doesn't believe"" in Transgenderism and calls Trans Women ""she"" ""out of courtesy.""

I found more tolerance towards Trans people in Neopagan, particularily Wiccan circles, who are perfectly fine with the notion that ""a female soul can inhabit a male body"" and vice versa.

What do you think about this? Do you think Neopaganism is more open-minded towards Trans people than Atheism?",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"To preface the question, I have been more and more inclined to question my gender over the past couple years. A while back I took up wearing skirts at home and will occasionally full on cross dress. I'm fairly closeted about it, though I am developing a small reputation and will do it when I go places where I won't be known. More recently I have tried out makeup and have grown out my hair so I can get a more feminine cut. 

When I was younger I was fascinated by the idea of reincarnation, and what I told myself was that if I were to come back, I would want it to be as a woman. More than that, it would be my own life I would have wanted to experience like that. Where I am today, I am at least grateful that I'm not especially masculine. I'm not tall, have little hair on my chest, and lack coarse skin. As a person I know I can be anxious and high strung, though that's par for the course in my family. 

That being said, the matter of my gender hasn't been much of an issue in my life until recently that it has caused me any distress. The distress isn't great and is more of a lingering feelingn that I think needs exploration. And by now I'm 25, so it feels too little too late for it to be a sign. I don't knot if I couldn't live with myself were I not to transition, on the other hand were somebody to hsnd me a potion that would change my sex, I would take it with few reservations.

I also don't like the idea of being stuck with meds for the rest of my life and having to do stuff to my body just because the world is fucked up. I feel like I don't deserve to go through such pain as a transition might come with. I feel like I am tired of feeling weird, I miss the cis privileges. And then I find myself testing the mindset of not transitioning and after a while I feel horrible. I have put so much into the fact that I am trams the last years, it's a very big part of constructing me a new self or a kind of sense of meaning since I've moved to this country (been here for four years now) after having to leave my southern country.

I would like to hear what your life was like before you came out. I am 15 years old, MTF and didn't come out yet.

So as I'm pretty short and super slim, many of the people I know think I'm cute and see my not existing masculinity as childishness. And even my girl friends think I'm just being cuter and nicer than the other boys. It's like I am a younger brother to them. 

The other thing I do is that I build ""fantasy"" worlds in my head, where I'm a girl. I ""live"" them when I'm alone. And the stories are pretty huge with many characters, who all have names and personalities. It's kinda like a parallel life I'm living in my head.

"Hi, I'm about 2 months into mtf HRT. For the past few days, I've been feeling like 'I' am 'breaking'. My mind has just started feeling hazy, and I feel almost dazed and just out of it. I found at https://redd.it/2ooepp that a possible explanation was ""As far as memories... I think my roommate referred to this as 'cognitive disconnect'. The HRT rewires your brain, so the memories are still there but are someone elses. They are very fact based, so unlike my memories of my new life, that dead guy's memories have no emotions or thoughts attached. I don't know what he was feeling when something happened, or what was going through his mind. It's like watching an old VHS tape of someone else's family videos. The picture and sound are all fuzzy, and it's from a third-person point of view."".

I obviously can't confirm that that is what is happening to me atm, but I can imagine this being a precursor to that, and I'm suddenly feeling uncomfortable with that as an option of a change. 

I do want to be a woman, but I haven't come to terms with 'killing' my old self almost. I feel....guilty...? I feel like in general I really value and appreciate reflecting and growing from my past in a framework of my emotional responses to situations. I don't know if I'm ok forgetting so much of that?

Has anyone experienced this? Do people feel like they have fundamentally changed as a person throughout HRT?  Like, in a framework of body (physical), mind (thoughts, hobbies, etc.), and soul (everything you felt was literally completely fundamentally intrinsic to your identity), do you feel like your soul/'essence' changed?

Do you still enjoy the same friends?

"So...questioning for a few months 47 MTF here. I don't really have a specific question. More just putting my thoughts down because I'm confused. But I welcome any feedback. 

Here is where I stand...
- I don't necessarily feel feminine. though I'm not even sure what that would be.
- I tend to get along with and feel more comfortable around females.
- The idea of socially transitioning and how it would impact job, relationships, etc. scares the hell out of me.
- I have started seeing a therapist.
- I don't hate my male self. But I could see myself as liking to be female also.
- I am pretty emotionally ""dead"" or detached inside. I rarely have stronge feelings about anything.
- I have started trying female undergarments and like the way they feel.
- I have been thinking about this daily since my questioning began.
- The ""button"" test...YES I would push it.
- I wonder if it's possible to transition with HRT and SRS but present as a female leaning masculine in appearance?

I probably just need more time to process my thoughts and come to terms with things.

"To preface this, I don't really consider myself transgender.

However, this seems like the most fitting place to ask based on the content of my question and the wealth of relevant knowledge this subreddit possesses.

Keep in mind that if I use any language or wording that could be considered offensive, it is not out of ill-intent. I am a social recluse both online and off with the exception of 4chan, so I have absolutely no idea how I'm supposed to say things. I assure you I will not use phrasing I found on 4chan.

I am a biological male, and identify as such. However, I don't like having an identifiably male body. I don't want a female body either, so I guess I want to be androgynous. This isn't really a gender thing for me - I feel male, I suppose - it's just about wanting a more comfortable body for myself.

My main issue is that my upper body (especially shoulders, back, and ribcage) are noticeably large. Huge, even. People think I'd make a great football player, if that helps get the idea across.

If you shaved off all of my body hair, spent an hour painting my face, and squeezed me into the prettiest dress you can find I would still look manlier than the average dude off the street. I've done it, once.

I've done everything I can to minimize it. I lost pretty much all of the fat on my body (I still somehow kept quite a bit on my butt and thighs, which is nice for my goal). I cut a lot of protein out of my diet and am sedentary to minimize muscle, even though it didn't work at all.

It seems like the only viable solution is hormones, unless there is some fancy diet change I can make to drastically reduce muscle mass. But, as I said, I don't wanna be a girl - just a girly guy, I guess. I don't want boobs. I just want to look small, I guess, with mild curve. But I for the life of me can't find out how to achieve that.

A more minor problem - my face. It isn't nearly as bad as the upper body thing, but I have a pretty wide jaw. Obviously nothing can be done about that, so I'd just like advice on how to hide it as well as I can.

Basically, I just want to know where all of you think I should go with this, and to tell me straight-up if you don't think it is possible to do what I want to do. I can take it.

Also if it is relevant, I'm 20. I also suspect that I may be in a bit of delayed puberty. I'm fully grown physically, I think, but I just now got struck with the turbulent emotions and desire to masturbate that are associated with puberty - I never had either before this past month.

"Also she won't write a letter for the passport thing cuz she won't stick her neck out for anyone.

Now, I should say I asked for her to up my dose, and she was going to until she found out that the pro is different. Naturally I assumed that she'd stick with the same dose (she wanted to do blood work on this first) but no.

Since I can't get a hold of her cuz of sleeping problems I had to decide to just... take the prescription and hope it doesn't fuck me up since having nothing definitely will fuck me up.

I had another night of awful sleep, and I think I know why.

It's extremely stressful going to see you.  It's extremely stressful because it sounds like you believe that being trans is a sin, and that I am doing something wrong by choosing to transition.  I get that feeling by your word choice, your tonality.  It just feels wrong.  It doesn't make sense that my sexual identity would be sinful to God.  It would be as if I told you that being a man was a sin, and that you should become a woman.  I doubt you would like it.

Which is why I can't see you today.  I'm not rested.  I'm not ready.  And I'm not sure if I should visit you anymore because I have decided that, yes, I am trans.

Seeing her made me happy, and it gave me hope. A transwoman, IN MY TOWN, WITH A JOB! I was really tempted to try and stop her so I could talk to her. 

Who'd she go to for HRT? How old is she? What was her experience transitioning? 

I wanted to ask her these things. But that would have been rude and I wasn't alone at the time.  

Have you ever met another trans person unexpectedly, especially while in the closet? Did you say anything? ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

I got this feeling that I made a horrible mistake and I got this fear of flunking out. I tried to lay down and clear my head, but all I could do was cry. Could this be hormones affecting me? I am on estradiol, spiro and provera if this helps. Also I have been REALLY run down for the past several weeks. I could sleep all day and night if I didnt have anything to do. Also, I get REALLY tired after eating certain things. Example, I had two buttered bagels on Sunday for Brunch as I was REALLY hungry and hadn't eaten and it was already noon. About an hour later, I just couldnt keep my eyes open. I kept nodding off for a minute or two. Then at some point I think I slept for 20 minutes or more.

"Hey folks. I thought I was only going to use this account to document my SRS recovery but I guess I have a question about something else as well.

A few days ago I went to get a chest X-ray (for SRS, incidentally). It's important to note first that I'm stealth (or at least trying to be - I think I'm mostly successful).

Anyway, while I was waiting the receptionist called to me across the waiting room and asked ""Your other name is [old name] right?"" I suppose she had that written down for whatever reason somewhere and wanted to check that it was me.

I'm fine if she had to check my previous legal name. Y'know, shit happens. But I'm not fine with her basically telling *everyone* in that waiting room that I used to have an unambiguously male name, and therefore pretty much telling everyone that I was trans. I would have preferred it if she called me to the desk. I just replied with ""That is no longer my legal name"" and left it at that.

"Things are happening so fast for me right now .... a few months ago I was worrying about whether or not I ""passed"" and as I'm most often called ""ma'am"" I kinda think I'm doing okay ..... 

I work out every day at a local gym (it's a fairly big one) and the staff know I'm transgender. They've been very accommodating and they open a family locker room for me every time (it's always locked) .... But, as I mentioned in a post a short time ago, the gym director took me aside and said they wanted to change my name to my preferred name and they also wanted to change my gender marker to F ... as they're a chain this new profile will show up at every one I go to .... SO, this was a BIG DEAL for me! Validation!!!!

Then a week ago when I went in the desk attendant was very busy with people waiting in line .... she just looked up, winked, and said, ""you've graduated"" .... And apparently the staff had discussed this earlier and they wanted me to know I was welcome and in fact encouraged to use the Women's Locker Room!  WOOHOO!!!!!

But that's also associated with a LOT of fear and anxiety .... what if someone challenges me, outs me, or complains .... so the first time I went in it was with a fair amount of trepidation .... but I went off to a corner, changed my clothes, and back out fairly quickly .... then I did it the next day and the next day.... each time a bit easier ....

Then comes today ...... I walked right in and put my workout clothes on .... I passed some women I talk with occasionally and they said hi .....  I worked out for an hour and kinda kept my eye out for a time when it wouldn't be busy in there.... and I also watch for when younger girls go in ... if they do I'll wait them out .... that could be way too problematic ....

Anyway .... I went back in to change .... and you guessed it .... the women followed me in .... and they had lockers close to mine ... I had already begun changing and my plan was to slip into the sauna, alone, for a few minutes. As there was no one in there when I went in I ""thought"" I could pull this off .... then the women started getting really chatty .... asking a ton of questions (nothing trans related) .... as I'd already started heading towards the sauna (a towel around my waist and my shorts on but topless) the women said, ""can we join you?"" ***ARE YOU KIDDING ME????? NO - I'M ABOUT READY TO HAVE A STROKE!!!*** But I said ""sure"" .... and we proceeded to the sauna .... they only had towels on which they dropped in the sauna but I kept my towel around my waist .... My voice is my biggest tell at this point, I think (previously a strong baritone).... but I upped the pitch just slightly, sounded a bit raspy (I have a cold right now), and carried on a conversation! 

And I seem to have pulled it off!!! BUT, in hindsight, I don't think this is a good thing ... if they do EVER find out they'll be thinking, *""holy crap - this is a guy and he was in the sauna with us!""* And that would make all the good things about this go horribly bad very fast .....

Anyway .... that's my weekend .....

"Recently (past few months) I have been curious about dating or hooking up with a transgender man because I see them as men (I identify as straight), but I do not think I would have been attracted to them when I identified as gay (before I transitioned).

Possible explanations for my attraction:

1. I just see *transgender men as men* because I realize gender is about more than what's between the legs;

2. I've encountered more trans men and have felt a connection with them because we have a *shared experience* of being transgender;

3. I am attracted to *masculinity and chivalry* and I've noticed trans men tend to be more masculine and chivalrous than other men I've met;

4. I feel like they'd be more respectful and empathetic about my reservations towards using my private parts.

That being said, I dunno whether this qualifies as fetishizing trans men because if it is then I want to develop a healthier relationship with my trans-attraction so as to avoid falling into the mindset/set of behaviors that I despise.

Help? Advice? Judge me, please.

Edit: I said ""I don't think I *would have* been attracted to transgender men when I identified as gay"" because I didn't understand what transgenderism was all about back then and I was closed-minded. 

I said the hypothetical ""would have"" because I was never actually confronted with the question when I identified as gay, so I'm speculating based on my mindset back then.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"hey! so I live in Panama and it took me a really long time to find a doctor that works with trans patients for HRT. My doctor is not an endocrinologist but a gynecologist, and has had a few trans patients in the past. It's what's available so I take it.

He started me only on T-blockers (100 mg spiro /day) last july so it's been a few months. He didn't want to put me on estrogen yet bc something about my liver was wrong from being overweight and taking antidepressants, but I lost like 40 pounds and my levels are fine now so I asked about started estrogen and long story short I started this week!

He started me on 2 mg of estradiol a day. My first question is: is this ok/good/normal? Ideally I would like to feel safe enough with him so that I wouldn't have to ask strangers on the internet but it is what it is.

So, my second question is: i might be paraphrasing but he said that spiro sometimes only blocked the testosterone produced in the prostate and not the one produced by the testicles. He asked me to find out if other trans women take something to stop the testosterone produced by the testicles. He mentioned something about DIANE 35, but after a short google search I stumbled upon a susans post about why that's not a good option. I emailed him that link.

I have some friends that have been prescribed just spiro and estradiol and that seems to be enough but I'm still curious about what he said and if there's any truth to it.

Planning on going to see a gender therapist, but I want to present my situation to reddit.

--

I don't know what to do. I am terrified, confused, panicking. I feel trapped and I am having a hard time not giving in to thoughts of this being impossible.

I have known since I was 15 I am transgender. I have fought it every step of the way even through a six year enlistment in the Air Force when I was an aircraft electrician. The dysphoria got harder and harder to fight every time it cropped up. I got out of the military in 2013, and over the last month... I gave up the fight. I gave in. I accepted it. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made, and I just wish I would have done it sooner.

I was born and raised in San Jose, California but through the machinations of life ended up in a tiny town in Tennessee with about 1000 people. A town where a gay man was found hung from a telephone line in the 90s, where people hang black scarecrows from their trees as Halloween decorations, even this last Halloween. 

I am an industrial mechanic. I work in field service on air compressors and compressed air equipment. I am very good at my job. I have a stellar reputation at work; I am one of the go-to technicians when problems and weird things come up with machinery. I also LOVE my job. I love field service. I drive a work truck from job to job and dictate my own schedule, mostly. 

But it is in the South. Tennessee is one of the most trans-unfriendly states in the US. There is ZERO gender identity protection at work. My company is, however, a progressive worldwide company who has a robust and inclusive LGBT support program and their company policy DOES protect against gender identity discrimination. 

But, since I work in field service on air compressors... I go all over the state. From Nashville which is a liberal island in the area to auto shops and manufacturing plants located in or near small towns and VERY conservative areas. Thinking about customers I have been to, I can count several where I can promise you the customer would immediately refuse to either do business with us or refuse to allow me to do my job and service/repair their equipment.

My situation is complex. I am living in a house that my mom left me with (largely against my will) after my step dad died suddenly, without warning, two years ago. My mom has never worked and had no intentions of working, and she shacked up with a new guy within a year who would pamper her and allow her to live without working. I can't summon the energy to just leave the house and leave her with the payments. It's a double-wide trailer that is falling apart, and while I make far more than enough money to afford a decent apartment in Nashville, I can't bring myself to screw my mom over like that.

I have a four year old daughter who lives two states away with her mother. I pay something like 650 dollars a month in child support. That is a fixed cost I will have for the next 14 years. That makes it nearly impossible for me to even entertain the idea of going to college despite having the GI bill. I have literally NO other experience besides that of a mechanic and I have never been to college, ever.

I just feel trapped and I don't know what to do. I want to transition so badly. I am addicting to /r/transtimelines and trans youtubers and all I do is daydream. I want this so badly. Fifteen years of repressed feelings and desires is just... now that it's out. It's hard to keep it all in. 

Luckily my girlfriend is totally cool with all of this, and the few friends I have come out to are totally cool and understanding and awesome with it. I haven't talked to my dad in years and my mom is probably going to be okay with it. So I feel very fortunate for that. But the work situation. I don't know what to do with that. 

The only thing I can think of to do is go see a gender therapist and talk about all of this, which I DO plan on doing. And luckily the VA hospital here will do hormone therapy should I decide that I can risk that.

I sometimes feel I only wish I were born a girl because of my crossdressing habit. I'd much rather wear women's clothes in public, but because I was born male it looks weird to others.

"I am looking for things that I can do to help me feel more feminine when I am at work. I am always in full boy-mode at work, mostly for convenience, and also because I'd rather not have to deal with ""coming out"" at work. What are some things I can do in secret to help me feel more feminine?

I currently: 

* shave my legs (though maybe I could use some pointers on this, I'm having razor burn issues I think)
* Nail polish on my toes
* Women's panties every day, though mostly because I find them more comfortable

Any other ideas? Thanks!",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I woke up this morning, had some pain in my right side, by 1 it was well nigh unbearable so i go down to the car, then realize i needed to shave ( was supposed to have electrolysis today ) shaved and headed to the hospital- for what turned out to be a kidney stone.

I go to the room and change into the hospital gown, and i am lying on the table. The nurse comes in and asks me some questions, ii answer her with pain level 8-9 hurts from my chest down to my groin. She goes "" ohh it hurts from your vagina up to your chest?"". I was "" I am not quite there yet"". Her eyes went wide and she ran to the computer looks and says "" But it says &lt;female name&gt; here, I am so sorry about that !"" and she is super distressed about it.

I explained that an incredible compliment and took her hand and said thank you. After she left i started crying because because despite the pain i was so happy. ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"So, I've been on 12,5mg Cypro (switching to 25mg soon) since a week or so now, but not estrogen yet. I had a blood test and my T-levels before I started were around 480ng/dl which I think is pretty normal for a male.

I'm feeling pretty good (don't know if it's a placebo effect, but I'll take it. Stupid morning and spontaneous erections are gone too -yay!-). One thing that really bugs me is my hairloss though. 

I definitely have male pattern hair loss. Judging from some graphs and figures it's a beginner stage M-shape male pattern hair loss.

Not going to post a picture of myself because I'd die of shame, but it's similar to this picture I found on google. It's been like this for a few years, thinning -very- slowly over time, especially on the front. No hair loss on top or at the back though. It's still pretty thick there. 

http://hairloss.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hair-loss-grading-system.jpg

I read it's a big YMMV thing to expect hair regrowth, especially on those spots, so I'm going to (for sanity reasons) assume it's not going to come back on its own.

What's the probability for hair regrowth on its own? It's basically a miracle if it happens, right?
Is it enough to bring my T-levels into female range to stop further hair loss? 
Would it help to add finasteride to my HRT?
What are my options to restore hair? 
Is this easy to hide with long hair?
Has anyone bought hair implants? 
How expensive would they be for this kind of hair?

I'm sorry about these dumb questions, but this is the one thing that's really freaking me out beyond reason.

I have a girlfriend who just moved to Ontario, Canada from Mexico, where she was already on HRT (you don't need anything written to get it, just buy it) and she's stressed out because she only has like a months worth of hormones and has no idea how to get them in Canada.

"I have a close friend (who is cis- somewhat relevant) that I regularly get into arguments with about medical authority in the trans community. What I mean by this: he believes that needing approval from a doctor to switch your gender (on legal documents) is wrong. He admits needing medical approval for HRT or surgeries makes sense- but only insofar as is needed to ensure no adverse physical effects, not to judge if the person is actually trans. Basically, he thinks any situation in which medical authority is used to try and determine if someone is trans or not is morally questionable.

I actually don't like that point of view, and I'm a bit twisted up about it because I have in the past taken shortcuts (diy-ing hormones) and I feel really guilty about it-- internally I viewed it as a form of self-harm and although it helped, I felt like I'd betrayed myself in desperation. Therapy has healed this somewhat, but I still don't believe my friend has the right of it. Some sort of diagnosis, word from authority, feels right to me. And yet I'm not sure this isn't some kind of internalized bias. What do you all think? To what degree is medical authority needed in the trans* community?",gender_dysphoria_disorder

The navy (thankfully) is allowing people who are closeted transgender to not only openly come out, they'll pay for it. People are expected to treat you with the dignity and respect you deserve as a united states sailor regardless of how they feel about your decision.

Should you be diagnosed with gender dysphoria they'll pay for your entire transition. All the way to GRS (should you choose to go that route). The rules following this were you had to be diagnosed by a navy doctor, and you were seen (by navy dress and PT standards) as your birth gender until all the legal paperwork said otherwise. Easy enough right?

However, one thing got people (auditorium of about 500) standing up in protest. That should you choose not to go the route of GRS but still go through with transitioning, if all the legal documents were in order you would be seen as your preferred gender. Regardless of anatomy.

"So, I started seeing a therapist (yay!) and in my first meeting I explained to her that I've been severely questioning my gender. Her initial approach was maybe it is caused by close friends also doing so and I'm simply following herd mentality- which made sense in my head. To help figure this out, she asked me to start graphing my days on a scale of my choosing. I decided to do 1-10 where 1 is most masculine and 10 is most feminine. She also told me to continue doing research.

Well, lately, I've been in a mindset where I am simultaneously certain that I am somewhere on the transgender spectrum but also scared shitless about where and how to deal with it. In any case, I'm nervous that through my research I've created confirmation bias due to this conclusion. 

Of course, then the problem I run into there is the question of why I would have already come to that conclusion and to that the only logical answer I have is because I would innately know that conclusion is correct to some degree. 

Either way, I am curious, does anyone else on here have this problem? Does everyone sort of just go through the ""what if this is confirmation bias"" thing? Or am I going insane. Thanks!",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Hey peeps! I've been a lurker here (on a different account) for a while now. I guess I'm finally ready to start admitting to myself that this whole transgender thing (MtF) might actually be a part of me. There are a few specific things I'd like to ask, but I want to preface it with the reasons I think I may be trans, and the feelings I've been having. Not entirely because it's super relevant, but because It'll hopefully feel good to get it off my chest. It's also four AM (as of when I started writing, who knows what time it'll be when I'm finished) and I haven't gotten a wink of sleep so I'm crossing my fingers that this will be coherent and not just some poorly written continuous stream of sleep deprived thought.

A brief bio: I'm eighteen years old, and a freshman in college starting on my second semester. I'm currently a Music Ed Major, but I'm thinking about switching to Language Arts Education after this semester for a ton of reasons unrelated to this.

And on to the story.

As a child, I naturally gravitated towards other girls. There was actually a photo of me from preschool that I used to have, where I was drawing rainbows with chalk on the asphalt of the playground with the other girls in my class, while the guys were playing some sport; unfortunately I don't have it anymore because in middle school I was embarrassed by it so I crumpled it up and threw it away. At family gatherings I would always spend my time with my grandma, aunts, and mother over spending it with any of the guys in my family. It wasn't until the peer pressure kicked in around third grade that I started hanging out with guys by choice, with a few exceptions. There was actually a time in second grade, while my mother was pregnant with my little sister, where I asked her if she could sleep on her tummy while she was pregnant. She responded no, and I was disappointed because I slept on my stomach, and that when I got pregnant one day I would have to change the way I slept. Then I realized I couldn't get pregnant. I remember starting to read those Tamora Pierce books around fourth and fifth grade, imagining myself as a fierce heroine like the characters in them. I remember hitting puberty, and having most of my sexual fantasies being ones where I was a woman, whether it be by some magic spell in some far away fantasy land (dorky middle school me lol), by futuristic technology, or fantasies where I simply was a girl. I also remember teasing and making fun of my guy friends whenever they'd express any sort of femininity in middle and high school. As a side note I'm not really that feminine myself, and if I were to transition one day I'd still probably feel the most comfortable in some flannel, jeans, and boots. Not really a cross-dressing person, whether it's just not my thing or it's a little bit of unwarranted self-disgust. I did used to put on my older sister's bra as a kid though in later elementary school when she'd leave it in the bathroom. I wasn't the most friendly to the concept of someone being transgender back when I was still in high school, whether it was picked up from my family or from some internalized transphobia I don't know. I would laugh in my head whenever the idea of transgendered people crossed my mind, thinking things like ""well I fantasize about being a girl, and get along better with girls, and I'm not transgendered so they must be making it up to feel like special snowflakes. Just people with too much time on their hands."" I know horrible, right? The cringe is real. Thankfully I've still got growing in life to do and have a chance to be a better person. A few months ago I questioned if I was transgender for the first time. I laughed it off at initially, but the idea kept persisting in my head that I might be. So I did some research, and realized that there's nothing shameful or wrong with being transgender. More time passed, and eventually I subbed to /r/transgender and here just to ease my mind and convince myself that I'm not really transgender. But the opposite happened. So here I am, with my most inner secret posted on a public website. If there was a button I could push to change genders, I'd be running to it and slamming my hand down. But there isn't, because of course life has got to make things complicated.

TL;DR: The usual stuff I guess.

So here's to the questions now.

1. I want to be a teacher. If I were to transition would that hurt my prospects of being employed, especially in more conservative parts of the country?
2. How many of y'all decide not to transition? I think I can live in my body and be content enough with my life, of course that could very well change over time I guess.
3. If I decide to not transition or come out of the closet due to the fiscal, social, and other concerns and costs involved can I still really call myself transgender, if that's what I am, or should I just move on in life and try to put it all behind me?
4. My family is very important to me, but I don't know if they'd understand fully. Especially if I came out and (in theory) transitioned during college, I'm worried they'd withdraw their financial support of my education (not that it's a whole lot but it's enough to hurt if it were gone). Would it be better to wait until I'm completely financially independent before I come out, if I ever do?

"So for the last 2-3 months I've been suffering from crippling dysphoria (I've been lurking/posting here ~10h a day during that time to keep myself calm.)


However, the past day or two i've felt weirdly content, i've been relatively ok with everything.  I still have the usual stuff going through my head, but it's not upsetting/confusing to think about as it has been, I feel like I just don't have an opinion/emotional response to what im thinking.


This may seem like a good thing and I suppose it should, it means I can try and get on with life and stop being consumed by the whole trans side of me, which makes logical sense as it should only be a small part of my life and shouldn't define who I am.


Although i've seen countless similar threads in all my time here, I can't help but feel a little concerned.  I plan on starting HRT this month and nothing is going to change that.  I'm also aware i'm not going to feel ok forever and things are certainly going to resurface, I just don't know when.

"So, hi everyone! 

I've been going through a lot of confusion and self-doubt over the last few years and the last 2 weeks in particular and I'm still not entirely sure what I want. I've been having those feelings since the beginning of puberty and I just suprressed it...over the years those feelings came back periodically, each time triggerd by certain events...and each time I felt worse. The thought of wanting to be female never really went away but it got quiet so that I could live normally.

A few weeks back, those thoughts and feelings kicked in again and I felt really damn bad...but I didn't want to supress it this time, because I finally wanted to get what was wrong. The last two weeks of december where just full of being in conflict with myself, thinking about what may or may not be. 

...and I came to the semi-conclusion that I might be trans, but I'm still not 100% sure about that because I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is dysphoria...I mean if I could swap my gender right here and now, I would do it without any doubt, but it does not feel like a screaming voice in my head that tells me that I should be female, but I still fear that if I don't do something about it that this whole thing gets worse over the years and I don't think that I could live with this feeling all my life. I am 20 now and I feel like it's not too late yet and that I can still do something about it, but I'm still not 100% sure if this is what I want to do.

I have been an introvert person all my life, have social anxiety to some degree and I'm missing the ""engine"" to start or finish stuff and got a really small depression (not thaaat bad and managable, never had thoughts about suicide and am pretty much neutral atm) and my day basically consists of escaping into videogames and listening to music...I also never had any kind of relationship and I think that it could be because I just can't really picture myself as a male in a relationship and I feel like all of these issues could be connected to the fact that I am conflicted about who I am.

I am going to therapy at the beginning of next month and am scared as hell, because I don't really know where to start and where to go from here and how my future will turn out. At this point I can't really admit that I'm trans because I am still not entirely sure about it, but still I can't say that I'm not trans, because of all of this. 

Have I already accepted it but something keeps holding me back to admit it? I mean, goddamnit I already have ""settled"" on a name I really like, so why am I still hesitant to admit what's wrong?
Has anyone gone through something similar? (stupid question...i think there are a lot here)
How did therapy go for you? I never talked to a psychologist before, only when I was in elementary school because I had far too much energy.
How did you came to the conclusion or acceptance of being trans? What held you back and how did you get over it?

I'm currently stuck in a loop and just needed to write down my thoughts, since I'm in kind of a clear mindstate right now...and sorry for the long text &lt;3

"Iâ€™ve been very reluctant to write something like this because Iâ€™m new to the community and I donâ€™t want any of my observations or thoughts to come across as presumptive. Still, in case it has any meaning for any of you, Iâ€™d like to take the opportunity to share a bit of my perspective and I hope I can express it as respectfully as possible. 

Understanding gender identity and presentation and how it relates to my past and present life is relatively new to me, and Iâ€™m in the midst of dealing with the implications even as they seem to continue to grow larger and burrow deeper. This is actually welcome, in a way, because as painful as it is, the incomprehensible despair that preceded it was worse. I acknowledge that pain is something that many of us probably share, here, and the suicide statistics in the community are a devastating testament.

When Iâ€™ve observed reactions from trans people perceiving a positive response from others upon becoming aware that theyâ€™re trans, I often see a lot of negativity. To me, there are a least a couple of reasons why this is understandable, and Iâ€™m sure there are plenty more! The first that comes to mind is personal safety: unless this other person is a close friend, trans people face a lot of risks and trust needs to be earned and motives questioned until then. The second is a deeper and more nebulous reason, and I hope my explanation will make at least a bit of sense: acknowledging that something positive can come from a process that was and is so deeply painful can feel terribleâ€”as if that very pain would somehow be negated or erased. But often the pain is so keenly felt that this cannot hold and the pain wins and the positive is dismissed. 

Iâ€™ve no idea if this resonates with any of you, but if it does, it might suggest that thereâ€™s a way forward to accept more positivity into oneâ€™s life. In either case, what I really wanted to share with all of you is what I see:

When I see gender expression that strikes me as obviously genuine, or when I learn that someone is trans, what I see is someone whoâ€™s faced incredible adversity and has likely suffered deeply as theyâ€™ve taken heroic measures to stop the catastrophic trainwreck of their lives. I say heroic because many of us consider suicide and the decision to persist is not fucking obvious. Theyâ€™ve gotten down to one of the last, hardest choices in life and have said, â€œI have no choiceâ€. Then they do it. 

Do you not see how utterly impressive that is? Can you not imagine why others might be attracted to someone capable of such intense and deliberate personal growth and transformation? Iâ€™m fucking *blown away*.

"Today, I felt pretty good... until I went out to eat. I pass, really well, and always have, been stealth for years. But, today, today my perceptions got thrown in a flux.

At first I thought nothing of it, just some lady and a kid that needed a little extra help. But then, suddenly, they were talking loud enough for me to hear them. I don't know if this was directed at me, but I'm paranoid, I couldn't tell if she was looking at me or past me when her gaze shifted from left to center. I almost felt like I was the joke, from how she was laughing, but I don't know. This is what I recall:

To the maybe 15 year old girl: ""Oh, you mean, like, it wasn't a woman? They found out *it* was really a guy wearing women's clothing?""

Child: ""Yeah.""

Woman: ""Oh yeah, those men, it's creepy and weird, wearing women's clothing and going into the women's bathroom. I don't get it, it's weird."" *she makes a disgusted, disapproving scowl*

Child: *inaudible*

The older woman laughs obnoxiously as the girl says she had a similar experience with ""a guy in the girls room"".

The thing is though, I don't think it was her kid, because she said, ""stay here and finish eating, I need to go out and call my husband."" So basically, her she is, reinforcing this sort of hate/negativity to a kid with special needs. All if it makes me sick to my stomach.

"So, I have kind of a complicated situation I could use some advice on. 

I came out of the closet in 2012 about being trans to my immediate family and some of my friends and a period before I was planning on moving out of state. It was a wonderful and fortunate experience as I was accepted and loved by all my family and didn't lose a single friend and it did a lot to help me gain a lot of willpower to overcome some crippling issues with avoidant behaviors and social phobias. Then I moved out of state and moved in with my boyfriend, ready to start a new life for ourselves with a long term goal of transitioning but no real precise plan. Unfortunately, I kind of went back into the closet out of fear after losing a lot of that will power when some of my plans didn't pan out. 
I've recently decided that in order to get anything done I need to regain that willpower by facing down the fears I have about being out to my boyfriend's family, who still see us as a couple of guys. I haven't had a whole lot of willpower as of late to even start *thinking* about how in the world I am going to pull off transition and a lot of that is because my network of social support is two time zones away. I've come to believe that I would have a whole lot more will power if I had a geographically closer network of support, plus it would be a great excersize in courage building to just come out to these people. 
I have only known them for a handful of years, they are my boyfriend's family and he's known them his whole life and they are all very close. He claims no one would reject me if I was out to any of them, but I told him years ago that I wanted to be the one to come out to them and didn't want him to out me and he's respected that wish for years. I have already been accepted into their family, but as a man, and have spent a number of years trying to build relationships with all of them, aunts, uncles, siblings, cousins, nieces and nephews, all of them. But I've always been intimidated by them because I am back in the closet with them. I still struggle with what I know are irrational fears of ruining my boyfriends relationship with them by being out. He has said that in the possibility that such an event would happen he would defend me and stick by me if it meant cutting himself off from some of his family, but that honestly just makes things a lot more complicated and scarier. I need to face this fear myself, and I need to get these people on my side. This seems a lot harder than what I did in 2012 because I do not know these people as well as the ones from back then, because back then those were people I had known my whole life and I knew how to gauge them. 
Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Has anyone found themselves needing to come out to a family of a partner, people who are sort of strangers? How do I approach this? How do I approach this in a way that builds courage? What is your advice? ",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"On the verge of transition I find myself having alot of emotions running trough me. I always ran from that shit. But now I have to deal with it and I don't have it all figured out in advance. 

Atleast in the closet everything that went out had to be thought about and pre-approved. Not great for being spontaneous, but I liked the sense of control it gave. Now it's like there is no filter. Now I find myself f.inst acting angry when Im angry. Like wtf?! I thought I had that emotion shit wrapped up tight and fully tamed...

Im just so scared I will blurt out some dumb shit about something Im going trough and someone will take it the wrong way and think it's about them.

Especially when talking to other trans people. Im just walking on eggshells there.

When does this pre-transition freak out period end? It's exhausting and mentally I feel like an akward 16 year old in many ways.

It feels like learning how to ski, and to do that I guess you have to fall on your ass a few times. I don't like falling on my ass.

"So last night I was meeting up with a friend of mine at a barcade in the Castro in San Francisco. I was walking to the place, about a block away and wrapped up in my own thoughts, when I realized that a drunk bro I had just walked past was yelling, ""YOU'RE A MAN! YOU'RE A MAN!""

It was kind of surreal. I've read so many stories, but for the first time I was experiencing a stranger go out of their way to confront me about my gender identity. For a moment, I was confused as to what emotion I should be feeling in response. Should I get upset? Should I get angry? Should this ruin my night?

Then, I started laughing. My first time getting harassed was *in the fucking Castro*. This neighborhood is the center of the queer universe, and was plastered with rainbow flags as far as the eye could see. Did this guy get lost? Did he know where he was? HOW DID YOU END UP HERE, MYSTERY BRO?

Then I realized just how totally absurd it would have been anywhere. This guy got worked up to the point of screaming over a random passing stranger who has nothing to do with his life whatsoever. That doesn't even make any sense. I started laughing harder.

I'm still laughing. Yell all you want, weirdo. I have a date with a pint of beer and a game of Joust.

"Hi reddit! This is my first (mobile) post and I need some help with a somewhat newly* discovered fetish my boyfriend of 5 years has. 

The other night my phone dies and I'm bored (he was playing vidja games). So I use his phone to look up ""games"" and the first thing that pops up in recent search history is something along the lines of struggling with a trans identity / being gay. My heart starts to hurt because he's never communicated with me about these feelings or even his cross dressing in over a year. Naturally I start looking through his history (I know... I know) and there were countless pornhub sissy searches, dildo searches, sex toy searches, chastity, and tucking. The next morning I confront him about the one search about being gay and his answer was basically that he's been into women since he was born and -basically- I have nothing to worry about. 


So my question is.. where do I go from here? How do I be as supportive as possible? It's hard for me to try and understand without having a panic attack that I'm never going to sexually fulfill him and he's going to leave me because I'm a cis woman. We haven't tried anything in bed yet but I am open and willing to try anything!

"I just wanted to take the time while contemplating on the toilet to say to all of you that you are worth it.

No one lives life without struggles. No one lives life without heartbreak or failure in some capacity. But please remember this: you are not alone. Whether you're at the beginning of your trans-journey, sailing through the center of the storm, or watching someone else you love go through this hardship, there will always be someone out there who understands what you're going through. Life is hard, but not exclusively. We can grow stronger together. Where one of us is weaker, another will have the strength to compensate.

You don't have to be perfect, just be you. The world needs a ""you"". Though insignificant you may feel at times, the tiniest thing can make a difference for someone. Your efforts will not go unnoticed. You are known. You are loved.

To those of you who have reached that beautiful nirvana of self-love and acceptance: congratulations! To those of you still striving for that: we believe in you, even if you don't always believe in yourself. Things do and will get better. And to everyone connected to this community: thank you. Your love and acceptance has changed countless lives. Keep up the good work.

"Hello you wonderful people, 

I need some advice in the area of bedroom romance.

My partner and I have been together for coming on a year now. I'm a 26 yr old cis-woman and my girlfriend is 23 yr old trans-woman. We have a great relationship, I work in the tech industry and my girlfriend is finishing her degree in psychology. We have two cats and rent a downtown apartment in a very pro lgbt community. So things on the home front are good, just wanted to get that out of the way.

We're both into kink and up until recently have been pretty active in the community. My partner has started making comments about experiencing genital dysphoria so we've pulled back to get things figured out. My girlfriend has been in her transition for about 7 months now. We both have small frames, I'm about 5ft3 and she's 5ft5, both under 130lbs and present femme. 

My partner still enjoys penetrative sex and we're started talking about different words to communicate her needs so that I dont make her feel self-conscious unintentionally. I've always been more dominating in the bedroom and I also enjoy dirty talk, so this was a super important thing to figure out. 

How do I perform oral in a way that will make her feel feminine? As I said, she doesn't mind penetration, so most of the time I ride her clit because it the only way I can get off and she likes me taking control of her orgasm. But the last couple of times I've tried to perform oral on her she stops me. She said she wants me to treat her more like a girl, I'm not sure how to do this. I'm very dominating in the bedroom and she's in a sub role. I've tried approaching from different positions. I almost make her cum by sitting straddled ontop of her thighs while she's laying on her back, I push her clit down flat against her stomach and focus strictly on the head. I have an oral fetish so I sometimes get too enthusiastic but I just want to make her cum.

As i've said, penetration wise, she's still comfortable penetrating me but she doesn't like the motions of receiving head. 

How do you handle this? how would you want your partner to perform oral on you in a way that wont mess with gender dysporia? ",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"My STBX cis spouse and I are planning to split due to irreconcilable differences around sexuality and gender. We would like to remain the best of friends, because we've shared everything together and are already the best of friends.

As they suffer from depression and anxiety, I've agreed to not dress fully as I wish until sometime within a future (but fixed) timeframe, as well as wait to do things like move out, split finances, do legal documentation, etc, until they feel more ready. They are quite distraught about the whole thing, and wish that things would have worked out between us. And basically, say that everything was perfect except for the gender.

So in the ideal situation, I would be able to be supportive as always. But yesterday, after looking too long at my face and becoming disgusted, then wishing I had been born with my preferred body parts, when talking with them I basically unleashed bitterness that while I've always managed to handle their problems, they couldn't do this one thing, and now I still have to refrain from doing certain things to make them ok enough, when everything else was fine and we never had successful PIV anyways (and only a few failed attempts) so who really cares.

Like sure, if you don't want to be in such a relationship, fine, then we'll have a nice easy split and be happy enough about it, but then why are you so miserable you won't be in our relationship any more? This is what I don't get, because isn't being able to express your (hetero, in this case) sexuality supposed to make you happy, not sad and miserable?

I don't know how to stop feeling bitter about this at times and I like being mean :( Either I need to understand their position enough (and I get it superficially, but not enough to not care), or be able to suppress this negativity for long enough until I don't risk blasting them with it.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Hi guys,

I'm 30. Married, two kids. Posted here before with a different throwaway questioning whether or not I *am* trans, but I've come to the conclusion that yeah, I'm an AMAB woman.

I don't know what I'm going to do about it. My dysphoria isn't terrible. I can avoid it. I can ignore it. I hate shaving, I hate cutting my hair, I hate having my picture taken and I hate looking in mirrors but if I can avoid those things then I can just remember that I'm me, and not let my body define me. I'm a pretty feminine guy all things considered. I'm the stay-at-home dad, the kids primary caregiver. I don't exist outside of the house a whole lot. Gender presentation doesn't totally matter.

I know I'd be happier in a female body, with or without GCS, and that my depression and my anxiety are probably at least in part due to this, but I've learned to live with my brain. I can still live a happy, thriving life as a man. I still fantasize about waking up one day as a woman, just like that, with everything the same otherwise, but...

I'm scared, I guess. Not of what parents or friends or anything think, screw them, screw their opinions. It's my wife. I honestly don't know how she would react. Last year when Jeffrey Tambor won the Emmy we got to talking about transitions later in life and she said ""Well, if that were my husband, I'd feel betrayed. I'd feel like he'd been keeping a secret from me the whole time we were married."" That kind of hit me hard. Didn't really know how to respond. I've been keeping it a secret from myself, too, you know? I've only just come to terms with how I feel myself.

I don't know, if she were *actually* put in that position, would she take it that way? We've been together seven years, married five, have had two little girls together, she's my everything. She's my rock, my support, my strength. We have a wonderful relationship and talk about everything and nothing.

Except this. Because I'm so scared that it's just going to upend our whole life and I'll wind up out on the street with limited access to my kids and just wasting away trying to find money for HRT. Telling her could be throwing my whole life away. Keeping the status quo isn't the end of the world. I'm happy enough, I just know I could be more happy if I was myself, my proper self.

"Two weeks ago I made [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5le9iv/fuck_it_im_coming_out_to_my_mom_next_time_were/)

TL;DR: I'm 16, trans girl, and live in a very conservative family. For most of the time I've known my trans I've kind of accepted that I'll just come out after high school but after realizing how lucky I am for not having a very masculine body yet, I don't want to wait and potentially get fucked over by being a ""late bloomer."" However, there's no way in hell I'm straight-up coming out to my family. Since I have a pediatrician appointment coming up this month, I decided I'd tell my mom in a very general way that I'm unhappy with my body and want to talk about it with our doctor, so that I can't be blamed by my parents if the worst case scenario happens and they're totally opposed (I'm a good student and I don't need that distraction).

So I did it. For some reason I was so fucking nervous even though I wasn't saying anything specific. Me and my mom are watching the Texans vs Patriots playoff game right now (she has no idea what I'm typing right now lol) so I just up and said during a commercial break that I want to talk to our doctor about how I haven't been feeling like I've been growing right when we have the appointment.

Of course, my mom thought I was talking in terms of not being masculine *enough,* but I went with it. My mom genuinely cares and loves me, so she was very supportive and said to never be afraid to tell her anything (however she still thinks I'm a nice Catholic boy and not a foulmouthed atheist trans girl sooooo). The most specific thing I said was that I felt like I was *too* tall: she didn't get that since I'm 5'8 (probably the most masculine thing about me now, but I'm fine with it if I don't grow any more) and average for boys my age, but I moved past it quickly.

It feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest even if I didn't say anything specific. I've literally never told anyone this before in person.

It basically went as good as possible. My mom was very happy that I told her (she just thinks of it in a ""not boy enough way"" so I won't take it as assurance about my trans-ness yet), so now that she has the idea in her head she'll have an expectation about what my doctor might say about it.

Which'll help because I'm fucking saying it at the appointment.

It's happening, dudes (dudes is gender-neutral). I'm fucking saying it to my doctor this Tuesday. The mom-thing went as well as could be expected, so worst-case scenario is that my mom thinks it's bullshit and gets mad at my doctor and not me.

I also don't want it to seem like I'm being a dick (cunt?) to my parents or anything. Like I said, they love me and I feel the same. I'm just worried that they love the facade (and that goes beyond just being trans, I'm literally the antithesis of everything they stand for and they don't know it) I put on more than they would love the actual me. But I feel like my mom at least would be more sympathetic and support me unconditionally, so I'm optimistic.

For better or for worse, my life is changing on Tuesday. Wish me luck! Luckily, I have studying for midterms to do to distract me from the nerves.

Note: these posts aren't asking for advice, or anything. I just like writing down my thoughts. Maybe I'll look back at this one day and be glad that I did this early. And if it helps out anyone going through the same thing it's worth sharing.",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"This is more of a venting thing, but I need an outlet.

I've fought hard for being who I am today, sure everyone genders me female, people see me as a woman, all my docs are female, hormones have made a good work with me, which is nice and all.

But I feel like my life is lacking direction. I feel alone most of the time, purposeless and powerless. Kind of like there's no reason for me to actually be here on this Earth, you know? And I don't say this in a suicidal way but more in a ""What am I here for?"" Kind of way.

I'm having to drop out of college temporarily to focus on my business and save up some money for projects I want to do, as well as a bit of traveling around the country. Something tells me it'd be a good idea. But this decision hurts my ego a bit as I'm almost 25 and I've done nothing that can really be considered important with my life. Then again my current business makes me more money than what I can make living here in Mexico. This country sucks, especially for trans people.

Sure, I transitioned into my true self, but I'm FAR from being the best version I can be and I haven't done enough. I still can't get over my binge eating disorder, I still feel like I lack confidence in myself, I havenâ€™t had an actual loving relationship since 2013 and I feel lonely as fuck. 

I feel like Iâ€™ve gone nowhere and Iâ€™m stuck. 

Not sure if therapy can actually work for me, some people have suggested antidepressants but messing with my brainâ€™s chemistry is something I donâ€™t look forward to. 

What can I do to better myself? At what point do I find someone who will actually compliment me and make me feel like Iâ€™m actually alive and worth loving? At what time do I actually get to love myself and stay consistent to become the best version I want to be of my true self?

"Hello. I haven't been here much. Just recently have I started posting a bit, but mostly lurking. I mainly used this sub when I came out around two years ago now. This is quite long, but I would appreciate anyone who takes the time to read through and respond. 

Basically it created a huge shitstorm, and my life has been mostly very bland and I've been depressed a lot. My anxiety has spiked as well. My mom has said a lot of hurtful things to me, and my confidence in myself as a girl is extremely low. I have to work hard just to not think of myself as a freak.

Anyway, I've wanted to transition for quite a while now. I've just recently gone to a clinic where they gave me papers for bloodwork and said that I could see an endocrynologist in a month if I have a letter of reccomendation from my therapist.

Now, he says I have to express my feelings more, and describe what it feels like to be a woman. This panics me.

I've been up and down throughout the years of feeling so strongly about being a girl, then feeling like shit about, then just feeling empty. I feel like I've gone so far down in supressing my feelings just to get through life that they are gone.

Now I feel very doubtful of myself. For example, my mom recently came to me (presumably after seeing my clinic form that I left in the printer) with an ugly picture of me from middle school when I was most masculine, and very ugly, at least in my opinion. She asked, ""Where did he go?"" In reference to me.

I feel ashamed of myself then because seemed like such a boy, and I don't recall being dysphoric AT ALL. I just know I had sexual feelings with girl's clothes, and sometimes had feelings to draw girls or play as them in games, for whatever reason. It's really quite embarassing, and it makes me feel invalid.

It's like I just don't know. I feel so uncomfortable with the thought of being a girl now. I feel I will only be a fake, or that I have convinced myself lf this, or that I'm just a confused guy. I'm at the point where it's so exhausting that I'd rather just not be anything than be a girl.

It's so confusing because I've felt very happy about the idea of being a girl, even crying about it. Now it's just gone. So I don't know if it really was just a phase or whatever. I don't know.

TL;DR: I can't find my feelings of wanting to be a girl anymore, I just feel numb, which makes me anxious and depressed.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"I often think of how much I feel like I've only lived half a life or wasted what part of me lived as a male (I'm MtF) and wish I had just been born female. But I like to try to find the good in my past also!

For me it's looking back at my childhood and thinking that growing up as a ""male"" allowed me to explore hobbies that I enjoyed without being told that it was something that ""girls aren't supposed to do"" because of the shittiness of society. (Granted there are TONS of things I wish I could have done but couldn't do them because of the opposite as well, but trying to keep positive!) I honestly don't know if I would have the same hobbies and the type of skills that I have now and enjoy if I didn't grow up the way I did, and now I can still enjoy them as who I am (aka a girl)!

I really just want to try to stop looking at my past with nothing but regret and I'm sure the same feelings are a weight that many of us carry and wanted to try to look at the positives for once instead!

"Hi everyone. I'm posting on a throwaway because I do not want the folks who follow my main account to know who I am.

I'm just over 8 months on HRT and a year on blockers. I'm still part-time but looking to go full-time this summer. Coming out to those close to me just over a year ago cost me my partner of almost a decade and all of my friends. I knew things would not go well but I always felt things would get better over time. While I have made a few new friends and been on some dates since then I'm still feeling quite alone. I haven't been able to connect with the people I've been on dates with and I feel like the few new friends I have made don't have time for me (which is mostly true). It as if all the new connections I've made with people are shallow.

I'm finding myself spending lots of time alone and simply shut off from the world, similar to how I was before coming out. I simply don't know what to do. To the people I interact regularly see my as a happy, bubbly person so they would have no idea how disconnected I feel, hence the throwaway. I had a therapist about 2-3 years ago but I did not get any benefit from our sessions and she ended up disappearing on me after about a year of meeting regularly. After she closed up her office and stopped responding to messages was about the time I came out.

Growing up I never knew what I wanted from life. Since being on this journey, I've found I very much want a normal life. Married to a partner who loves me, 2.5 kids and a house in the suburbs. I'm starting to feel like that will never happen and I will always be alone. I don't know what to do. I just... I don't know.",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"so I'm a 30 something trans woman, pre-hrt, appointment made but in a country where you have to wait months. 

So yesterday a girlfriend came over we talked a bit, she's poly and talked about her relations. This generally makes me sad because I've never had a relation. Apparently it showed because she asked me about it, and it was like some door got opened that should stay closed, I got emotional, I didn't want to get emotional but I just couldn't stop it, on the brink of tears and not being able to talk because then the dam would burst, and I didn't want to tell her, didn't want to break in front of her. 

I think somewhere in puberty it started, discovering that I couldn't socialize, that it was easier to be alone then be around other people. I had friends. First my childhood friends, the typical bar/party going teenagers. But they started making fun of me, and I stopped hanging out with them. Then sort of overlapping I met a bunch of nerd friends, playing magic and dungeons and dragons. Then early adult hood I started working. Software engineer. I was good at my job so things went well, I lost touch with my nerd friends. I knew my social life was a mess, but I just managed it, pushed trough, and focused on my work. In a couple of instances I looked for love, but never found it. 

And over those years this all just accumulated in this self-image that I'm just tolerated at best. I don't bring anything to the table socially speaking. And those feelings I've just locked away, which perhaps ironically have given me a knack for dry humour with deadpan delivery. Pushing away my emotions and keeping my face bland is something that's now second nature to me.

But now, now that i'm in my 30ies and have discovered my transness and have a handful of people I can call friends, there is apparently still that black festering place in my heart that I can't look at. My description of events really doesn't do justice all the reasons I became that way, but I hope it can be fixed by my transition. Whenever I read about people saying they become more sociable after transition I secretly hope that will happen for me too. But I'm also afraid, afraid that the psychiatrist will say i'm not trans, but that i'm just broken in my head.

I don't think that last thing is likely, it's just a fear. But I am wondering if this is somehow more common or if i'm really that unique.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"The truth is, and I'm bragging without shame, society at large accepts my transition because I'm just so cute, and they're fully aware of how bad I look as a guy. I'm only 5' 7"" and quite small boned and feminine-faced, so society gives me a pass to pursue feminine stuff that makes me better-looking. I never experience transphobia.

Except from my damn parents.

Older women call me cute names like ""love"" and ""sweetie"" and ""darling"", while my own mother calls me ""gross"" and ""ugly"". Then wonders why I'm so mean to her.

Girls always say they are jealous of my eyelashes and they are perfect for mascara, but I put on makeup and my parents heavily criticize me and make me feel ashamed and tell me to get help (code word for conversion therapy).

Girls always say I have the perfect square-shaped nails for nail polish, but if I tried putting on nail polish to school, my parents would probably disown me.

Older women call me ""pretty"" and ""cute"" but my parents still keep insisting that ""you were a very handsome boy and you ruined it""

Older women always smile at me when they see me, even if they don't know me, because I'm just that cute. In comparison to STRANGERS WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN ME BEFORE, it feels like my own mother doesn't love me.

"My journey to realizing I am trans and accepting it has felt like a long one. The thought of being transgender first occurred to me six years ago and I am now 25. Within the last year I have seriously considered the idea and it has slowly become more real for me. The past six months have been the hardest though. Within the past six months I have realized that yes, I am transgender, and yes I need to do something about it because I am not happy with where things are. Four months ago, I officially admitted to myself that I was transgender. I admitted to myself that it wasn't just a phase, that I couldn't deny the feelings anymore, and that this was my reality. it all felt like a huge slap in the face that I did not want. I was frustrated at the situation and mad that I was transgender. I did not want to be transgender. All that being said: I have made huge strides to help me feel more comfortable with myself and who I am as a person. Back in the beginning of July I changed my name to a shortened masculine form of my birth name. Changing my name at work was a huge step for me. Changing my name was one of the first affirming steps I took that made me realize I was trans. In November, I told my parents about my new name change. At the end of July I started going by they/them pronouns which didn't really feel right but they felt better than she/her pronouns. Three weeks ago, I told all my close friends that I wanted to go by he/him/his pronouns. Three days ago, I came out at my job as wanting to use male pronouns and I also came out to my parents at the same time about the pronouns. For the first three days after asking to be referred to with male pronouns I felt great. I had this huge euphoric feeling like i was floating on a cloud. I also felt an immense amount of relief and a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders. I felt happy. In the months leading up to the pronoun change I felt very depressed and anxious and dysphoric. After changing my pronouns it all became real for me and I felt like transitioning was possible and that it was what i needed to do. I felt very confident in who i was and what i wanted. Everything seemed to fit into place and I finally felt more like myself. However, now three days after all these amazing feelings, I feel the dysphoria again and the confidence has subsided. I feel like People don't see me as male. I pass as male based on my looks about 50% of the time but my voice is super high and as soon as i start talking everyone knows i am female. I just really wish I had a deeper voice. Why do I feel worse after coming out and after feeling so good about everything? Is it normal to feel worse after coming out? ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"*Long story* 
I had a talk with my dr. today during my physical and I got the nerve to bring up that I didn't quite tell the nurse all the meds I was taking. I started with DIY a few months ago (ill-advised I know) and wanted to get a blood test as I never got that initially and she asked about why and why these specific things (I had them written down). 

I showed her the hrt meds I was taking and she asked ""What is your end goal?"" and there must have been something about the way I mumbled or the look I had because she quickly said she understood what they were for. 
I had thought I was tough/prepared/etc but I didn't even have the nerve to say it out loud. I am generally extremely quiet and introverted so it comes as no shock that I am afraid of the reaction(s) saying I want to transition brings. 

She was really nice about everything but had no experience in this area and couldn't refer me to anybody and said I would have to research it for myself. 

**ACTUAL QUESTION:**

I know there is a pdf link around here. Is that up to date (I mean the doctors/locations)? Do I just start ringing up the offices and start asking if they are taking new patients? 

Anything else I need to do? I have very little experience with doctors/hospitals so assume I will not know even the basics.
I am in central WI (pretty popular city if you know football) if that helps any.

Thank you. 
Sorry about the huge text. I have only a handful of friends (who don't know) and I don't make new ones easily so this just rattles in my head all day with no outlet.

"I've developed these tips for coming out to people. It's a combination of what I got taught by my psychiatrist, the things I wished I'd changed when I came out, and my own experience working with trans people. 

I've repeated this a few times in various threads now, so I thought I'd post it so I can link easily.

###Why come out?

Basically, it makes your life easier. Hiding is stressful, it's not fun. If you're living some kind of double life it is going to grind you down over time. 

You're not obligated to come out to anyone, however if you don't disclose to someone close to you who's life is going to be affected to some degree then you're far more likely to leave them with a sense of betrayal and secret keeping if you don't tell them before they notice or find out indirectly.

Often times people avoid coming out due to fear of a bad reaction. This is the worst reason to avoid it. If you leave it longer then the chance of a bad reaction increases because of that sense of betrayal.

When relationships break down due to infidelity, it's not generally the infidelity itself that's the problem, it's the lies and loss of trust. If say your wife finds out you're trans and transitioning when she stumbles across your alternate FB profile with photos of you out with others, she's going to feel incredibly betrayed. This is what destroys relationships. Sure she might have left anyhow if you'd disclosed early, but you improve your chances by doing so.
No you're not obligated to out yourself to people, but if you want them to have a chance at trusting you, you have to give them the chance.

###When *not* to come out?

If you're financially or otherwise dependent on someone like your parents, and they're going to react badly to the point where you're on the streets, then play it safe and keep it to yourself. This isn't going to be fun, but you need to be safe first.

If you're in this situation you're probably best not coming out to anybody, or at the very most someone you really absolutely trust or has no connection to your current life (like a support group or something). With every person you tell, the chance of it getting back to the parents increases rapidly. Consider seeing a psychologist or someone duty bound not to disclose.

###Who to come out to?

Your SO or spouse should be first on the list. Parents and siblings should be on the list too if you have a relationship with them. Close friends you'd probably want to tell. Once you've got all that done, then just post it on facebook or whatever. 

###What is the aim of these tips?

The aim of my tips is to get you through a difficult process with your dignity intact and feeling stronger. You can't control how people are going to react, you can only control your own actions. 

##The tips:

1. You're sharing information. You're not asking for permission. This is how it is, it's not something you need approval for. You don't need to apologise for being trans, you haven't done anything wrong. You don't need to ask permission to have heart disease, you don't ask permission to be trans. Don't expect to get permission from someone who's not going to give it. Unless you're really lucky, your SO or spouse won't want you to transition because being in a queer relationship isn't something they want, and that's OK. It may be something they accept as necessary for your on going health, and they may well adapt to the change in circumstance, and be gracious if they do. Conversely, you can and probably should express ""sorry for how this will affect you"", because that's only fair. Maybe your Mother's church group with look down on her, it's fine to express that you're sorry about that because well, that sucks for your mum.

2. There's no perfect way to come out that will grant you acceptance. In the end if someone has an issue with the information it doesn't matter how pretty the language. You're better off being direct rather than indirect with the message - use simple words and terms and don't be overly long.

3. It's scary to come out, but it's just something you have got to do and not avoid. Finding out indirectly is the worst way. If the person you're telling finds out from someone else, they're more likely to have a bad reaction. The more you avoid it, the harder it gets. Conversely, the more times you do it the easier it gets, and can even start being fun/amusing.

4. You're not responsible for other people's bad reactions. If you had a cancer diagnosis and that got people upset, it's hardly your fault. It is what it is. ""How could you do this to me?"" ""I can understand this takes some getting used to and you might find adjusting difficult. Being transgender is just something that happens sometimes, and it's happened to me."" You could throw in an analogy to cancer or depression if you wanted to, although that might not go down so well depending on the person.

5. If you want to explain how you got to this point, but don't go on the ""science defensive"". Sometimes people google up a whole load of stuff, and then try and argue with you. You're better off not engaging in argument. If someone has a fixed opinion, arguing with facts opposite to that opinion actually just hardens their stance. ""I read somewhere that this is a sexual fetish and most people regret it"". ""This is something I've come to after longstanding and deep introspection. I feel hurt that you think I've not explored other options or that you know me better than I do. I can sympathise that this might be hard to understand for you, but this is who I am"".  If you can get the discussion to feelings, then acknowledge their feelings and express your own this is better. You can't deny someone else's feelings exist, and they can't deny yours exist either.

6. If someone still doesn't get it after step 5 you're better off just disengaging. Continuing to JADE - Justify, Argue, Explain and Defend, just results in circular arguments and a load of wasted emotional energy. ""I'm sorry you can't accept this, I hope in time you will come around. I need to go now"" and leave or change the subject.

7. With those close to you they may go through the famous stages of grief - denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. The stages of grief are pretty common in all life changes, not just loss of a loved one. Don't be surprised if their reaction and comfort level changes and evolves over time as they get used to it.

8. Some people accept straight away. Some people accept it in time. Some people will disappear from your life. It's just how it goes, try not to take it too personally. You can't control other people's actions, just like they can't control yours. There's always some loss, and there's some gains, but in the end transitioning is better than jumping off a bridge, so there is that.

9. If you tell someone, don't expect them to keep it secret. It's a bit unfair - you're putting a big thing onto them and then you expect them not to talk to anyone about it. If you do ask to keep it a secret don't be surprised or resent it if they tell others, it's just how it goes. You're better off asking them to tell you who they're going to talk to about it, ask them to keep it to themselves for a limited time (weeks at the very most), or just rip off the band-aid and post it on facebook or whatever.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Hi,

So I've been coming to terms with being trans for a while and have been opening up to more and more people about it. There's now about ten or so people who know and a few who sort of know but it's not confirmed/discussed. Family stuff.

"So i met a girl some time ago, we had a lot of fun and shared many interests. She fell deeply in love with me and quickly attached herself when i started being nice to her. I am a very stable person and want to fix most problems, so that stuff didn't bother me much.

We started chatting a lot and soon i started getting feelings as well. And dreaming about doing stuff, you know the whole thing when you fall in love. She had a lot of mental problems, was suicidal and on medication / therapy. So i wanted to help as much as i could. She started going down the spiral of negativity and kept telling me how she would hurt me and i should leave her and that i was too good for her. I really tried so hard to get her mood back up. For a moment i stopped being worried because she started sounding relaxed again. Then she started going back down that dark spiral, and told me her story and told me that she would stop talking with me after sharing this.

She felt like she was a girl trapped in a mans body, and was molested as a child. So she had a problem of the thought of other touching her body. She told me that i was the best thing that ever has happened in her life, and i was the first person ever she wanted to let touch her and embrace her. We even sexted days before this and i made her indulge(sorry this is awkward for me) for the first time in a long time. She told me she was pre-op and is going to do an operation next year.
I couldn't believe it. My mind was telling me that this person was a girl, and i wanted to kiss and hug her so much. So it was so out of reality for me that i told her that i didn't believe her, and that she said it to try and push me away because she kept saying i deserved so much better.

We talked a little more, i was starting to get confused and just a little bit disgusted in myself. I hated it and couldn't believe it. I told her to prove it, with a picture of her now. She told me that she was going to cut communications once she had showed me because she didn't want to see.

With this she wrote:  
""say you want to hug me and kiss me one last time..""  
""tell me again what could've been""  
""i need this to be our last memories together..""  
I told her i really did want to hug her so much and kiss her. Even in a mans body no matter at this moment.

She sent the picture and i started to cry, not because i was sad that i felt no attraction to the man. But because i really wish that i could love based purely on the person i knew inside that man.

I really wanted to be her anchor. Even after this i still do. I still wanted to make her laugh and smile since she never does. I want to protect that person so much, she deserves so much goodness for all the shit that has happened in her life. She has cut contact with me now. I know i will be fine i have gotten over heartbreak before... But it hurts so much right now because i still want to help. But i have no way saying that anymore.
And even if i fucking did i would end up hurting her so much more later on. Fuck. I'm so afraid that she will commit suicide before she gets the chance to experience her transformation, and i can't do anything. Please someone who has gone through the other side will she make it? I can't have her die. God i never cry but i can't hold them back, there is nothing i can do to help her. Please someone help me understand this.

**Edit Thanks a bunch people. I am starting to calm down a little bit, it still hurts a bit. I appreciate you guys being so friendly and understanding towards me. I learned a lot about your world and the hardships you go through. I can't begin to imagine what it must feel like. But thank you for sharing what it's like being on the other end.

"I've found more than a few threads on swimming as a trans woman here already, but I have questions about swimwear that aren't addressed by any of them because I'm not looking for beachwear. I want something I can train in.

Last year, I returned to athletics after a five year dry spell. After years wasted feeling anxious about being seen sweaty and without makeup, I went for my first run outside on November 4th. I used to worry about the bulk added by building muscle (in hindsight, a really stupid thing to let get to me) but my priorities have strained and shifted.

Running's easy, albeit expensive. Swimming is another beast. I haven't swam in a pool since I was thirteen and it makes me really, really sad to think about it. I just signed up for a two week free YMCA membership, but I can't get what I want out of it because I don't know how to prepare myself; for the locker room, for the fit of a swimsuit (non-op but post-orchi), etc.

Maybe, like running, I just need to do it to start feeling any better. But, hearing others' experiences or advice might also help.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"I got a dress in my room that I somehow ended up with, and a suit (shirt, blazer, trousers and tie). 


I tried the dress on first. Dresses feel amazing, but I look in the mirror and I just see a guy in a dress, it makes me feel quite upset. 



What I see in a mirror never quite looks right. I know it's me, but it just feels odd, like something is not quite right and I have no idea what. 


Anyway, I then tried on a suit, and looked in the mirror. I felt so angry (a dysphoric angry) and I just hated what I saw. I struggled to even look at the mirror comfortably. 



All I want is to be reborn as a girl and end this maleness. If I were born a ciswoman I'd never have any of these problems. 


I look into the future. I see myself as a happy transwoman or a depressed man. 




I don't now what to do. I'm not sure if I'll be able to get HRT or not in 2017, but hopefully I will. I might go back to being a cis 17 year old soon, although I've been like this since October and it's only getting worse, not better.

"I told my mum I had gender dysphoria (the symptom, not the diagnosis) in August, nothing else. 

She spoke to her brother about it sometime in the last 4 months. He asked his son about it around 4 weeks ago. His son responded in the affirmative (but apparently disclosed no information while failing to understand that he was creating new information by telling his parent something they didn't know), when he should have said ""I don't know what you're talking about dad"". 

My cousin told me what he'd done (without knowing it was a breach of my privacy), but I had not read my messages on facebook for almost a month so only found out today. :(

Since apparently my uncle has phrased the question under ""sex change"", my foolish cousin has given information to his parents which I never gave him.

Now I have to find a way to stop my uncle talking to my mother if it's not to late. If it is too late, whatever information has been passed back to my mum is likely fiction. Afaik my cousin only said yes without elaboration.

/endrant

Lesson: If someone asks you about a third person, and they apparently have information from someone close to that third person, do not assume said third person has 'come out' to whomever their source was.

EDIT:

Explained myself to my cousin, he said ""I won't tell anyone anything you've told me, but if someone asks me if you're transgender I'm not going to lie for you"".



EDIT2:

&gt;This failed to convince him:

&gt;Simply the reason this is so distressing is that I donâ€™t know what you said yes to, to your parents. And if they relayed it to my mum, it could be a COMPLETE FICTION.


&gt;The last thing I need to get from my parents is a question about something about me which I know nothing about which they think is accurate. Most people do not know the up to date or correct terminology for specialist subjects like this, crossed wires can be very very easily made. For example the term â€œsex changeâ€ means to me only ONE thing: Removal of the penis. 

&gt;I have zero plans to have my penis removed. Currently all I want removed is hair on my torso and shoulders. 

&gt;Likely that is what my parents will think sex change means. The current colloquialism is â€œtransitionâ€ and that can be social/physical/mental/surgical/medical/hormonal/legal, and social can be as little as just changing pronouns, as legal can be name and gender markets. 

&gt;In effect, from my perspective you told your parents I want to have my penis removed. Thatâ€™s very bad since it is 99% untrue â€“ and the 1% accounts for my research of the subject matter. You must see how that is not something I want relayed to my parents. Donâ€™t get me wrong, if gender affirming/confirming surgery is a treatment which might have a positive effect, I canâ€™t rule it out as part of a course of treatment. But now, and a no point in the last 10 years have I wanted that. I wanted that when I was 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21. But that was back when I didnâ€™t understand the difference between gender, biological sex and orientation.


&gt;GRS/GCS is one of the most painful and radical elective surgeries out there, yes for binary male to female transwomen it is consider necessary and lifesaving (and not elective). But I donâ€™t, nor have I ever, correctly identified as a transwoman. Again, I wont rule it out (I am hopeful that my teenage desires were correct). My gender and understanding of my sexual orientation has changed distinctly 9 times since September 2015.


&gt;I have mentally transitioned, I canâ€™t go back, I never thought of myself as male, but not in those terms, historically it was just a â€œwrongnessâ€, a dysphoria of my gender. But thatâ€™s it. That is a mental realisation. 

&gt;If I decide that I donâ€™t wish to move further with any other aspect of â€˜transitionâ€™ Iâ€™m sure you can appreciate that I do not need the hassle of â€˜unâ€™-coming out.

"There is a girl in our class who was born a boy but being a girl. She makes fun of herself all the time for being trans. She came out last year, and started going as female in september.


Like, for example, we where playing kahoot (its like a quiz game, and you can put your own nickname on it) and she put her nickname as ""Gender Bender"" (I think it is a reference to futurama). 


Another time she said ""I sexually identify as an attack helicopter"" and stuff like that. Also, we had a think about lgbt acceptance at school, and she just says ""well thats fucking gay"" or something similar.


She has always been a bit on the overweight side and is fine with fat jokes too. 


I will admit, she has always been a bit of an attention seeker, even as a boy, but is this just her pretending that she doesn't care.

"Since it's the new year, I've been looking over the events of 2016 over the last few days. This year's been an interesting one for me personally, as I have finally managed to put a label on how I've been feeling all these years - I cannot live the rest of my life as a man.

It's been kind of hard working out what gender dysphoria is and if I have it as different resources say different things, and it's been very confusing and a bit distressing, as if nobody knows what's real and anything goes if you have anecdotal evidence. I once thought that I was depressed because of my disconnection from my emotions and my serious lack of motivation to do anything despite experiencing crippling boredom and lack of willpower to do anything (and I mean anything: eating, sleeping, homework, things that I enjoy like playing my guitar or video games), and when I do have the motivation to do things, there's never enough time, and it really pisses me off. However the whole hatred of my born masculinity made me realise it's probably something more than depression.

The thing is, now that I'm confident enough to tell someone, I don't know who to tell, or how to tell them. Whenever I try and tell my mom, I always ease into the conversation with something like ""I've been feeling a bit down"" or ""I don't really see the point in life"", but she always dismisses it and tells me it's just hormones, which just reminds me of my lack of the right ones and my overwhelming desire to replace them. I'm currently 15 years old (I'll be 16 this year) and I live in the UK, so if I go to see a doctor about this, they're going to have to tell my mom, or I'm going to have to tell her first, which I'm really scared of doing - not because she's a bigot or anything, but just because I don't want to disappoint her, and I'm really bad at explaining things with words, so I'm worried that I might make things worse.

I also don't have a clue who my GP is, or how to make an appointment at the doctors, or which doctors' to go to (me and my mom have been homeless up until recently and have lived in various different places). I haven't seen my GP since I was about 8 or 9 years old iirc, so for all I know, my GP could have changed.

All I know is that I want to go on HRT asap before I take the easy way out.

"As of today it's been 2 and a half months that I've really had the thought of being trans. In them two months my dysphoria has gradually gotten worse and worse. I just turned 17, and I'm AMAB. 



A few months ago I was incredibly sociable, I used to go out with friends every day, my social anxiety was getting a lot better, I passed all my GCSEs, I thought my life was getting better. 


At the same time, I did wish I was a girl a little. Although, it didn't really bother me at all. I just thought ""meh"" about it. 


But then in October, I discovered this sub, I started reading lots of stuff about dysphoria, and then I thought ""wait, maybe I am transgender"". Ever since then I've had more and more dysphoric thoughts, sometimes I even think what's the point in living if I'll never be a cis girl. Other times when I'm not dysphoric I feel really annoyed for not caring about being a girl. 


I've become really depressed, my social anxiety has gotten really bad again, I skip sixth form because it makes me have less dysphoria which equals more denial, which I hate. Instead of going out with friends I just stay at home and I don't really eat that much anymore (I'm a bit overweight, I used to be able to eat tonnes of food and still be hungry). This has all happened in the space of 2 1/2 months.

"I will start this off by saying I am AMAB and in my late 20's. I am unhappy with my appearance in general because I am obese, so it makes it harder to really figure out wtf is going on. 



* When I see an attractive woman, often I wish I looked like or was her, and I get turned on. Some times it's hard to tell if I want to be her or be with her, you know?

* I don't think I've ever seen an attractive man and wished I looked like him. I am generally not attracted to men. Though the body of a really fit guy might get me goin' and penis. I like penis. But I've never been interested in being with any guys I've known.

* I have read stories and captions about MTF transformations and often wish I was the character involved. Reading these turns me on. 

* I have never had any desire to crossdress. 

* When watching porn, I fantasize what it would be like to be the woman. I often wish I was the woman.

* I don't think I am necessarily unhappy with being a man, but maybe it could be because of my weight? Like, the fat might hide more masculine features or something?

* I don't hate my penis and am not distressed by it. In fact I enjoy it because it makes me feel good. 

* I am not sure when my fantasies about being a girl started, but I do remember at least a few occasions when I would pretend to be my ""sister"" when talking to my online friends over instant messenger. I can't remember the nature of the conversations I had, and I don't know if I thought I was playing a prank on them or what? This happened over a decade and a half ago when I was much younger.

* I am not bothered by male pronouns or my very male name, but that could just be because I am used to them. I don't really think about it much.

* In video games, I generally play more female than male characters if given the option. I have played a lot of various characters male and female, but lately I have noticed I tend to play females much more often than males. 

* I might be depressed in general. I have never once had a suicidal thought though. 



I made it in a list because it's easier to organize my thoughts this way. I kind of just wrote stuff as it came to me. I don't know what to think specifically because most of the time fantasizing about being a woman either is a result of me being turned on, or results in me being turned on, so it's really confusing me.

At college (AKA high school in other countries) I'm not really that dysphoric at all. I sometimes don't understand how I'm so dysphoric at night.

But I don't really see the point in transitioning when I'm like this.

"TL;DR is the title.

I'm looking for information or a personal account of someone who has undertaken some form of permanent hair removal in the vaginal introitus after SRS.

For personal context:

I got vaginoplasty via the Thai non-inversion method almost two years ago. I was informed that hair removal on the perineum was optional so I did not pursue it. Because of that decision I now have a significant amount of hair in the vaginal introitus which is difficult to manage using traditional temporary hair removal methods.

I've searched Reddit but failed to find information about removing perineal hair after surgery.

Yes, I've asked the doctor, and will share information when I receive it.

So, I was feeling like it was a good time to do my workout, so, naturally, I got dressed.

I can talk more about why I am like this if you wanna hear.


Usually, I just get into my clothes, and do my work out for 20 min, then change back into those weirdly shaped suits to get to â€˜realâ€™ world things. But today, I decided to take my phone out. â€œIll just look at myself through the camera and not take any pictures to be safe.â€ I told myself. So I did for a while, and started off positioning the camera so I was a feminine silhouette, and did some poses. After that, I went out in the open, posed a bunch&amp; made the cammie hover around my body for a while, searching eagerly for the most feminine and confident angle&amp;pose, curious about how it looked. I usually hate selfies, and can only remember one other moment in my life I took one, and it was for a teacher I really liked. So it was a new experience, and I was still totally comfortable with it all. Wanna know what the cammie saw? Sure thing! Look below.


SO, little break... to talk about---My body! Skip this if you arenâ€™t interested. 


___BEGIN_____


Legs, Hips,&amp; Ass- 8/10-They have always been the strongest part of my body, and I can kick &amp;scissor hold with a fatal force that could beat several cis women (Iâ€™ve measured myself holding around 130 lbs. of pressure for 15 seconds straight), and run a mean 6:23 mile. My legs &amp; ass are super toned, and look really nice, maybe with the exception of my upper thigh, where the muscle contrasts slightly with the kneeâ€™s minimal fat(I am also extremely thin, which ill elaborate later why this is an issue in the rest of my body desc) when I flex or get in a certain position, and my ass, which is strong, thick, packed tight nâ€™ firm(, but the outer left and rightmost parts have a sizable hole from the serious lack of fat, visible when Iâ€™m naked/in underwear in an ugly way.


Waist/Back- 7/10-I have a nice curve, but ribcage is visible (even to the point you can oftentimes see my heart pounding fairly distinctly). However, all the fat in my body distributes to my core, which, is really visible in weird situations only, thankfully. Another issue is that my core is weak&amp;NOT TONED!!


Bust/Shoulder/Chest-Etc-3/10- probably the worst part, maybe tied with the face. The skin over here wraps over the masculine shoulder frame, biceps, and arm, and when I flex, I look like the Hulk, almost. This is probably the most annoying part about my body in a way, and ofc, ive not gone through HRT(im just a 16 y/o teen, going to do it much later but Iâ€™ll do what I can to make it easy for now)


Face-5/10-This really depends... If I wear a cap/hood to cover my face, I look pretty feminine if I can make slight adjustments to my expression. Otherwise, I have a square-ish shaped chin, and stocky brows, the usual brown guy look, and yes, I am brown.(however, my lashes make most cis folk jelly ;D).


Voice-2/10-I know this isnâ€™t part of my body, but I felt I should talk about it as well. Its basically 100% masculine, but when I try hard in girlmode, I can reduce that by up to â€œ40%â€.. But thatâ€™s very hard... Also, I tried singing once while moving my larynx (with my throat muscles, ive heard using your hand is bad), and I sung. Now normally, my voice is extremely squeaky, and I canâ€™t even sing a full octave, but that time, I could sing all the songs I knew, while shaky, astoundingly wonderful from before.
All in all, my body looks like a normal thin female/male frame depending what I wear, and how I wear it. Usually, exposing the legs w/ a hoodie makes me look feminine, and jeans&amp; a t-shirt make me strikingly masculine. Iâ€™m brown (bit lighter than most), so I grow hair in good amounts all around. But I love, in a way, the ability to literally shift gender... but of course, Iâ€™d rather stick with being a woman.


~Me&amp; my workout regimen!- SO, to explain my bod, I decided to tell you quickly what I did. I did this a few days a week for about 6 months, and the results are basically above-NOTE-I vary these and its really random which one I do each day. Sorry if I confuse you! :(


Ass-Huge focus here- I mean, like Ass,Ass,Ass,legs,Ass,Ass,flexibility, etc. 

Assisted squats-30X-I do these about once a week

Hardcore run-All out mile sprint, once a week.

Scissor practice-I take 2 pillows, lie on my side, hand on my hip, other resting my head, like a â€œsexy poseâ€, force myself to scissor the tip of my foot down and make contact with the other and hold it till I start shaking&amp;canâ€™t take the shooting pain any longer(usually about a minute). WOULDNâ€™T RECOMMEND. I made this one specifically for myself, also given that I had very strong legs before. If you wanna do it, be very careful. I wont accept responsibility if you hurt yourself doing this, or anything I mentioned in this entire post!!!


Splitz-I just keep going lower and lower and lower and lower... until my legs start crying.. cant wait for that one day when I go all the way down and my crotch fits down perfectly on the ground, no balls or anything, like it should! ;D

-NSFW-

Hi kicks-Kick higher, keep kicking,.. see how high I can put up my kicks, SHOW THEM ALL THAT FEMININE JUNK! LET IT FREE! LET YOUR HOT BODY ROAST THE MASSES! (sorry if this is rude, but I think of it like Iâ€™m showing the world my real â€˜junkâ€™ doing it in these shorts)


Clamshell-self explanatory-search it up


Pistol squats-Remember when I said I got legs of a femme fatale? Yep, the pistol squat is a one footed squat.. currently im working on the one where you bring your leg all around your body and hold it in front of you while squatting on a single foot. 


ELYPTICAl! :D-I love these so much, not because they make my ass and legs nice and tight, but its fun!, and I really enjoy it! Itâ€™s like you are skating across magical field where everything is controlled by your sheer will for a body thatâ€™s finally yours. You gotta relax and do the stuff you love!


________END_______


Now, I decided to pull out a swiveling 360 degree stool, and put the camera under it(Imagine it like I had you put your face under the stool facing up, so you could see the bottom of the stool and it's legs, my limbs, and my partial shape spinning from underneath the stool). I stared spinning, looking at the camera to see myself like this and making shapes and moving my limbs, dancing for the first time, like Iâ€™ve wanted to for years, but in a unique and quirky twist: Spinning around at the same time! I was overjoyed, and was making passionate kicks now, and stretching out my body in new shapes and positions, all while spinning around on the stool. And then I decided to take my second ever true selfie- I took a full out, 6 minute video-I spun around, swiveled, danced, posed, had a few awkward moments struggling with some hard positions(I was trying to spin while making a C shape, with my back on the stool and my body facing the ceiling, and fumbled, almost falling off the stool... then giggled and tried another position). I then spun rapidly, afterward pulling my hands from my side to show a heart towards the camera-telling my future self how much I LOVED THIS MOMENT, EVERY LAST DRIP AND DROP OF IT. I then took the camera from underneath, stuck it inside my bra, and spun some more, starting out from my point of view, and pointing the camera at my feet eventually, while wriggling and doing cute things with them while I spun. Finally, I took the camera, did a quick run-up of my body, and adjusted my bra &amp; ended the video.


Afterwards, when I changed back into idk what even, I decided to watch the video-I was scared. I thought it would be like every other video of mine, awkward and strange, with me doing something silly(not in the good way), while everyone just stared. Heh...  I started watching, and it was clear


Words.They canâ€™t describe the feeling. OMG! It was like.. my heart was pulsing, letting out a feeling of respect, fear, admiration, and total bewilderment to this radiant, confident, quirky, passionate young woman showing the world what she was all about, telling the viewer that â€œI donâ€™t care, what you think. I know Iâ€™m sexy. I know Iâ€™m confident, imaginative, fatally feminine, beautiful on the inside and out, loving woman whose going to change your life foreverâ€ vibe to it. I was SEXY. I was HOT. I was so.. FEMININE! I could almost feel the dysphoria burning and shriveling in my feminine blaze of confidence. I never knew I could do this. I only saw myself as the loser who never got anything she ever needed. I actually cried a little. Bringing this up now... it makes me water up. I couldnâ€™t believe it. I thought I looked like a jock wearing a bra and having a penis bulging out of panties all the time... But here I was, OWNING THE SHOW, showing off my true colors like the young woman I always knew I was- I didnâ€™t think I could have been much more feminine(maybe my giggles sounded masculine, but that was probably all). This changed me, even though it was just a matter of hours ago, for the rest of my life. 


And I want to thank you, thank you thank you thank you thank you, THANK YOU!!!!!!! For reading this all, for giving a shit. 


It means so much to me, and I promise I mean it, every single one of you. Itâ€™s SO fulfilling to know all the effort wasnâ€™t wasted. PM me if you wanna chat about ANYTHING! Please! I wanna chat with yâ€™all. All I can say is, this really changed me, as a trans, and also made me feel like all the effort that never paid off-finally did in the most feminine way possible!!!

"This has literally been driving me crazy for months now but whenever I look online to see the results of SRS I'm always put off... It doesn't seem good enough...? Am I just too picky?

It's not like I look at the results and dismiss them either... I found many of those 'natural vagina' images which is meant to show guys what average and 'real' vaginas look like and even then when I returned to the SRS images I kept pointing out anatomical flaws...

Am I being picky? Am I ungrateful for what is available and do I need to just deal with it?

On a side note I've also looked at FtM surgeries and even they don't seem to look the part... I really wish there was a way for me to 'donate' my equipment to somebody and vice-versa...

"Pre Hormones.  Pre coming out.  Pre everything.

Earlier today, my dad and I were working on my car because the Check Engine Light came on and we were trying to figure out what the issue was.  So we were looking at this thing and that thing until my dad asked, ""Why don't you get the car manual from your trunk?""

My entire body froze.  The trunk, that's where I had one of my dresses and one of my leggings were hidden.

He was still standing at the front of the car, at the engine, while I looked.  So I looked, and there was no car manuel.

My mom then pulled into the driveway and she began to talk to my dad.  I thought about making a break for it, to run upstairs and hide my clothes, but I didnt.

I went to the front of the car, where my dad now stood talking with my mom, and told him that the manuel wasn't there.

""Its got to be in there Alex.""  He then left my mom at the top of the driveway, walked to my trunk and said, ""Open it."" 

Then, me thinking of any excuse that my mind could grab, I said, ""I cant.  There is a present for you in there, and I don't want you to see it.""  

He rolled his eyes and walked back to my mother.  I was hoping that he would go back inside the house and wait for me to hide ""his present"".  But he didnt, he just stood there talking.

My brain was scrambling, looking for a way, any way, out of my situation.  It was then that I realized what I would have to do.  What I did, was I stuffed the clothes into my coat and ran.  I heard my dad shout ""Alex!""  as I flew into the house carrying my clothes.

I was worried that they would come in through the short cut in the garage and get me.  But thankfully they didn't, and I ran to my room and hid my clothes inside of a large typewriter case.

When I came downstairs, I saw my mom.  She asked me, ""Alex, what's wrong?""  And I told her that I was hiding my dad's present, that he almost saw it.

When I came back, my dad said he found the manual on the front seat, and we then continued our work.

This was honestly terrifying.  This is only the second time that I have been nearly discovered, and I hate it.  I hate having to live with this secret and worry about these kinds of things all the time

"My first doctors visit for HRT is scheduled for February 13th which is still a while away, and one of the things I wanted to ask about being prescribed is finasteride to help with my hair. I'm in my early 20's but my genes are cursed and I have some thinning at the top and my hairline is ""peaky"" (shaping like a V) I've been pretty desperate to get some growth back or at least prevent further loss, even now to the point where every other night I'll create a concoction from soybean oil, vitamin e, and saw palmetto, and apply it to my scalp. The reasoning being that saw palmetto supposedly is soluble in oil and that soybean oil and saw palmetto both can be absorbed subcutaneously and have slight (underlined) evidence that they can prevent testosterone from being converted into DHT which is the form of testosterone linked to Male pattern baldness. So far this mixture hasn't accelerated hair growth significantly but it has seemed to stop further hair loss. During weeks when I slack I notice sometimes I shed a few hairs in the shower vs weeks I'm diligently applying it I do not shed at all.

I forgot about it, but today I was peeing and looked on it and I thought that it's weird, 5 years and it didn't disappeared. I googled it and apparently... these lines mean that you have hormonal imbalance in your body, and it appears mostly in a pregnant women.

"Throwaway for safety.  I'm going to try to sum this up the best I can, so bear with me please.

I've been at my job since May of last year, and in November during a quarterly review with my boss and a rep from corporate I tell them that I would like to come out to the office.  I tell them, quite clearly, that I would also prefer to begin being referred to as my female name and to use correct pronouns.  They tell me a HR rep will get in touch with me so we can get everythings squared away and inform the office.  A few weeks later (around Thanksgiving) I talk to an HR rep who assures me she is going to get in touch with someone from my office to get things going.  She also tells me about an employee in another branch who came out as Trans.  

She assures me she'll get in touch with some folks and we'll be good to go.  About two weeks later, I receive an email from the HR rep with an article from a website about the Trans individual in the other branch.  He gushes about how cool and understanding everyone has been, and, how he even got his own private bathroom stall.  I was pretty upset at this point.  I work in a very mysoginistic environment.  

I was scared to come out to people on my own, and HR seemed to really be dragging thier feet on the issue.  Fed up I decided to start telling my co-workers, one by one, that I would like them to start calling me by the proper pronouns and name.  One coworker I come out too, congratulates me but makes me pretty uncomfortable when he tells me ""Your gonna look pretty sexy"".  At this point, nothing has been done by HR.  I'm still being misgendered and deadnamed, including people I've come out too.  The man who called me sexy even goes as far as saying ""I bet you look great in a thong"" WHILE continuing to misgender me during conversations.  

Around the beginning of December I stopped using the restrooms at work, in all honesty out of fear for my safety, and if necessary I just went across the street to the single occupancy restrooms at Starbucks. I also tell them about the bizarre sexual comments and other crappy comments.  I have a meeting with them where they tell me that the head of the office has been contacted and he will tell ALL of the managers in the office, who will then tell the employees that work under them to inform them about my situation and to start using proper pronouns and referring to me as my correct name.  I tell them I'm uncomfortable in a misogynistic and unstable environment with lots of volatile people that I'm not yet comfortable with how the office would respond so I would appreciate a neutral restroom until the office is fully aware and accepting.  Clearly, with all that's gone on I feel it's not only essential for my safety but I figure since they made such a big stink about giving a trans man a private stall surely they would give a trans woman a neutral restroom, right?

Anyway, about a week after (supposedly) all of the managers have been told, two of them (who were walking together) each have a brief conversation with me.  They BOTH call me sir and deadname me in the conversation.  These are managers who not only should of known for a week at this point, but should be backing me up and telling the people under them about my situation.

At this point, I'm not really sure what to do.  I don't feel safe using the bathroom.  I'm not sure if people are taking me seriously.  I've had numerous shitty sexualized things to me that I've told to management with no action.  I'm currently on vacation, but frankly I'm scared to go back.

I should add that I live in a major american city with local and state laws (if I'm not mistaken) laws protecting gender identity in employment.  Any advice is appreciated, especially from any lawyers that might be potentially willing to help.  Thank you!

"Hi,
I'm currently in the process of finding a female name for me but I kind of ran into a wall.
I really like the name ******, but a girl that I almost started a relationship with has this name and i'm probably going to see her in a few months due to a festival at my old school. It feels kind of like I'm ""stealing"" her name but I think the name is really beautiful and has a cute short form.

The other Name I consider is the one my parents would have given me if I would have been born a girl but I'm not quite sure about that one.

How have you decided on your name? The meaning of the name is kind of irellevant for me. I have already gone through a Top 1000 girl names list :/.

"This is probably something I should ask my therapist, but it's come up with my mother a few times. 

A few years back, my mother had a student at her Tae Kwon Do school who came out as transgender at the age of six. While I was very excited to hear this because yay! Someone is out and figured it out! My mom was more skeptical and cited that when she was six she wanted to be a boy. She said that she used to think being a boy was the best thing in the world and she wished she were a boy- but then she grew out of it.

Well, I distinctly remember having a similar period of time in my life. I remember asking my mother why I wasn't a girl at a very young age and receiving an answer to the effect of ""god wanted you to be a boy"" which I suppose was enough to shut me up because I don't remember it ever occurring again in my mind until I was about 10.

"Ever since I was 8, I had an odd feeling that I was different from the other kids. The vast majority of my friends were male, and I flat-out avoided the other girls because their hobbies and interests were boring. I didn't care about this at the time. I have a vague memory of myself wearing a boy's shirt and I recall looking at it and thinking this was the best day of my life, but unfortunately I never got the opportunity to pursue those feelings because I had no male siblings. I had a habit of sitting down with my legs spread out slightly, and my mom repeatedly told me to close them, though it felt uncomfortable to me. It
 
Later on when puberty came, I had breasts and I hated them with a passion. I began wearing large jackets in public in order to hide them, no matter the temperature. I then started looking at boys, but not really because of attraction, but because I badly wanted to look like them. Their hairstyles, their clothing styles, their flat chests- I refused to admit it to anyone, but I envied them badly. I despised looking in the mirror then, because all I saw was a girl trying to look like a boy and failing badly. I began to make fantasies about becoming male, and I scoured the Internet for said stories. Nearing the end of middle school, it became worse. Whenever I looked at an attractive man, I would get a strange happy feeling from imagining what it would feel like if I looked like them. I began crossdressing after watching a girl on a video do it successfully, but I soon stopped because when I looked in the mirror all I saw was a girl trying to look like a boy. 

I didn't have a name for these feelings, so I simply tried to ignore them. One day, I made the mistake of telling my mom it, and she brushed it off and told me I should just be a policewoman. Later in an argument she let the word slip: Transgender. I looked it up and it just seemed to fit. As the year slipped on, the male side of me got stronger. I felt an aversion to female articles of clothing (they wrapped around my waist and I hated it). I also avoided mirrors. By that point, I thought of myself as male, and to look at the mirror and see otherwise was deeply disappointing.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Hey. 
Just posting for some help. I'm an AFAB person who is nonbinary. I generally present as pretty masculine. 
I'm asking for help because I have a friend who is also nonbinary and who has massive struggles with people being really shit about it. 
My issue is that I want to understand more about their gender and the different ways of being nonbinary. They are also AFAB, and they are femme, and attracted to cis men. They don't really have any issues with being told they should act in a way which they don't want to, they act, dress, perform in every way as they are expected. Their major issues is around pronouns, which I respect, and I know they find it incredibly difficult being misgendered constantly. But I need some help understanding a gender and gender oppression which seems to be largely based on language? 

Its not that I think they're wrong, not nonbinary, less valid or anything at all. I just don't want to be part of the mass of people hurting them by not getting it. 

I get that my not getting it is likely largely to do with me, because I'm not fussed on pronouns. I get funny about titles and that but mostly people  just call me by my name, and I'm used to she. But when I've been not respected because of who I am it never been because of langauge. It's being spat on because of how I look, or hit because of being with my girlfriend, or being told to walk differently etc. I know my friend has a much harder time than me and is constantly furious or suicidal because of misgendering, so I need to get why and how language is such a big thing.

"Hey everyone!

So, as the tiltle says, some aspects of my dysphoria seem to be getting worse since I realized I was trans.

For instance, I never liked having body hair, but I could just ignore it and power through it and wear swim shorts to go to the pool/beach, and normal shorts on hot days, though more recently I only ecer wore pants except for pool/beach.

However, I realized I was trans this year, and I finally understood what I felt was dysphoria. It's really hot where I live right now (southern hemisphere, it's summer) and I just had a family meeting/dinner/party  for new year, and the thought of just taking my shirt off to use the pool and showing what little body hair I still have after shaving just feels terrible. Showing my body, honestly, feels bad, and it always has, though I could usually just do it, but now it's way too uncomfortable.

The main issue stopping me from getting started has been depression/anxiety making me constantly put off making an appointment to actually go and do something about it.

Is it a bad idea to start self-medicating now to maybe give me a bit of a kick into actually doing something about it and making an appointment? Even if I were to go see my GP tomorrow my understanding is between waiting for specialist appointments and stuff it would take upwards of 3 months to start officially, which is a lot longer than I think I can wait.

My main concern is that it could make it hard to move onto official treatment if my levels are changed to begin with from self-medicating or that I might get into some sort of trouble in trying to start if I have been self-medicating previously.

About 6 months ago I finally came out to my wife and other family members about how I feel.  What's going on inside my head and what I would like. Most people were calm about it except my wife of course and who is to blame her,  no one.  It was hurtful the things she said and how I would never see my kids again and all that jazz. In the end it all calmed down because I was given that ultimadum of losing my family for good or just living life the way people want me to be. 
Months went by and it brewed in me harder than before and on top of that our marriage was never the same even though we just brushed it under the rug.

"I'm not a dad yet, in fact I'm still pretty young. Although I cannot even promise my future kids this, I just think you people deserve these.

If you feel girly:

- I want to take you out for family picnic, and make you flower crowns.

- I want you to shop for beautiful, beautiful dresses, even the Disney dresses (not oftenly, because this is not the most interesting thing for me, and possibilly the other dad)

- I want you to be able to say ""But my dad tells me I'm beautiful!""

- I will gently french braid your hair.

- I will let you be comfortable saying no when things you are asked to do makes you feel uncomfortable. Too many women these days are taught that they are obliged to sacrifice themselves for others.

- I will not exclude you when I am teaching my other kids mechanics or basketball, but if you are not interested, you are free to go

If you feel guyly:

- I will not physically harm you just because you are physically tougher. When you get into your first fight, I'll ask you why you used violence, and challenge you that from today on, you need to find a better solution than violence; and teach you that true power is being able to use force, but choosing not to use it in situations not appropriate.

- I'll try to attend as many matches that you are in as I could.

- I will try to explain to you how something works when you take things apart to see how they work, and set appropriate limits about what you can touch, and what you cannot. (Instead of shouting at you beforehand)

- I'll take you out to your first Barber shop.

- I will share with you an expensive whiskey, before alcohol is just a party-mood-booster to you

- Despite feminists wanting equality, and they may not want to have their chairs pulled out for them anymore; I will teach you what it takes to be a gentleman, by being one myself.

- There'll be a PlayStation at home, or something else for video games they have in the future. I'll let you show me a few cool tricks that I don't know.

- I'll share with trans sons how to take care of yourselves when your boy part is ""under maintenance"" [Wear ""pad-holders"" (These https://goo.gl/images/WB6fxt ) beneath your underwear so you don't stain your pants; walk around often; cut caffeine; drink hot green tea; have panadol if your boy is starting to act up]

Everyone:

- I want to annoy all of you when you guys are on your first dates, and tell you guys that if that person plays with your heart, emotions or trust, I'll make them pay for it; and if you do that, I'll make you pay for it.

- I want you guys to feel so comfortable with your sexuality, you can just tell me right away ""Dad, I think I like this guy/girl/person, he/she/they is SO cool.""

- I want you guys to not have to fight for right pronouns, I'll supportively help you make an announcement during family dinners after you come out, and if any of our family members do not support you, I'll host another family dinner during festivals, which only allow non-transphobics to come. In the public, when someone mispronounce you, I'll find a way to call you ""son"" or ""girl"" on purpose, so they feel less foreign to call you the right pronounce you deserve.

- I'll make you love music by enjoying it myself. I'll play music instruments, and teach you how to play them if you ask me how, and sometimes dance with you, because dancing and music makes you feel good.

- I will read to you guys. Children books. Poems. Then when you get older I'll lend you guys my favorite books.

- I won't ridicule you when you make a terrible performance in front of the family. We can just causally laugh about the tiny mistakes you make TOGETHER, and let you do it again until you do it right, then celebrate with you!

- I will teach you that education (among other things) is not ""an end in itself"", but ""a means to an end"".

- I'll raise you to be a reasonably empathetic person, and that you don't have to be stone cold just to protect yourself from emotional abuses or emotional neglect.

- I'll make you all camp on your own in the wild for 4 days by the time you turn 18, it'd be a family tradition.

- I will take us out to volunteer as a family.

- I'll buy you a Burberry trench coat when you have your first ""stable job"", and you'll have to buy one for me in return when you have your first paycheck.

- When you face a trouble, I'll let you know that if you fail to find a solution on your own, I'll be there for you to take part in helping you sort your problems out. The least thing you need would be self-blame.

- I'll make sure that you are loved. No matter how you are born.

- The society is crude, I cannot protect you from all that. I am just an ordinary man. All I could do is to provide a shelter for you, when what happens outside our door is too much, and take care of you, until you are able to stand on your feet again to go to wherever you are going.

I am not a perfect dad, even if I have done all that, but I just wanna let you guys have this. I wish I could be there for you guys when you had your childhood.

I have been there, and it doesn't have to work that way.

"This is my first ever major post on Reddit. But I feel it's time to start talking openly to people even if it is just the internet.
Im a 26 mtf pre T and just coming out. This Friday I am seeing a psychologist and going to go through that.
So my hardships are similar to probably most of you all. I told my mother of how I'm feeling internally and how I don't feel comfortable with myself for the past 20 so years of my life.
My mother who I thought really was supportive must have been going through some problems because she told my father who now thinks of me as being highly mentally ill and would rather see me fight these feelings and to stay as what I am. My plan was to eventually tell him when I had my courage high enough.
Like how the fuck can someone just tell you that you're fucked up when you already know what you're going through isn't their norm? After hearing him say all this I felt like my world started to collapse and I was just numb. I came to them for support mainly just emotional. I have my own job as a programmer and privately discussed this with my boss and a coworker. Thankfully they are quite supportive of me in what ever I chose. Or at least so they say.
I just feel very lost and hurt inside because I thought that people who were the closest to me would at least try to understand but it seems I was too hopeful and should have seen this coming. How did you ladies or men deal with this? How do you try to help them understand? Are they experiencing the stages of loss?  I thought I was following steps right but I think I stumbled and fell. The pain hurts. It hurts a lot ...
So with or without them.. I have to see this for myself. If the world puts me as an outcast then so be it. At least I will finally love who I am both physically, emotionally mentally. Hopefully things with this psychologist will go ok, I've only ever been to one once before for an unrelated thing (losing a friend).

"I want to preface this by saying that I am not a licensed therapist or psychiatrist. I'm also assuming that this is a very rare scenario, but I wanted to share it with anyone who is currently questioning because it really opened my eyes and cleared things up for me a lot.

I also would like to say that I am in no way trying to discredit people who actually experience gender dysphoria. Following this experience, I feel I've developed a deep sense of sympathy (maybe even empathy) for transgender people.

Anyway, following puberty I had gotten into transgender fiction. It was a sexual thing for me at the time, and I never really and truly considered becoming a female (except in fantasy, if that makes any sense). It was more the concept of being forced into becoming a female that got me off. 

Fast forward 5 years or so... My girlfriend at the time shows me the movie ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" and I absolutely loved it. It really resonated with me, so much so that a few days later I was suddenly struck with this overwhelming feeling that I might be transgender. Little things I used to do as a kid that I once wrote of nonsense suddenly presented to me a glaring signs that I wanted to be female (growing my hair out when I was 10, wearing my moms shoes, etc...). It hit me like a ton of bricks, and for about a month it was all I could think about.  

I felt utterly disconnected with the world and the people around me. It wasn't so much that I felt out of place in my body; I just had a strong desire to experience life from a female perspective. I felt as though if I could not be female, I could never be happy. It got so bad that I started seeing a therapist.

After about a year, my therapist and I came to the conclusion that I was not actually transgender, at least not in the sense that I really wanted to be female. What was actually bothering me was my inability to express my true self. In other words, I was happy with my body, but I was not happy with how I was being forced to present it. 

This didn't really make sense to me at first, but I tried my best to follow her advice. I tried wearing girl's underwear, letting my girlfriend put makeup on me, and I started performing in a RHPS shadowcast. All of this helped, then one night (I was no longer with my girlfriend at this point) I hooked up with a girl I had met at university. I don't want to go into any details, but she took total control of the situation. 

The next day, just as suddenly as my feelings of uncertainty came on, they evaporated. I loved my body and and I felt totally comfortable in my own skin. After about a week, I came to the conclusion that I was very submissive in the bedroom. I believe I had been confusing my desire to be dominated with a desire to be female.

5 more years later, and nothing has changed. I still feel very comfortable in my body, and I have totally embraced my nature. 

I guess my point is that there's a difference between enjoying things and behaviors that society views as ""girly,"" and actually wanting to be female. At least for me there was. 

At the end of the day, you are who you are, and the society you live in is nothing but a (very persistent) construct. As soon as I accepted that, and stopped giving a damn about how I was ""supposed"" to dress or act, I realized a much better understanding of myself. 

I hope this post might clear things up for people who may be experiencing similar feelings. If your situation sounds at all similar to mine, my advice to you would be to find a therapist that you get on well with and do some serious soul searching. You never know what you may find.

"Someone in my family was telling me less then an hour ago that they watched this programme last night about transgender people. There was one person who was an expert on transgender people and he said things like, being transgender isn't a mental illness (which I completely agree with in every way!!), but he also apparently said that some people can think they are transgender even when they aren't. Now, this scared me because I am not sure if I am transgender or not.

Then there was his opponent who was talking about regret, she even had people on her side saying that they do regret transitioning (one said that they wished that psychologists had looked deeper into his case and found out what was really wrong with him, because he said he is not forced to live as a man, when he just wants to go back to being his assigned gender, which is female) and she even said that there was apparently no proof that there is a difference between the male and female brain (even though there is a TON of scientific and psychological proof to say otherwise that there is a difference and that transgender men have cisgender men's brains and that transgender women and cisgender women's brains!).

As a questioning transgender woman, this raised alot of questions and really just intensified my doubt. As I was being told what was said I was thinking things like, ""what if I am just thinking I'm a transgender woman because of traumatic events in my life"", ""what if I do regret transitioning into a woman"", ""what if I am just transitioning into a woman because of the cultural advantages"", ""what if I'm just mentally ill"", ""I don't really feel dysphoric over being a male, so maybe this is just a fetish"", ""maybe I am just attracted to the female gender role and not actually being woman, as I have been told this before"", ""what if I just want male attention from men and there why I'm doing this?

"**Please read it all before replying**

So I have two friends that are very likely experiencing gender dysphoria (both MAAB), but both insist that they have no desire to transition. One cross-dresses sometimes and seems to really enjoy it. When I asked him if he ever thought about transitioning, he admitted to questioning for over a decade but says he is happy as a man. The other said that he would have transitioned if he knew it were possible 13 years ago but that he has no desire to transition now. He also insists he is comfortable living as a man. 

So the question is are they repressed or is what they are saying actually possible? I showered them with links and resources on being transgender and transitioning, but they do not seem interested in learning more.

I wonder sometimes if the reason they talk to me is because they are flirting with the idea of transitioning, but that makes me worry that seeing me fail at transition is discouraging them from even trying. I will have been on HRT for two years soon and am still miserable, so I worry they see me and ask themselves what the point is. 

I have also been doubting myself thinking that, if I were not mentally ill, I might be able to tolerate living as a man and not feel like I need to transition. I am very depressed. In contrast, they seem pretty happy and mentally healthy.

Please help me understand.

I have a past that involves dressing secretly (but not consistently), wanting to be the boy that the girls decide to put make-up on, etc

However, I feel that a lot of what I want from it is shallow. Things like wanting long hair that I can dye and style, being able to experiment with all of the different make-up, not being limited in what kind of clothing I can wear, etc. Just all these ways to express myself that I feel restricted in by being male. But I'm turning 26 soon (I know it's never too late to transition) and feel that a lot of those things described above happen more in youth, and I worry that by the time I'd pass, I wouldn't get to fulfill those roles for myself. I feel shallow in my wants because I'm drawn to the outward aspects and social constructs of being a woman, but don't know that I'd feel right identifying as a woman the rest of my life. 

If anyone could help shed some light on my feelings or share some of their own experiences, it would be much appreciated. From what I've seen on this sub the past 2 weeks, you're all quite wonderful people so I'm really sorry if anything I said offends anyone, I'm still trying to learn more about the trans world as I go.

"So I gave myself an IM injection in the thigh earlier, and....really scared I accidentally injected into a vein.

I pushed the needle in slowly (because I'm still getting past needle fears), injected, and....after I finished injecting, while the needle was still in my thigh, I saw a single little bubble of blood float up into the syringe.

Should I be worried? Is this a sign that I injected into a vein or something? I've never had a blood bubble float up *while the syringe was still sitting in my thigh* before and it's kind of freaking me out a lot.

I didn't get the burning oh-god-i'm-going-to-die feeling Google says injecting into a vein feels like, just dry heaving and coughing a little (and that might have been from nerves idk) and shakiness, but I'd still really appreciate it if somebody could tell me if i should be worried or not. :s",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I'm looking for a little bit of advice.

I'm an FtM living in the UK and getting treatment for my dysphoria on the NHS. I was hoping to get started on hormones soon, but after speaking to the clinician today, she said it's basically an all-or-nothing thing: I can commit completely to it for the rest of my life or not have it at all.

Originally, I wanted to only take it for a little while to get some of the effects of T, primarily the lowering of my voice.

Things like getting hairy, spotty and smelly really don't appeal to me. I guess I'm a little vain like that. I don't want to have to deal with all the maintenance that comes with all that stuff. The males in my family are predisposed to male-pattern baldness too, and that's something I really don't want.

Other effects though, such as increased musculature and genital growth are positives for me. 

I feel incredibly confused and stuck in this situation. I can honestly say that I don't think I NEED hormones to be happy, and as it stands me being pre-everything, I pass 99% of the time anyway. But I might be denied surgeries which I really know that I do want if I don't take hormones.

I just kind of get the feeling that nothing is going to move forward unless I play the NHS's game and follow their definition of what transitioning means.

Trying to rationalise things in my head, yeah, hair can be laser treated and spots can be tamed. I'm pretty sure the vast majority of guys go bald, so I should stop complaining and just accept it.
A lot of good things can happen from taking hormones: my periods will stop, I'll be able to build muscle far faster than what I've managed in the past four months, my hips should look slimmer thanks to the fat redistribution. Heck, I might even get a nice luscious beard out of it.

I figure if I was that unsure about hormones, then I wouldn't have been so upset when the clinician said I should wait a few more months and have a couple of therapy sessions. Then again that could've also been down to the fact that I'd discovered I couldn't take hormones the way I'd imagined and just the general feeling of pressure from wanting to make a decision.

Anyone else felt like this?
Has anyone here had experience of NHS treatment?

Thanks for your time guys.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"I go through phases. That's the one thing I keep going back to when I imagine telling my dad. Sure he has a live and let live attitude as of late (not so much when growing up). But that change is expected after some personal stuff we've been through.

Anyways.... I go through phases. When I was young I thought I was gay and came out. Got a bad reception from my parents and went back to girls. Though now, 10 years later, I identify as bi. I go through hobbies. I spent a couple years as a Mormon and loved just about every minute of it and believed it was a part of me.

Given things like this, I can't help but think it's a phase. Heck, my dysphoria and thoughts of being trans come in phases. Maybe I'm fooling myself I say because of this.

And to realizations...

I ended up spending a couple days snowed in at work. On the dangerous track back home all I could think was ""I want to dress up, I want to be Gabi tonight."" I didn't realize this or feel this until the ride home, but part of me felt relieved to be heading home to be alone and not have to fake anything.

Didn't even need to dress up when I got home, so it's weird that I feel better. Maybe I'm just a home body.

So as you can see, I have realizations (that make me think oh, crap!) but then go back to it's just a phase or I'm faking and there's got to be a better answer, like depression or anxiety or loneliness.

"I'm 4 months into HRT, I wear an apron and usually a jacket at work (its always cold), if I have the jacket off then the apron hugs my body in a nice way to show off what little boob I have. 

* I had the jacket on when I male failed.
* I came out last Tuesday and have a Sara nametag and everyone calls me Sara now at work. 
* I wear no makeup at work because I still feel silly wearing makeup and it makes me more shy.
* I shaved last night and my facial hair has been absolutely destroyed by HRT alone anyway (I'd say a 50% overall reduction with the 50% that hasn't dissapeared being lighter and softer)
* I usually use my female voice at work but today I was having a **very** bad day and was floating back towards my natural voice which has naturally gotten a little softer and higher (still sounds kind of male)
* My hair has highlights

So anyways after all those details you probably didn't need: The customer I was helping was waiting for her drink I was making and she made small-talk with me and then we chatted a bit more and she said ""Have a good day ma'am."" and I just stood there dumb-founded and slightly blushing with my mind completely blank. She must've thought I didn't hear her because she looked at my name tag and said ""Have a good day Sara."" and I sputtered out a ""Thank you, you too."" to her.

"Hello there, so quick bit of context for the story.
 - Openly Transgender (MtF)
 - Not on HRT (NHS sucks so hard)
 - Have bad anxiety
 - Have a slender not really guyish frame
 - Not great at writing so sorry for the typos and grammar

So I went to college for my course and my college has a bloody strict policy of gender and overall equality for student in the good way, people who are offensive/disrespectful get kicked out. On the day I was wearing;
 - An awesome new coat I got which weirdly makes it look like I have boobs (Magic wonder coat of dreams)
 - Women's skinny jeans because HOLY COW the are more comfortable that the male equivalent some how.
 - Pink and black butterfly scarf because it's pwetty :3
 - Black slouch beanie hat
 - Red plaid shirt 
So overall a rather feminine look in personal opinion. Anyway back to the story.

The room my course is in is at the very end of the corridor so I stared to walk to it and right before the room was a group of ""Men"", stereotypical douchebags (Jocky but ech people). As I walked through them they when silent and after finding out I was early I stood against the wall and waited. Then all I could see out the corner of my eye is 8 guys trying to sneakily stare at me with all the subtlety of a 3 year old and I just sighed, shook my head and said out loud while laughing ""Fucking hell"". A minute passed and then they had to find an ice breaker of "" Politics right?"" Followed by the most awkward forced laughs to start talking again.

It has been so funny watching peoples reactions to seeing me in women's clothes and I hope in some small way this could help someone to realise that really if your comfortable who the fuck cares.

"When I was very young, I used to dream of being a girl - nothing particularly painful or sad at that point, but I used to take my mother's clothing and wear it occasionally, that kind of thing. I hit puberty, and suddenly I have all of these feelings of sadness and loneliness, and my anxiety shoots through the roof. I worked out that I was trans within a few months, and that I desperately needed to transition or I was going to go crazy. I was about 14-15.

I tried to tell my parents several times, but every time I did they just responded with arguments why I shouldn't. My mother once told me that I could get a girlfriend 'if only I would stop telling everyone that I wanted to be a girl'. She expressed sadness over the fact that I already found it hard to find a partner, and at the same time that my dating pool would be vastly diminished because I'm trans. I already felt terrifyingly lonely, and being told repeatedly that I wasn't good enough because I'm trans was awful.

When I told my father, all he seemed to be worried about was that we wouldn't be able to do things together any more. That people would hate me because of sexism and transmisogyny. He told me that I was selfish for hiding my sadness when I was away from home at uni, and he told me to be careful of what I told my mother, because she worried about me.

I got stuck at a single sex school, so transitioning there felt like a terrible idea. When I came out to my best friend, all he could do was shrug and tell me 'good luck with that' and never mentioned it again. There was a culture of calling each other 'gay' and making jokes about transfolk, so I suppressed myself there too.

When the time came to choose my new name, I felt hamstrung because my given name was in remembrance of a family member. I didn't know how to feminise it, and I didn't have the courage to take a different name because I knew it meant so much. Additionally, my partner at the time expressed sadness and anxiety at having to remember a new name - so instead of taking the name I'd wanted and dreamed of having for such a long time, I took a feminisation of my given name in that regard as well. I felt so little ability to stand up for myself for fear of ending up truly alone.  

What about me? What about my mental health? Why do I have to tiptoe around everyone else's perceptions of me before they'll even try to understand and support me? I'm exhausted and I just want a hug. I'm so tired.

To try and maintain control, I've insisted that if they really need to tell their friends that I want to be the one to tell them. I'm worried though that I'm going to be pressured to do this before I'm ready.

"I desire more control over myself and I want to eliminate testosterone and estrogen to gain that. I want to become asexual, and lose emotions like anger and desire. 

I also want to become a leader, which may or may not be compatible with castration. I imagine that a person with less emotion and more control over themselves would be a better leader, am I right? I'm not aiming to be charismatic, but zen-calm, stable as rock. Impossible to buy, impossible to scare.

I may not be able to imagine what it's like to not have these hormones, since I have a chronic excess. I may become a victim of ""The grass is always greener"".

Is it how I imagine it? That I would be calmer, with less desire, but have more self-control and be able to function better? But there is another thing, since one is less daring afterward, is there also more fear and anxiety? Or less? And how about my assertiveness?

I guess the only sensible question to ask is, do you feel better after castration?",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I know no one here can diagnose me or tell me straight that I am - that's up to me to figure out, and I'm sure I will in time. It's just that I don't have anyone to talk to about this. If I could, I would talk to a therapist, but since I'm still a teenager, I'd have to speak to my parents about it first, and I'm honestly terrified to do that. I'd just like to hear an honest opinion from someone with experience in order to put my mind at rest.

I'm AFAB, but I haven't always felt comfortable presenting as a girl. Sure, as a little kid I wore dresses and skirts and liked pink and stuff, but something still felt wrong. I didn't really ""get"" the girls, and preferred to play with the boys. I remember sitting awake one night and wondering if something was wrong, if I was a boy raised as a girl to connect better with my sisters. That doesn't really make sense, but it's what I believed for a while, and I played along with it.
I used to try peeing standing up (and mastered it!) and made all my toys boys, as well most characters I made up for games and stories. I always played the boy in pretend games and video games. Once I accidentally bought a boy's shirt and the sense of excitement I felt was unreal when I realised. I remember once really wanting a pair of boy's pants, and while my parents said I could have them, we tried them on and they fit wrong and I was devastated.

When I realised my theory was impossible, I shoved these thoughts deep, deep inside myself, and tried to live normally as a girl (aside from getting my hair cut off). I knew what being trans was growing up, but for some reason I thought only trans women existed. I was thirteen when I met trans boys over the internet, and it all started again. That was almost three years ago now.
It's worse this time, though. I hate looking at my chest - I even avoid showering a lot of the time. I dress in mostly men's clothes and wear hats to cover up my hair (which is short but not as short as I want it to be). I don't really see a future for myself as an adult woman, but I still have doubts.
Almost all of my friends are LBGT+, and because all (except one) see me as a cis straight girl, I wonder if I'm making up all these feelings and memories so I can fit in with them. I spend a lot of time reading about trans issues, and I'm scared that I'm just easily influenced and that I just think I'm trans.

And even if I am, coming out terrifies me. My mother is accepting, but might think I'm too young to know yet. My father isn't intolerant, but isn't exactly understanding or accepting, either. What if I cause a rift between them? And my sisters a understanding, too, but I'm anxious about making things weird between us. We're pretty close, and I don't want to upset them. One of my friends came out as ftm trans recently, and he's kind of petty, and I'm scared he'll think I'm just copying him.

Is there a chance that I'm just pretending or have just been led along? I'm sorry for posting this here when it's such a long-winded and stupid question, but I don't know where else to go.",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"So my 18 year old brother just told me he was trans. We were talking about trans people and he just said that he's sure he is trans. He told me about how he looks at women and just imagines what it must be like to look like that. He told me about his dysphoria and how he sees himself as a woman in the future. He also told me he is still into girls, and not attracted to guys in any way. This is all so confusing to me, I know that gender and sexuality are two totally separate things, but it just makes it so much more difficult to understand the way he is feeling. It was a total shock, considering there are absolutely no feminine aspects about his life. He plays football, every single one of his friends are male, he plays PS4 with his pals all the time, he's a typical 18 year old lad. I will obviously support him through everything, and support him when he tells our parents. I have no doubt they'll be accepting, but I think they will be even more shocked than me. Its been about a week since he told me and I still have no idea what to say to him or what to even think about. I honestly keep thinking its a dream until he mentions something about it again. 

I guess i'm just looking for people who have went through the same stuff, or could help me better understand the way he is feeling. 

(edit - Sorry if I have offended anyone with my use of male pronouns here. I dont want to go round calling him female pronouns when he's asked me not to tell anyone. When i am with him im trying to be as gender neutral as possible and avoiding using any, I think that is the best thing I can do until I talk to him about it )

"If you hadn't heard, Texas' version of an anti-trans bill was just filed by Senator Lois Kolkhorst. 


SB6 makes bathroom/changing area etc. admittance incumbent upon what it says on someone's birth certificate. It also leaves a bunch of exceptions for custodians and maintenance people and people in there with a kid or people giving or receiving assistance or... basically it's pretty blatantly just targeting us while leaving plenty of good cover stories for ""predators"".


I'd like to know if any of y'all have the scoop on movements or organizations preparing to the fight the bill or what your own plans are. Stay and fight? Move away? Hide?

"Hi, I'm Bobby, 31y.
I live in Sweden. I will get free medication soon, free surgery when I lose weight and so forth and because of this I have such a hard time helping and connecting with other transpeople outside of Scandinavia.
I've had to wait for 6 years(it's supposed to take 1) to get my freaking testo which I'll hopefully get this month now as I've got an appointment and I feel really bad for complaining about it when so many can't even afford talking to professionals. I'm poor and I can't help my peers financially but I'd like to know what else other than moral support I can do for trans-individuals whom live without the privileges I have.
Thank you for your input. :)",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"Like I have lost all interest in sex, I don't feel the need for a partner anymore or even doing stuff to myself.

"Hey everyone I'm 25 and transgender (mtf) form Waterbury CT, USA. I'm finally comming to terms with being trans after denying it for so long. I'm just seeking friendship with trans friendly people or people going through the same thing as my current friends probably won't be accepting. I just want friends I can trust. That is all.",gender_dysphoria_disorder
"I can't remember if I've posted about this before but, like a few others here, I was raised in a fairly conservative Christian family; something that was responsible for a fair bit of denial before I realized yes, this was who God made me to be and I should transition.
Unlike many I've talked to, though, when I changed my views on gay/trans/etc. people (mostly due to, y'know, realizing I was those things...) I tried to hold on to most of the other religious/political things I was taught simply because they still made much more sense to me than the alternative.

Now, this might sound silly, but I sometimes feel like this prevents me from ""connecting"" with the Trans community at large as much as I'd like. I'm not here to debate anything; if you think what you think you pry have a good reason even if I don't like it, but the fact is that just due to the kind of nature of transition/where our society is regarding it, most of the people who decide to transition/be active or open in the LGBT community tend to be ""coming from"" a worldview somewhat different than what I come from.

For the most part, this isn't a huge issue. We all have the same struggle at large, share experiences, want the same kind of freedom/recognition/affirmation etc. and it's great to have people where we all ""get"" what each other are going through.
But, I just sometimes feel like that's all we have in common. We can always be friends &amp; support each other, but when it comes time to really ""stand"" for something, I tend to feel... distant? So many of the queer/trans friends I have care really passionately about things I kinda disagree with or just don't feel that strongly about and I'm sure they would disagree with or be confused by an equal number of the things I care about. Again, it's not like we can't be friends but I just tend to feel like this middling person who has to choose whether I want to share one side of myself or the other, never really having anyone I can fully be ""me"" around. Even most of the LGBT-affirming churches I know of tend to not quite ""click"" with me.
And it's not like I'm the only rightish-leaning or Christian trans person out there. I know this. It just feels sometimes like there are probably very few people out there who I could really stand with and not feel like the odd person out.
I just would really like to know, has anyone else felt like this? Am I being too arrogant/picky about my relationships? Again, I do have some great friends in my life. I just wish our diverging ideals didn't make me feel like that friendship came with a cutoff point is all.

EDIT: I attempted to be vague simply to avoid debate, but I see that kinda got turned around on me. Just to clarify, I consider myself more Libertarian as far as American parties go than ""far-right""/Republican/whatever. I still don't support Trump, HB2, etc. I just also tend to favor personal/religious freedom, free markets, etc. stuff that really doesn't directly relate to transition, but seems to have certain common positions among LGBT  people. As for religion, I realize maybe Reddit was not the best place to bring that up... ;P",gender_dysphoria_disorder

Does anyone else have sources they would be able/willing to share? Medically, resources from PubMed would be amazing! I'm in the process of sorting through studies listed there, but when I search transgender I get thousands of hits - it's going to take time to go through it all. Along with gathering information to have handy for presenting to people I know, I'm kind of hoping we can get a solid list of sources together for all of us to have access to that we can use to educate others.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

I say most of the time I feel like a girl and then ask myself ""Do I really, though?"" as an impulsive thought.. Surely, if I wasn't trans I wouldn't even be needing to have this anxious inner-monologue with myself. Maybe I'm just subconsciously tryign to find a way to cling to the past out of fear of change.. 

But I want to change, I want my life to get better. I don't want to be back at square one, feeling depressed and out of place. I look at times I've felt relaxed as a male and told myself ""Oh, see?"" but then I remember in most of those cases it was drink that had relaxed me.

"I'm like 4 months into transition, and it's really going well for me.  Feel desirable in dating, like it hasn't impacted work life yet (i'm not out there yet), and accepting family and friends so far..

But I still get so frustrated.  I feel like i'm too proud and have too much internalized transphobia.  I hear about other trans women, who are friends of mine, who get photographed without their permission, get stared at, etc.  And I just feel, ""I won't let that happen.""  But I know it's not necessarily a choice.  I feel too fucking proud and like i'm a really exceptional person (and starting transitioning has actually made me feel much more that way) SO I won't STAND to get gawked at!  Or discriminated against!

Now, I think i'm cute, although not at all passing.  I'm comfortable not presenting overtly femme, so stares and harassment haven't really been a problem for me.  Right now, i'm pretty comfortable being really part time, and just ~telling people~ my gender, and not being worried if service people and acquaintances and people in professional contexts gender me male.

So my issues, while not urgent or earth-shattering, are threefold:

1) I am petrified to start having noticeable breasts while still being read as a guy like, right as summer starts and I'll be looking for new jobs.

2) I feel like a jerk-- and possibly worried-- about how i'm sometimes tempted to compare myself to other trans women.  Like, ""well i'll look better than that"" or i'll be more cis-passing or more conservative about going full-time early on or more comfortable presenting androgynously rather than signaling full femme.

I feel like a jerk because this feels like internalized trans misogyny, or at least like caving to social trans misogyny.  And I feel worried because ~what if i'm never satisfied with my looks~?

3) last issue is that I really need to resume therapy.  Sorry y'all.  I'm realizing I need a professional to talk to about these things that are basically minor but that I nonetheless need to resolve.  Been trying to get back to seeing someone.

"Hello there,
I have been through 3 sessions of laser hair removal and i'm pretty happy with the results, even if there is a lot of improvement to do (on my chin particularly)

I saw this morning that the my skin was whiter on zones where I gone through laser. Above my lips, around my ears.. It this is something you can relate too ? I don't know if it's because I didn't protect myself enough of the sun, or it is because of the shadow made by the remaining hair.

In the beginning of the sessions I didn't put any sunscreen on my skin some days, because I forgot it at home and I wasn't able to buy some. FYI I'm in a sunny city (south of France)

If this is actually the reason of the color change, what can I do to reduce it ? Am I intended to hide it with make-up or are they more permanent solutions ?

"Not a question, but yesterday I went to Walmart to buy some disposable razors for shaving. I had coupons for both Gillette ProGlide and Gillette Venus. I was with my mom and I was too nervous to grab the Venus ones. But I eventually just went for it, telling her I wanted to know if they'd feel different than the ones I normal buy.

So, I get to the register and it's completely empty. My mother steps over near where the greeter would be (not knowing I wanted her close to me). Anyway, the cashier scans the super pink razors, no questions asked, doesn't even care. I hand her the coupon, but it won't work. Then a woman comes up behind me. I'm thinking ""really? just as I'm having coupon problems?"", but the cashier tells her it might be a while and the lady walks away. 

At this point I'm relieved, but the coupon still won't work. I offer to just pay the full price, but I don't think she heard me (or was just determined to get the coupon to work). So she calls over a manager. After about 10-15 seconds a man walks over, asks what the problem is, fully inspects the coupon, and just tells her to take the dollar amount off of the purchase. She said she was going to do it, but was not sure if it was ok. Anyway, he too didn't care that I was buying women's razors. He didn't give me any weird looks or ask if I was sure that this was what I wanted to buy. She takes the amount off, I pay for them, and leave. That's it.

It's more like ""I should just try it and see"" or ""I can't do this, I can't live the rest of my life as a woman.  I'm just wanting to do this so that I can wear women's clothing and make up.""

I am going to get 10 mg estradiol cypionate once every two weeks. Anyhow, how is it any different? I am guessing the dose is smaller due to it having a longer half life?

Sorry for the stupid rant post but I'm just really stressed out because I live in California and changing your name here costs $430 (i.e. more than my $400 rent). I really can't afford it. Maybe if I save a little bit at a time I'll save it up after like *years* but I just feel so split between all sorts of financial obligations and it's so difficult to know what to do. I'm attending college and I barely qualify for any financial aid (just loans) because both of my parents make a disqualifying amount of money and so I know I won't qualify for a fee waiver. It's really annoying and it just makes everything awkward because I'm never sure what name to sign on things or what gender to mark and I'm always worried I'm going to get in trouble because I used Claire when I should have used ****** and half my school stuff uses my deadname and half uses my actual name and my ID and banks use my deadname and *it's killing me* and I hate it. 430$ seems unreachable to me right now.

"It's been a really rough and difficult week for me, and to top it off today is the inauguration of a bigot, but nonetheless I need to cut to the chase because I need advice.

I sought out informed consent on my own without my parents knowledge around 4 months back and started taking HRT on September 9th. I was so sick of waiting, just knowing that potential growth is ever-so time sensitive. However due to some bloodwork my parents had done recently I was forced to come out to them earlier than expected. I've been an absolute emotional mess since then and I hurt them- deep, I could tell that easily, and it's made me miserable because of it.

We've had long talks since then, and I have come to realize how grateful I really should be... Even though this is extremely rough on them, all they want is to make sure that this is the right choice. And if it is, then they will support me throughout this transition. Essentially, I'm starting therapy again and I hope it will not only help myself mentally, but also help my parents in being comfortable and confident in that this is what I want and need. They even have offered to search out, i guess, a 'more qualified' endocrinologist than the 'physician' I met through IC.

But here's the problem, we started to talk about relationships, family, attraction and the idea of having biological kids one day. It could have just been the hormones talking, but the fact that my parents entertained the idea of sperm banking and that they would pay the expenses I have since had massive waves of regret for not coming out to them prior. I fear that my impatience has sacrificed my fertility; and I broke down crying just thinking about this.

I have no idea if I am sterile, or if by stopping HRT for a month or two I could regain sperm production since I am 4 and a half months in. But yesterday I decided to stop taking spiro and to wane off of estradiol until my hormones are back in normal male ranges, except I've already noticed strong emotional depression since stopping. This is basically a giant game of russian roulette and I hate to put hormones on pause during a critical period of growth.

Does anyone have any personal experience or advice that could relate? emotionally, I want to go back on hormones as soon as possible and work further towards my goal, but the opportunity of having biological kids someday becomes more and more important the more I think about it. Cause I know, 10-15 years down the road when all my friends are having kids and becoming parents I'm going to feel regret and primarily left out. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, with all the experiences and joys in this world that I have already missed out on for being trans, I don't want to miss out on another.

"Hi, everyone! I'm a cis mom of a transgender son, and I've been lurking around here for the past few weeks. I have learned a tremendous amount, and learned that I have so much left to learn.

My son and I recently started a support group for transgender, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people in our area. We live in a small community in Iowa, so we won't have a big group - although we're located near some bigger areas, so we might have people travel to attend.

I've noticed a few posts from people either anxious about going to support group meetings or finding them unhelpful, and so I want to ask - what things can we do to make a support group be welcoming, engaging, and helpful? What kinds of things would lessen your anxiety about attending in the first place? What things should we do to keep people coming back? Any and all advice is most welcome.

"I am wondering about transitioning, but I don't even know if it's even worth it in the long run or not, nor can I be bothered to. 



This is how I feel:





I can continue to live as a man. It's easier, cheaper, No HRT, no reactions, no need to worry about new clothes, learning how to do makeup, less discrimination, etc. 






Transition to female. I'll have to spend loads for HRT, surgeries (if I want to), loads of new clothes, makeup, freezing sperm, voice training, you name it. 







I know it probably sounds a stupid reason not to transition, but it's true. Whereas being female will probably be better, I don't know that for sure. What if I go through HRT and have permanent changes then I regret it? Is it worth loosing my fertility for something that might of just been a phase? 





I know I need to see a therapist, but I can't for multiple reasons.

"Hi, I'm 17 and I've been questioning since October. 




Gender has been always something I've ways had in my head since I was 12. It started out with me wishing I could wear skirts/dresses, and I'd crossdress in private for that. That was that though. I was attracted to girls only. 



Although I've always noticed how different girls and guys are, especially clothing. But it was more of me noticing the difference more than most people. 



But 2016 was the year that everything changed for me. I realised I would of rather of been born a girl, but it didn't bother me that much. I lived as male for 15/16 years, and its not something I'd change. 


Them we had the school prom, and I had to wear a suit. I didn't question it, because I was a guy and that's what guys wear but while at the shop trying them on I imagined being a girl and trying on prom dresses, and thought that would be alright. But still, not something I was really bothered about. At this point in time I still had no idea what transgender meant. 




Then in October I discovered about gender dysphoria. I easily the null hypothesis and that was Dysphoria. That was Dysphoria related to me so much, it was almost creepy. 



Then I felt so happy I realised I was transgender. At first I was excited as being seen as a girl, but I care about how I see myself and what I wear rather than how others see me. 



But over the past few weeks I've had some doubts about the whole thing. I keep getting in this constant loop and it's impossible to get out of. It's goes like this:


Do I want to be seen as a girl? Don't know. Do I want to be seen as a guy? No. Do you want to be AFAB? Not sure. Do I want to be AMAB? Not really. 



I feel like I'd like to of been born a girl, but I'm unsure still. If I imagine myself as AFAB I see myself being FTM. But then if I see myself as AMAB I see myself being MTF. But I don't know what I want to live as. 




Initially I wanted to be more trans so I could transition with less doubts. Now I don't care if I'd be more cis male or more trans, because either one would cause less doubts. Being cis female is not possible though. 



I feel like maybe I'm pushing myself to be MTF when in reality I might be NB or a crossdresser. I constantly have this feeling that I need to get on HRT and force myself to become a woman, and it feels like every day I'm still running off testosterone more masculinisation I'm getting. I'm starting to grow chest hair and I can't stop it. 


Not sure what to do here. Because of my location, financial, and safety I can't speak to a therapist (unless it was over IM) but none seem to do that. 



Can anyone explain what's going on to me? I'll reply to any questions or anything. Thanks. ",gender_dysphoria_disorder

I just finally convinced myself to start HRT and won't use the passport for at least a year. 

As someone who is about to graduate college, I'm going to hit a lot of background checks. Will a female gendered passport come up and out me? 

Looking it logically it shouldn't, but given that I need a job to pay for my transition while I present as male, its kind of a huge deal to me.",gender_dysphoria_disorder

"Okay so..this is really the first time that I've tried reaching out to a transgender community per se, and this might be kind of a long/rambling post, so read at your risk lol.

I'm 22, born male, been married a little under a year, with a wife who really wants to have children, and have been a lifelong Jehovah's Witness. I also for as long as I can remember have had crushing gender dysphoria, which has led to a host of other mental illnesses (severe anxiety, depression, most recently type two bipolar disorder), several suicide attempts, and a stint in a mental hospital the week before my wedding.

I have been raised by parents who were extremely unaccepting and intolerant of all LGBTQ-related topics, to the point that they would often change the channel and go on a rant about how perverted or sick the world is when a gay person came on, so you can imagine how it went when I told them the feelings I was struggling with.y mother and father were also extremely emotionally abusive and my father was physically abusive at times.

To make matters worse, the religion I am a part of is very intolerant of LGBTQ people as well. While it does not condemn the PERSON, it does condemn the ACTIONS. Which makes matters extremely difficult for me as someone who is struggling with gender dysphoria because I feel like it's all about action... I have disfellowshipped (or disassociated) from the congregation before because I was acting on my feelings, and kicked out of my house (this all happened when I was 18) but I still worked my way back into the religion because I love it and I do believe in it and believe it is the right way of life. But I still continue to butt heads with the congregation again and again and probably will continue to.

The point of all this... is that I deal with an almost unrelenting amount of self hatred sometimes. I am a big guy, around 6 ft. I've probably put on around 40 pounds in the last 6 months due to depression putting me at around 300 pounds now. I cannot even stand to look at myself in the mirror and go out of my way to avoid them. Almost every action I do, from simple gestures to talking, to walking, to even things I used to love, like playing my favorite video games, infuriates me at myself. I think: oh I should be doing this better, or why would a girl be doing this? Or, you shouldn't be spending your time doing this, spend your time learning makeup, or making up for all the years you lost.

I have played with cross dressing on the side and still do occasionally. My wife supports that fully and encourages it because it has at times made me very happy! And I do love to do it! I have several girlfriends who also support that side of me and encourage me to do girly stuff with them and etc... but anymore, I just can't. I can't will myself to do it. I think, what's the use? I'm just some idiot in drag. I feel like a pervert when I do and I feel gross and disgusting and I get so angry I can hardly bear it. I'm just wondering. Has anyone had this similar experience?

I tried to tell this person, ""it's hard to know what pronouns to use when talking about things that happened when John was still living as the *sex he was assigned at birth*.""

What followed was a SJW-esque tirade from this person about how I was using the wrong words since people are ""always the sex they are assigned at birth"" because biological sex remains stable. They added that ""transsexual"" is a ""slur"" because all that ever changes is one's gender (and that ""transgender"" is the only term we should be using).

I would always say I would rather of been born a girl, but I didn't really care much about it until August time.


I've always known there is something not quite right about me. I got tested for autism and some learning difficulties when I was 4/5, and I continued to have occasional therapy until I was 11. But they didn't think anything was actually wrong with me. 



In august/september the thoughts of thinking something was wrong with me got worse and worse. Although I never quite know what was up.



I then discovered about being transgender. I never knew that gender dypsohira is what was up with me, but I'm thinking my whole life that it has been gender dypsohira, I just haven't been aware of it.


Since then (around september) I've gotten more depressed, I get so angry and just feel like smashing stuff up because I was born male and not female. If I ever go on instagram, facebook, watch a music video. with someone who is female on it, it triggers is so much. I sometimes think I won't be alive in a few years time if I do nothing about it.



But, one part of me says it's just a phase and it will be over soon. One side of me hopes it is a phase, so I don't have this dysphoria again, but one side of me hopes it isn't so I could transition. But what if I transition, then realize I am actually male? 


What if I do nothing about it, then in a few years time I realize I am transgender and I'll hate myself for ignoring it? Or what if I do transition, then just cringe and look back to the 17 year old me thinking I was just a stupid confused teen?


What if I come out as transgender to my friends and family, then few months down the line I have to tell them that I am not trans and I was going through a phase?

"When one finally comes out to oneself, is it normal for one to spend a *lot* of time unable to decide if one wants to transition? Even when one is certain about their gender identity, does one normally come up with excuses against transitioning?

I spend every minute of every day of my life contemplating transitioning. On some days, I decide against it, and on others I favour it. I met an acclaimed psychologist soon after my realisation as a transwoman [which has left me elated, terrified and confused since (a month ago)] and he told me that transitioning or not was totally up to me, and if I chose not to, it wouldn't make me any less of a woman. While I agree to him, for me, personally, my decision is never fixed. On some days, I know I won't transition, while, on others, I know I *have* to.

I want to transition. I don't want to transition. I want to transition. I don't. Yeah. No. Yeah. *Fuck*. Is this normal? I keep coming up with excuses not to transition. Then I feel dysphoric and decide there is no other way than getting on hormones. Does one normally come up with excuses? Do/did you? What are/were some of them, and how long did they continue before you finally decided to transition?

Edit: I mainly keep telling myself I won't be able to play soccer anymore as well as I do currently (given the loss of muscle weight, I will lose a lot of essential strength) but, on some days, the dysphoria is such that I know I *have* to transition. If you are into soccer [or an equally/more demanding sport (or if you simply have enough knowledge about such things)] please share your thoughts.",gender_dysphoria_disorder
