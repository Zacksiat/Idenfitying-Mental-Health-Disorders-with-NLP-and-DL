I got diagnosed with dissociation about 2 weeks ago but it started around may last year after I smoked some weed with buddies in the woods. It wasnâ€™t my first time but this time it just felt different and Iâ€™ve been feeling out of it and my brain has been foggy since that night. Is there a way ne smoking could have caused it? And is it safe to try smoking again?,General_disorder
"After I feel someone has mistreated me theres a snap in my mind and no matter how long I've known them, they immediately feel like a stranger. For example, I had a bad relationship with my father and one day he came into my room before he went to work (he was crying) and basically told me I was embarrassing and then kicked me out. There was immediately a switch in my brain and he felt like a complete stranger. I have nightmares about trying to escape him frequently. The most recent time this ""snap"" happened was about 3 or 4 days ago, this time with my brother. He has never respected my boundaries and I've always been slightly scared of him. We got into a fight the other day that I knew was going to happen and I didn't give him any reaction, he just kept yelling at me telling me I was a ""fucking prick"" and basically told me that he thinks I'm a shitty person in every way he could think of. I just let him cuss me out and then he slammed my door and left continuing to yell about how shitty I am. I didn't notice the snap yet but now it's clicking. I had a nightmare about him like 1 or 2 nights later very similar to the ones I had with my father. Now I want nothing more than to get as far away from him as possible. I'm obviously aware he's my brother but I no longer feel any emotional connection to him. I don't understand why this happens to me and I just want to know if anyone else experiences this.",General_disorder

"My(28F) mom (74F) has been diagnosed with Delusional Disorder last year. The psych dr never told her the diagnosis and confirmed to me after I asked and said the nurse read me his notes from my moms first appointment. 
I didnâ€™t ask if there was a reason to withhold the info, I just assumed with her paranoia she wouldnâ€™t believe him. 

Background: 
About a year and a half ago my mom started getting extra paranoid. Sheâ€™s always been that way, but way worse since my dad passed away. My mom thinks her family is keeping her away from the man she loves (a man she hasnâ€™t actually seen in 30 years). She thinks this guy has been sending her music on Spotify and that he placed people that look like him around her one day to â€œplay a joke on her.â€ 
I talked with my step aunt and she recently she got in contact with him and said heâ€™s happy with his life and has no want to contact my mom. (I havenâ€™t told her that). 
Anytime I try to reorient my mom, such as ask her why someone would do something to her or why someone would care, she says â€œwell, I donâ€™t know!â€ And gets very irritated I donâ€™t believe her. 

Other examples are when she thinks her brother hired people to hack her email. She thinks her boss is dating the man she loves and thatâ€™s only because the boss said a vague general comment to my mom. My mom is now retired, but she was at the point where she wanted to punch her boss with how mad she was at the things she thought she was doing. 
Every time I speak to my mom she mentions how something has disappeared, implying someone took it, or just another comment about her family  controlling her life. Even though they donâ€™t live in the same state and have no reason or want to control my mom, 

The dr tried 2 different antipsychotics, my mom voiced that one made her not sleep and the other made her drowsy and she was concerned of falling. She only took 1-2 doses of these meds. 

The dr discharged her bc she said she didnâ€™t think she needed to go and he said that was fine, unless she feels scared for her life and then to come back and see him. 

My therapist thinks maybe telling my mom she has this disorder will help her understand why she thinks the way she does? 
Also! If anyone has any groups or something to help me understand how to handle my moms disorder, thatâ€™d be awesome.",General_disorder

"I'm not self-diagnosing, just looking for some advice. 

Let me start from the beginning.   

I am a sophomore in high school

About a week ago, right before falling asleep, I noticed that I would get these random intrusive thoughts that were unrelated to anything I was thinking about or doing prior. Like a word or phrase would randomly pop into my head. I didn't hear them though, but they were uncontrollable.   

I had a difficult time going to sleep that night and just hoped that it would be gone by the morning. The next morning I woke up with this very distinct headache on the back, left side of my head I took some ibuprofen to  relieve the pain and it didn't help. I still have the same headache to this day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the past couple days, I've had trouble putting my thoughts into words, comprehending simple things, and paying attention. also my memory has been terrible lately. I almost feel like my IQ has decreased by 50%. I'm also still having those intrusive thoughts right before going to sleep. I have not had any hallucinations, delusions, or anything like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, I've also been derealizing lately---feeling like I'm not there. Let me just list my symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Trouble focusing

\-Headaches

\-intrusive thoughts

\-anxiety

\-Memory problems

\-trouble comprehending things

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, maybe I'm being dramatic. But I've been falling down rabbit holes and really freaking myself out. I'm hyper focusing on everything that I'm doing and afraid that I'm going to lose my mind. And this back of the head headache is driving me crazy.",General_disorder
"Iâ€™ve been on Zoloft the past 6 months, starting at 50mg and moving up to 100mg a few months ago. Since I started Iâ€™ve noticed that even when I have energy to move throughout my day, I donâ€™t feel fully there mentally. Iâ€™ll have conversations with people and realize that Iâ€™m sort of on autopilot. My anxiety is way down, but Iâ€™m working with my psychiatrist to taper off Zoloft and Iâ€™ll be moving to just Effexor soon; Iâ€™m down to 50mg now. Iâ€™m feeling the grogginess more than ever now that Iâ€™ve decreased my dosage 2 weeks ago, and Iâ€™m wondering if this will go away soon or if anyone had similar experiences. Likewise, did you experience grogginess on Effexor? Any input would be helpful.",General_disorder
"So I've been working on getting better. As part of that I've been taking my dog for walks, yesterday I added about an 1/8 or so mile to our walk. Experiencing significant anxiety increase.( The best I can figure is that due to the severity of my panic attacks in the past, my mind has a pavlovian response to physical exertion as it shares many similarities to a moderate and severe panic attack. So if you know of any cognitive techniques or meditations to work through this kind of cross connection in neural pathways I'd appreciate your sharing. That's not why I'm writing this ) after being uncomfortably anxious for about 4 hours I decided to try and sleep it off, sometimes this works. Took a nap, had a dream were I was just as anxious, did some dream stuff to stop being anxious. Didn't work, so my dream self took a nap to sleep it off, putting me back here maybe a little more anxious than when I went to sleepðŸ˜‹ I think my subconscious just told me to deal with it myself!",General_disorder

"Currently I am writing this in tears...man, so many things happened. I know I have a very weak mental health and that makes me cry so much more. I often type about my problems and I know nobody gives a fuck, or if somebody does then I will get this people so much about my problems that they will hate me. Anyway, so what is my problem. Since I was born I was so weak and everybody was giving me presents, and didnt care. But then, after I grew up, people started to say bad things about me like ""he cannot do something"". I knew that I can but all the times they said about it they touched my weakest points where I really couldnt some type of a thing. After that, I got myself into object sexuality ""the thing when you believe something(like a car) is alive and you make a relationship with it"". So, I did that. Wherever someone said bad about me, I was always like ""I have my car, I am really not bad, I care about her,  I am not bad"". That was like a whole thing that motivated me, that was saying I am not bad. But then, I understood everything was fake and fell in depression ""yes I really did, because of so much stress"". After 6 months, my depression was gone. But, there is no thing that can motivate me right now like that. So I got into myself, only in my thoughts I feel safe. I started to enjoy being alone. I just didnt want to be like ""You are too young"" ""You are too small"". Only in myself I found the truth that I am not like this. I hated these families where somebody banned something and said that you shouldnt touch it, controlled somebody. I found myself happy in PC""s, the thing that would motivate me. 
And then the accident happened. I got really nervous after that. So, my pc broke, not the one that is ""mine"" but the one that was gifted to me. I tried to fix it. And, my parents just got me. They said why do I need to grab a mouse. And I told them. And they got really angry and said like ""YOU SHOULDNT TOUCH IT"". After that, I remember all 13 years of pain and offend, like I am a fucking pussy who cant do something, like I am only a problem. When everybody was judging me. And right now it is also like this. Everybody just fucks about me, they just say about my problems always. Like I need to do something, I need to fix something, I am a lazy ass, I am a bad person, I am an egoist. YOU DONT KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I TRIED TO FIX MYSELF! TO FIX EVERYTHING, BUT YOU KEPT SAYING ABOUT MY PROBLEMS! LIKE I CANNOT FIX A FUCKING PC, LIKE I AM TOO SMALL! And so, I fought with my dad. Then I got really deep in myself. I never want to be with someone no more. I want to be alone. Forever. Just shut up please. All your problems about me. I just wanna skydive in my thoughts, they are safe and all. And the problem is. Whenever I am going with someone. Here is an example. Yesterday my teacher said we should all work in group and no exceptions because there is a big event coming. And I just dont wanna do this. I wanna be alone. I wanna fuck on everyone. I wanna be safe. I wanna be single forever, because everybody fucks about me, and they just harm me everytime, with my ""problems"". I know I am not ideal, but man, I WILL CHOOSE WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO DO, I AM NOT A LITTLE PUSSY! I AM TIRED WEARING A MASK OF ""I AM FINE"" WHEN YOU ASK ME ABOUT IT, I JUST WANNA HARM YOU SO YOU LL SCREAM LIKE DEVIL BEING PUNISHED MY DOOMSLAYER, I WANNA BE FUCKING ALONE, ALONE, ALONE, FOREVER!  YOU VE DID IT TO ME, THIS DEPRESSION, I WAS SUFFERING FOR FUCKING 6 MONTHS, AND I FEEL NO POINT RIGHT NOW WHY SHOULDNT I KILL YOU FOR THAT! ALL YOU DID IS CLOSED EVERYTHING FOR ME, SAID THAT YOU ARE BETTER, DID EVERYTHING THAT I SHOULD VE DID, AND THEN SAID THAT I AM HARM TO YOU! HOW CAN I SMILE AND BE HAPPY WHEN I AM MAD AND PUT ON A MASK, HOW CANNOT I PLAY DOOM AFTER BEING WITH THIS MARAUDERS TRYING TO GET ME OFF FROM SOMETHING, LIKE I CANNOT DO THIS? LIKE I AN IDIOT, IN MY THOUGHTS I'VE GOT BIGGER THEN YOU, I AM BETTER THAN YOU, I KNOW WHY YOU DO SO TO ME, AND YOU ARE GOING TO PAY FOR MY SUFFERINGS! LIKE I AM FINE WHEN I JUST CRY FOR 5 HOURS BECAUSE YOU OFFEND ME SO MUCH, FUCKING MAN, I AM AFRAID I WILL TURN INTO A JOKER IF YOU WILL OFFEND ME ALWAYS LIKE THAT!

"Iâ€™ve done some research myself, but I in no way trust myself to interpret online psychological evaluations that may or may not actually be accurate, nor in ANY way am I asking anyone here for a diagnosis. If you know of similar conditions that might relate to this I donâ€™t have an issue with you mentioning it, Iâ€™d like to do some of my own research prior to my appointment with a therapist.

Here goesâ€¦

Ever since I was a kid, I have suffered with this strange issue. For context, I was never a popular kid at school, nor was I a social butterfly in any of my own relationships.

When I am talking with others, I will suddenly feel extremely overwhelmed. I will hear them talking, but Iâ€™m not listening to what theyâ€™re saying. The words flow in my ears, but they have no meaning whatsoever. As I struggle to try to understand the person speaking to me, I start to have physical pain in my head, like my brain is explodingâ€”sometimes itâ€™s so crippling that I have to just walk away from the conversation and recover. I literally feel compelled to get away from the situation because my brain feels so overwhelmed by its inability to follow the conversation. In my adult life, it hinders my adult relationships, eg, my family, my friends, my coworkers and bosses at my job, etc, because I am often unable to stay focused without feeling a severe inability to focus.

Same thing happens to me with activitiesâ€”and itâ€™s not just activities I donâ€™t enjoy, I canâ€™t even do things I love or want to do because of this. For example, if Iâ€™m in a work meeting, I feel like â€œugh a work meeting, I can do this, I just have to get through itâ€ and I sit there and try my absolute hardest to listen to the meeting, but as Iâ€™m sitting there, I begin feeling extremely overwhelmed and unable to focus on the words being said. In another example, I tried to watch a YouTube video (about 20mins long) the other day, and I couldnâ€™t get through it even though I WANTED to watch it. I had to shut it off, I developed a severe migraine and only what I could describe as â€œmental anguishâ€ and couldnâ€™t focus on anything for an hour or so, and then I got back to life and never tried watching it again.

Iâ€™ve struggled with reading my entire life as well. I read words but I donâ€™t understand them. I have to read a page of a book 4-6 times over before I actually comprehend its meaning. I canâ€™t follow 3-sentence-long baking instructions on an instant cake box, my brain becomes so frustrated. Texting is easier for me than a phone call, but both are so difficult for me to follow, it takes me 10-15 straight minutes to structure a reply to a 3-sentence text message from a friend. I feel extremely inefficient, to put it lightly. 

I soldiered through school reading assignments and was able to get through using Cliffâ€™s Notes as backup and trying my absolute best to do wellâ€”I was an A/B student, so it wasnâ€™t horribly debilitating for me back then. In fact, I would say that now as an adult it has affected me more than ever in my entire life. Itâ€™s gotten to the point where I canâ€™t even listen to music while doing a task like cleaning or driving somewhere in my car because my brain feels mental anguish over trying to focus on both the lyrics and the task at hand. I canâ€™t do podcasts, eitherâ€”big surprise. I have gotten headaches in the car while riding along with others who like listening to musicâ€”and the headaches were so bad that I had to put my head down and close my eyes and beg my friends to turn off the music. It has made me cry before, because I feel so angry and frustrated that my brain wonâ€™t let me focus on basic things. 

Well, a lot of times, I end up hurting peopleâ€™s feelings. Iâ€™ll be in a 3+ people conversation, and suddenly I can no longer pay attention. Iâ€™m struggling to understand and stick with the conversation, but my brain literally cannot keep up. I begin to feel the head pain, and I just instinctively remove myself from the situation entirely by excusing myself and walking away for solaceâ€”and then people think Iâ€™m upset or that they said or did something wrong. Same with trying to watch moviesâ€”Iâ€™ll get 20 mins in, and I canâ€™t do it anymore, even when Iâ€™m watching by myself and not in a group setting.

I did it my entire childhood, tooâ€”I used to play games on the playground with the other kids, and the moment my brain became frustrated with the task I was doing, I immediately removed myself from the game or activity. It wasnâ€™t distraction, per seâ€”I didnâ€™t feel a sudden urge to do something else, only a sudden urge to immediately stop doing what I was doing at the time.

I do it all the time as an adultâ€”I feel a sudden urge to â€œescapeâ€ the situation thatâ€™s making my brain upset, even though I have nothing better to be doing, and sometimes the activity Iâ€™m trying to escape is something I WANT to be doing. Itâ€™s so upsetting, because I want to talk and relate with others, I want to watch movies, and I want to listen to musicâ€”but the physical and mental anguish I feel when I try to force myself is unbearable.

Is someone on this forum able to try to give me an idea of how to deal with this? I am planning on seeing a therapist very soon, but I would like to get opinions from anyone who might be familiar with or suffer with these symptoms themselves and suggest how I can help myself in the short-term prior to my appointment. Thank you!",General_disorder
I never experienced anything like this before. I get days where I feel ok and then I feel really anxious. Some nights I can't get to sleep. I hear voices and sounds when I'm  about asleep.

"(I would ask this on the bipolar subreddit but Iâ€™m not yet diagnosed and I donâ€™t want to look like Iâ€™m fishing for one)

I have days where I feel all the hypomanic/manic symptoms but the intensity of them usually last about a day and after it doesnâ€™t feel as intense.I donâ€™t know to track the â€œmaniaâ€ if I donâ€™t know how itâ€™s supposed to feel over time.

Do I lose the delusional thoughts and just keep the energetic feel over a couple of days? But then how do separate Bipolar energy and ADHD energy? Or is the energy I feel due to mania because most pros say that I am ADHD(primarily inattentive)? Any help would be appreciated",General_disorder
"This might come across as if I am dumb and donâ€™t understand other peoples way of dealing with things but these are feelings Iâ€™ve had for a long time and I need a safe place to share it. Iâ€™m actually so tired of seeing everyone think theyâ€™re mentally ill. 
Donâ€™t get me wrong Iâ€™m all for mental health awareness but thereâ€™s a difference between feeling depressed / anxious and actually having an illness that makes it IMPOSSIBLE to function. 
Like how can you â€œhave ADHDâ€ and still turn in every assignment on time? Whereâ€™s the ADHD? How can you â€œhave depressionâ€ and still get out of bed everyday? and text all your friends back? Whereâ€™s the depression? 

Medicine doesnâ€™t fix it, treatment doesnâ€™t fix it, â€œworking harderâ€ doesnâ€™t fix it.

"Rant ahead:

Iâ€™ve had this type of same problem in my past relationships. When I would have a breakdown one would normally expect your partner to be there for you to comfort you, correct? Because this is what my therapist at the time told me that our partners should take care of each other when we are in need of comfort. But my partner at the time would just watch me breakdown and not do anything not even be an inch close to me, he would just wait it out. Until he told me one time, which is probably the worst thing told to me is, â€œhe feels like a babysitter when Iâ€™m having a mental breakdownâ€. (I experience Derealization/Depersonalization) this was the reason I would breakdown maybe once or twice a month because I was having a massive episode. 
I had told this to my therapist and she said that was not right for him to do. Time passes by we end our relationship on good terms and he apologizes for doing that to me and realizes it wasnâ€™t right to do that to me.

Now the present: I am currently with a new partner and it somehow popped into our conversation but I had let him know about this type of situation with my ex. And he told me that was really bad and that he felt bad that happened to me and that he would never do such thing. This started happening more recently and he has started doing the exact same thing. I have a breakdown out of no where or a panic attack and he just keeps doing what he was previously doing. Iâ€™m crying in the middle of the room and he just ignores me. I donâ€™t know if I am just to full of myself or what am I doing wrong? Am I asking for too much? I just need a little bit of comfort like how I show to him? Is it all in my head? Why does this happen to me in different relationships is it me? 

I need an outside look on this. Please.",General_disorder
"Iâ€™ve been struggling with dysthymia with recurring episodes of major depression since I was 12. I didnâ€™t even plan on making it past the age of 18. 

In spite of all the pain I managed to be a very successful student. It was the only way I knew how to cope. But I eventually broke down halfway through college and my life has only gotten worse from there. I am fortunate enough to have a great family and their financial support, which I know many people donâ€™t have, but everything else has gone to shit since I dropped out. Itâ€™s too much to write about here. 

After going through 10+ medications and bad side effects (to put it mildly - one landed me in the hospital twice), I finally decided to try TMS last year. It actually helped for a couple months until a sudden life event caused yet another depressive episode. Iâ€™m fighting this one as hard as I can because I donâ€™t want to get to the point that I become bedridden again, but Iâ€™m just so tired. Iâ€™m now looking into ketamine treatment. If that doesnâ€™t work then probably psilocybin, if *that* doesnâ€™t work then ECT. I think the only thing left beyond ECT is deep brain stimulation. After that I donâ€™t think I can fight anymore. 

They say it gets better. And Iâ€™ve held onto that hope. But it really hasnâ€™t gotten better for me. Iâ€™m not sure it will. 

In all this time Iâ€™ve never made a serious attempt. I suppose because I feel it would be final if I went that route.

But I feel depressed most of the time like what Iâ€™m doing isnâ€™t good enough for myself but other people. I push people away. Friends, girlfriend, sometimes even family, because I feel like they donâ€™t understand life in the way that I do. Itâ€™s just weird I canâ€™t really explain it but it makes sense to me.

"So Iâ€™m looking for some practical advice on how to manage executive function disorder without using prescribed medications. 
Bit of background: I (39f) have been medically diagnosed with depression and several forms of anxiety disorders (EFD being one of them) and have been managing them for several years, but this seems to be the one thing I canâ€™t quite get a handle on. 
I have previously been on different medications for short periods of time when things got really bad and hated how they made me feel in a lot of ways both physically and psychologically. 

At work I have no issue whatsoever, itâ€™s almost like I have a separate work personality that takes over. Iâ€™m focused and hardworking, I can prioritise and time manage and even train other people how to do the same. Everyone knows me as the one whoâ€™s gets shit done. 

Itâ€™s when I get home that everything changes. I get distracted easily and lose track of time doing stupid shit like scrolling through social media or watching tv (often both at the same time). I put things off and tell myself Iâ€™ll do them later, and then that doesnâ€™t happen. Just for one example, Iâ€™ll neglect doing the dishes for two days and then order in because by that point I canâ€™t figure out where to start and the functional part of my brain gets overwhelmed and shuts down. 

So what Iâ€™m basically looking for is practical suggestions on ways I can maybe motivate myself and manage all the mundane stuff I donâ€™t really want to do but know I have to - you know, like laundry and dusting - methods, herbal remedies or supplements that anyone has had success with, maybe a meditation technique or type of physical activity or exercise. Maybe thereâ€™s an app for that, I dunno. I have no clue where to start, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m asking for help lol 

To be clear, Iâ€™m looking for things I can incorporate daily, not suggestions for therapists. Things others have found helpful that I can work on myself outside of CBT sessions that will help to reinforce it on a daily basis. Would really appreciate some suggestions",General_disorder
"I sometimes have this feeling that lasts few minutes where I feel better than others and I don't feel in low mood feeling that and also when I feel like that I don't feel like I care about others I don't feel guilty by it well this is the feeling I'm referring to 

Little bit off topic i guess but yet if I feel depressed then I will have some negative thoughts but I still won't feel like I care as much about others and watching people enjoy themselves is depressing even though I can feel happy not always for long though 

I don't really have interest for hobbies anymore I used to there are still some things I like doing but most things u haven't felt as much interest in

I sometimes don't feel like I have as much motivation to get things done but not always 

I'm also quite forgetful I literally will forget to do chores and things slip my mind this happens often maybe to often idk

"When I had my breakdown some years ago, I was put in hospital because I answered yes when the psychiatrist asked me if I heard voices. I didnâ€™t actually hear voices though, but had thoughts that were unusual for me at the time, that seemed to come from somewhere else.  Like listening to love songs and suddenly thinking with shock, that the lyrics were evil, and walking through the city and suddenly thinking it was full of sinners.  I was not a Christian and had not grown up in church, but my breakdown caused me to have lots of thoughts about the world and people that were scary and strange.  When I was in the psych ward lots of other people in there were also talking about God or the devil or angels.

"At the moment Iâ€™m just at my wits end. One of my main issues is that I fear abandonment and it absolutely destroys me when it does happen. Even the smallest cancellation of plans leaves me feeling abandoned. 

It started with my mom, who abandoned me when I was 7. I was taken away from her by police because the household was abusive and she gave up custody. 

I was abandoned by so many friends while In school. And at home, I was constantly dealing with my ever changing family. My dad was going from woman to woman and they all ended up leaving. The only constant throughout my entire life is my father, who Iâ€™ve come to realize was abusive as well. 

More recently, my ex wanted to break up with me, and my ex best friend broke things off with me while I was still living with her. 

And just today, my dad canceled plans on me yet again, my date got canceled, and I had to cut off one of my guy friends that Iâ€™d become really close to. Heâ€™d make any and every excuse not to hang out with me and I was tired of it. 

Im just so tired of this pattern. I canâ€™t trust anyone to stay in my life. I just let them leave, I donâ€™t force them to stay, but this is still driving me crazy. Iâ€™ve resorted to binge eating because I feel so empty rn.",General_disorder

"YT comments were one of the first places I started reaching out. I do a lot of posting on Twitter too, but not as much feedback on mental health stuff there. This is the start of my posting on Reddit. 
I started with social media because I didn't have any support in my day to day and the only place I could reach to was the internet. Which is a rough place when you're hanging by a thread. If you're reaching out on the internet, as hard as it can be if you have low self image, don't let that poison dilute the panacea. Take the responses that are helpful and ignore the rest.
If you want my crazy credentials, I have major depressive disorder(doing better so it may have changed) agoraphobia, unspecified anxiety disorder (aka it's too complex for them to put a neat bow on itðŸ˜‹) social anxiety, and I forget the other crap off the top of my head.
Take care and be well! I hope you find the guidance and inspiration you need to get well!
P.s. I say inspiration because healing is a very personal thing, even if a technique may be helpful to you, there's some inspiration involved in fitting it into your system. On that note, don't try to fit too much into your system at once, just add 1 new tool and make sure it works then add the next. It took me years to realize that while some of the tools I was using worked, I had mashed them all together at once and it was just a mess. So I wound up starting over from scratch, which was overall helpful. At the time though it felt like I had wasted three years of my life.

"The best advice I can give here is work on cognitive awareness. As the anxiety/depression hits try and recognize all the thoughts going on and work at finding which triggers that response. If things get fuzzy(or your too depressed to find the energy) when the anxiety/depression hits, when your mind calms a bit and you feel better try to remember what you were thinking. It can be a slow process, if it's severe it might take a year or 2 to get the hang of it(it took me about 3 years). I'd recommend looking into cognitive therapy techniques for reframing tools, or if your more spiritual, pathworking techniques.
Social Anxiety- if it happens a lot with friends, you might want to reevaluate the friendship. Not saying end things unless it's actually toxic but if your working on bettering yourself and they're content to stay they same as when you became friends the conflict within could be as simple as falling into your old patterns when around them and your mind being confused since you've been working on changing, and if it's a group it could just be one person triggering things. if thats the case and you value that group, let your friends know you need to work on yourself a bit and work on your personal boundaries so that the one person doesn't ruin the whole group for you. If they're good friends they'll still be there when you're comfortable coming back. 
Depression- So it sounds easy to say, but it's hard to do especially if it's severe and long lasting, but reframing and self image are the base of remodeling a depressed foundation. It's taken me years to get to a point where I can barely count the minutes in a month that I desire to cease existence and not the hours in a day I longed for death to take me. 
Self image technique I use: every morning and night, look into a mirror smile and tell yourself ""I love all parts of us/me"" however you want to phrase it. It was easier for me at first to refer to the mirror and myself as us. It was easier for me to express love for my reflection than to express it for myself. The smile is important also. It took me a year to stop feeling silly and like a liar, and about another year to start believing what I was saying.
Reframing technique: find one solid image that makes you feel positive, for me it was my dog. When doing something and you start to feel depressed focus on that image as strongly as your able. If the image starts to get tarnished by the depression, spend some of your ""up"" time doing that thing or with that person to strengthen the positivity of it.
Deeper reframing is really time consuming and can be difficult, and it takes a fair bit of self awareness.
Example: My agoraphobia was very bad at this point, I was managing maybe 1-2 hours a month away from the house. Mainly to get groceries once a month. The panic attack would lead into a major depressive episode. I don't have electricity, so I could only keep milk a couple days in a cooler. So the only times I drank milk for a long time was during a major depressive episode. 1 day I was having a great day, and feeling good. I also had milk on hand. So I poured a glass and was sitting with my dog and about halfway through the glass I was feeling really depressed. I couldn't figure it out, things were going well I hadn't had a panic attack why was I so down so suddenly. After probably 6-8 hours of thinking about it I realized I had made a pavlovian response linking milk to depression  mind you that wasn't my first conclusion. I thought through everything from someone drugged my milk(it was in a cooler outside so still crazy, but not as crazy as one would think), to radio waves from the nearby radio station before it occured to me I had just formed an emotional trigger between milk and my depressive episodes. I then spent probably 16 hours total going through my memory and disassociating the emotion from the act of drinking milk. I mostly did this by using positive imagery to basically counter the negative emotional state. I'm still working on a better way of explaining that process.

"Hi everyone. I'll start by saying that I don't want to romanticise mental health issues or anything like that -- and if it looks like I do, I'm sorry, that's not my intention. You are free to tell me that I'm just exaggerating things. Maybe I am - that's why I'm asking in the first place.

I have had a serious panic attack some days ago and one of my friends who helped me get through it told me I should talk to a psychologist or a psychiatrist. At first I thought it was nothing serious, but I am now trying to study a bit about mental health and I find many symptoms of social anxiety, MDD, AvDP or BDP extremely relatable. I have talked to a psychologist that my school makes available for the students freely and started crying in the middle of the session (it is very difficult for me to talk even to my closest friends). While talking I realised that many things I have always considered ""normal"" or just part of my personality have had a huge impact in my development and still cause me considerable impairment and discomfort in social life. 

However, I have never had any serious symptoms (psychotic/delusional nor suicide attempts, although I have had many suicidal thoughts throughout my life) and sometimes I happen to feel genuinely happy (I think), although I have extreme and rapid mood swings. But most of the time, I would just like not to feel anything at all. I feel like there is a thin wall of ice between me and everyone else and I just can't be comfortable unless I'm alone. But when I'm alone I feel loneliness. I'm starting to hate myself for all of this thinking.

Honestly, I don't know what to do. I have been obsessed with this for the last few days. I'm worried that I may be just exaggerating normal negative reactions to justify myself with others or to seek their attention. I found myself in the position of hoping for my psychologist to suggest a possible diagnosis -- I think that would make me feel less alone right now and may also alleviate some of this burden (I constantly blame myself for not being able to be happy and a diagnosis could finally convince me that this is none of my fault).

I'm confused. What should I do? Should I wait some time and see how it goes? Or should I take action as soon as possible? For sure, I will continue to see the school psychologist 30 mins a week. I'm less than 18 and seeking professional help would mean having to explain to my parents that I'm not ""ok"" and that panic attacks are not my main and only issue. And it's also a considerable investment in terms of time and money. If it means anything, there is high familiarity with both depressive and psychotic disorders among my first-degree relatives.

Also, when does one consider switching from a psychologist to a psychiatrist? Is it something that can be done even without severe symptoms? Does it usually follow a recommendation?

Thank you for reading and for your help. Sorry if it looks like I'm an egoistic idiot trying to capture attention. I'm just genuinely worried for myself. I want to feel better.",General_disorder

I have strong healthy boundaries that I express in healthy ways.
I am grateful that the worst moments are past.
I am grateful that every moment is better than the last.
Every moment in every way I'm better and better and better

Over the years I've added some more personal stuff, that's more specific to me. 

When I was at my worst, I started with telling myself I love you at least once a day and it was too much trouble many days. It took 6-8 months before I could do it everyday. Once I was able to do it every morning, I started doing it at night too. I found it helpful to do it in a mirror while smiling (at first it was mostly a fake smile). 
I kept a mirror by the bed, because going all the way to the bathroom to say I love you was too much effort for something I didn't yet believe.

"When I was younger, I was very sheltered. I was entirely homeschooled and not allowed to do much outside of the house. While homebound, I was abused by the primary caretaker, my uncle. Since I didn't attend school, most of what I learned about society and being around people came from TV and video games.


During puberty, my attention-seeking behavioral issues increased, and I started to act out in ways that would emotionally hurt others. Even though I knew it would hurt them, it didn't feel like it mattered, since everyone outside of me was an NPC or 'extra'.


As I aged I continued to have this problem, but I learned slowly that other people are real and have real feelings. That didn't stop my outbursts, though; only this time, after the damage was done, intense guilt always followed. (Also to note: I would sort of space out before and during these outbursts, and I'd feel this odd suspension of belief like a video game. It was only afterwards when I'd ""wake up"" and I'd realize what I'd done, I'd freak out.)


After some therapy, medication, and self-help, I've come a long way regarding boundaries, other people's emotions, the consequences of my actions, etc. But I'm haunted by my past behavior and how people felt alien to me, like unconsequential playthings.

Hi. I am a bit concerned about my brother and wanted to ask for advice because my parents are not very helpful and my sister agrees with everything they say. 

He likes weapons, plays violent games, stuff like that. He also has conservative political views, does not respect women very much, and wants to enroll in the military. I don't believe that these things make him a violent person. He is a teenager, after all. I only wanted to give you guys context. 

Yesterday, around midnight, he was messing around in our attic as he often does (he plays piano in there), and a bat started to bother him. So he caught the bat and smashed its ribcage with his bare hands until the bat died. He seemed to think it was all fine and dandy because he cleaned everything up afterward and even felt it was a bit funny. I told him that wasn't normal behavior and got very upset by the whole thing. My sister joked around as if it weren't a big deal, and my mom was more upset by me ""making a scene"" and ruining her lunch than by what my brother did. She even used the ""boys will be boys"" excuse. 

Still a little bit better than my dad, who said it didn't matter because the bat was a pest, and my brother had to kill it however he could at the time. I managed to convince my mom to talk to my brother, but only after a lot of struggle. She still thinks I was overreacting and somehow made the whole thing about how she isn't supposed to solve all of our problems because we are already old enough to take care of stuff.

"To start of this account doesnâ€™t have a lot of Karma because itâ€™s a new one. Iâ€™d like to stay anonymous. And Iâ€™ll be posting this across multiple platforms and subreddits. It took me an hour to gather my thoughts about this. I wrote this text on the 8th of march.
Iâ€™m a 16 year old guy (turning 17 in 4 months) with a Kenyan mom and a Cameroonian dad. My parents are strict when it comes to where I hang out and when. I donâ€™t have a lot of friends fr. I have one real Friend that I can meet and talk to but she lives 1 1/2 hours away by train. Im just an acquaintance to most other people. I have a few Internet friends who live far away that I talk to sometimes tho but it just isnâ€™t the sameâ€¦

The thing thatâ€™s been bothering me is that I feel lonely and disconnected from anything thatâ€™s happening in real life. I wonâ€™t feel sad or lonely unless something triggers it. Itâ€™s like everytime I remeber my situation I just start feeling bad and sometimes it gets really bad. But after a day or two Iâ€™ll feel normal again and just suck it up. Following triggered that feeling again: 
Former Classmate is turning 17 and moved to another city one year ago. To be exact cologne. It isnâ€™t going to be a huuuuuge party so no taking drugs or anything. 
10 People are coming and theyâ€™re gonna go bowling. I live 1 1/2 hours away by train so they offered to drive me there cuz another friend from my city is also going. Only problem is theyâ€™re gonna start bowling at 8pm, theyâ€™ll be done at 11:30 and I have to be home by 10PM. I usually have to be home by 8:30PM on weekends with exceptions (like this birthday). Because of my curfew I wonâ€™t be able to go there. Itâ€™s sad since this couldâ€™ve been a great opportunity to make new friends yk.

This is just an example of the type of things that trigger me. Social media does it too tho. When I see people I know being outside with their friends and stuff I just feel miserable and pathetic cuz the only thing I do when I come home is go to football practice or sit at my desk for hours forgetting to eat while making beats. I never talked to anybody about my feelings except one girl a month ago or sum. But we stopped talking so I donâ€™t feel comfortable sharing this with anyone because I feel like Iâ€™m just gonna be a burden. Especially because Iâ€™m still getting to know the person Iâ€™m talking to rn. Which is also a internet friend.

Im typing this text with tears in my eyes itâ€™s kinda hard. Even though I know that latest tomorrow evening I will have crammed this whole matter somewhere into the back of my mind.

I donâ€™t know what to do! I just feel so helpless like all of this is just going to continue until Iâ€™m eventually old enough to move out. I donâ€™t even know if my feelings are justified which might be the reason Iâ€™m not taking this so serious. Because I always keep thinking that if it was that bad I wouldnâ€™t be smiling at day or laughing with people. Iâ€™ve had a lot of thoughts about just k*lling myself but I know I donâ€™t have the balls to do it so thereâ€™s no need to worry. 
Iâ€™ve been feeling like this for a year now maybe longer but it just keeps getting worse. Itâ€™s come to a point where I feel like I donâ€™t want this to stop. Iâ€™m just bathing in self pitty rn.

Another thing thatâ€™s been bothering me for a long time is the fact that I talk to myself in my head. Itâ€™s kinda like therapy. I just feel like somebodyâ€™s listening to me and understand me yk. Itâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing rn. But this shit I driving me insane cuz I know itâ€™s important to talk to actual people so thatâ€™s the reason why Iâ€™m gonna post this. Iâ€™m gonna create a new account tho cuz I donâ€™t wann anybody irl to find out about this. It would be embarrassing af.

Anyway I think Iâ€™m done with venting so I kinda wanna hear your thoughts about this. Iâ€™m sry if I sound crazy I donâ€™t even know myself anymore.

Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m sassy complaining about not being allowed to be outside after 8 PM. Itâ€™s just my head. Itâ€™s fucking with me.

I even act different around the house. I feel like thereâ€™s a bunch of people I know watching me everyday, everysecond. When I go to  shower in the shower cabin I donâ€™t even feel comfortable anymore because I feel like thereâ€™s people watching me get naked and stuff. Or when Iâ€™m using the toilet. Or eating. Basically everything.

Yk my online friends all got a life. They got friends irl too not like me. So when theyâ€™re busy doing their things (understandable) It kinda does something with me.

The reason why Iâ€™m jumping from Point to point is because I keep remembering things I forgot.

I donâ€™t know where to start. Itâ€™s just to much.

Edit (12th March) : Today I was in a relatively good mood making breakfast until my father started yelling and complaining about me leaving my window open in my room (I forget things a lot). The things is once he points something out he just keeps going and lists everything in doing wrong. At some point it just got too much and when he was done talking I left the kitchen and went up in my room till he was done. I noticed that my hands were shaking and my breathing was inconsistent. I just started crying. I went back down when he was done and wanted to sit down at the table but when I saw my father next room I just started tearing up again so now Iâ€™m in the living room where I canâ€™t see him and Iâ€™ve been tearing up the entire time. Iâ€™m still shaking. That was 1 hour ago.",General_disorder

So Iâ€™ve been having some sort of paranoid delusions since age 11, only recently realized they started back thenâ€¦ not currently delusional to my knowledge.

i got a diagnosis (in quote marks; because itâ€™s a symptom not a disorder) psychosis NOS from a psychiatrist specialized in adolescent psychiatry (iâ€™m 17)

Anyway I am very impulsive (spending everything on dumb â– â– â– â–  when ever I have the opportunity to, aggressive sometimes etc.), feeling empty/boredom , mood swings

Another psychiatrist has suggested I have something like mania/bipolar but I donâ€™t really relate with itâ€¦

My aunt once thought I seemed similar to my schizo/bipolar cousin who was around 28 at the time (I was 13) when I had a â€meltdown/episodeâ€ of a kind (I was very out of it, hurting others and got almost ran over by a car, others were threatening me with admitting me to a ward/calling the police etc) could i have bpd",General_disorder
As anyone noticed this I can't ignore no matter how small the sound or light movement is. For example if someone is moving their pen and i can't ignore that and i will be bothered by it in class same goes for sounds and even people just changing a little movement I am tired of this. I am tired of hearing people 4 seats  away from me open or close their bag. I am tired of noticing someone moving their feet. I don't know I don't feel good and i get tired.,General_disorder

Guys I need some advice, Iâ€™m feeling really stuck in life. 

Iâ€™m in a pretty stressful financial situation. On top of this, Iâ€™m trying to manage anxiety, depression, OCD and an eating disorder as well as chronic pain. 

Picking up more shifts is difficult for a few reasons: Iâ€™m in constant pain, my body is very fatigued because of my eating disorder, work makes me stressed because of my own insecurities so I get too overwhelmed to eat which makes my mental health worse. Because I donâ€™t have a lot of money I canâ€™t afford physiotherapy and can barely afford therapy and medication. I also really need to move out of where Iâ€™m living because the conditions are pretty bad and are a huge cause of my OCD which lead to my eating disorder which is causing most of my mental health issues, but I canâ€™t afford to because everywhere else is so much more expensive. 

I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore, I feel completely stuck and feel like thereâ€™s no winning option here. Moving back to live with my parents is not an option. Iâ€™ve had to drop out of university because my mental, physical, and financial health is just too much. I applied to a few dog walking sites hoping for some extra cash but havenâ€™t gotten any work there. 

What should I do? Any advice would be amazing.

"I want to be alone literally all the time when Iâ€™m not doing something, like at work or the grocery store or school, etc. (I donâ€™t mind being around ppl then). But Iâ€™m lonely and empty deep inside and I know itâ€™s not good for my already bad mental health. Why then do I hate socializing so much and turn down every invitation even when I promise myself I will go? What do you think is my problem and what do I do? 

I wish I could just have fun and be normal. I hate what my life is but I donâ€™t actually want to do the things that I fantasize about (have a friend group, relationships, travel, go to stuff etc.) I am really embarrassed by what Iâ€™ve become. I donâ€™t even know why I feel this way. I like people but donâ€™t want to be around them. I just feel very alone and lost and dead inside. 

I do try to socialize sometimes and everyone is so nice and honestly meet tons of people would be ideal friends if I put just a little effort but every time Iâ€™m invited somewhere I canâ€™t think of anything I want to do less. I kind of hate myself for it. Iâ€™m so incredibly boring and lazy and serious and standoffish honestly.

"Thereâ€™s a few things but first, every time I cry (which is rarely) I almost immediately stop and I canâ€™t feel anything. No anxiety, no depression, no happiness. I feel like all of my emotions have literally disappeared and everything and everyone I love I donâ€™t care about anymore. It can last from a few seconds to a day but I eventually start to feel like myself again. 
     Another thing is Iâ€™m very untrusting of my friends. I mean I trust them but if (for example) they donâ€™t respond to me in a few hours I immediately get this idea that they hate me. That theyâ€™re plotting against me or planning an evil scheme or whatever. I get super sad and pity myself and then Iâ€™m suddenly Iâ€™m like â€œI donâ€™t need them, I donâ€™t need anyoneâ€ and then theyâ€™ll write back or whatever and Iâ€™m suddenly like â€œoh silly me aha Iâ€™m so impatient ahaâ€. I havenâ€™t told anyone my thoughts so no one knows. But it doesnâ€™t matter how many times I tell myself to be patient and not to be dramatic, I still always do it. Whatâ€™s worse is that I often donâ€™t respond to my friends for a few days, even a few weeks, so Iâ€™m also a hypocrite. It doesnâ€™t matter how much time I spend with them and how much they tell me they love me, when Iâ€™m in the moment I truly believe that theyâ€™re faking a friendship with me.

I can feel the separation of myself and my thoughts. I can feel my soul inside of me and I can feel the difference. I probably sound crazy but I feel it so strongly and I don't know what to do. I also think I have something called visual snow syndrome but right now it's worse than usual and when I look at anything, all that I can see is grain. I feel like I'm living inside of a staticky TV. I feel no connection to anything. I've always lacked a connection with human beings as a whole and now I lack one with my own self. I feel like I could do anything and that it just wouldn't matter. I feel so free but so trapped at the same time. My life has consequences but they wouldn't be real if I could just figure out how to break out.

"So this might sound odd but when I'm outside and only when I'm outside I feel like I'm being watched and have to look about fairly often because of it, and if I don't I get really uncomfortable like pulling my hair out more often than usual, just feeling tense, almost unable to move although I obviously can i just don't know how to explain it accurately.

I've noticed this isn't as bad at night time but it is still very bad and so when I need to do anything outside I do it at night bc it is less stressful.

I dont know if this has any effect but around the time I was sent to my cmht one time I was running home because I felt like I was being followed and was crying at the same time, this part to me is still really embarrassing and I try to pretend it never happened.

I'm a 13 going on 14 I'm not even sure if how I would feel if I were to hurt someone which I don't want to nor have a urge but if I did idk if I'd feel anything from it 


I used to not lie as much now I keep lying to my mom about things not I never lied years ago just not as often who knows maybe what I'm saying is not actuate 


I had intrusive thoughts to harm others but they disappeared again because this has happened where there present for months and leave for months and cone back but who cares if they come back because who knows maybe it will teach me to care because I felt anxious by them and wasn't happy with myself thinking about that stuff and sometimes tried to push them away and probably ruimnated on them for like hour 


And more about my mental health at 11 I started to feel depressed for like every day but I would most days have moment of being happy but not always that long then back to that mental state again and had some negative thoughts and eventually lost interest in hobbies there was a hobby I was interested in but never got to try it

 and later on towards the end of 2021 I wasn't as depressed but still didn't have interest in hobbies and still negative thoughts still sometimes didn't have much motivation and lost interest in the hobby I wanted to try still don't have interest for it still sometimes had some depressed moments not as many but still could feel happy 


And few days ago I started to feel depressed again once again still don't have interest in hobbies still can feel happy and sometimes don't have much motivation but still can have motivation to complete things still have some negative thought but I sometimes tell them to shut up or I just let them bother me 

I was years ago by psychologist diagnosed with autism but I don't really think I quite relate with the symptoms of autism but I'm not to well educated on it so maybe there is something I'm missing because I kinda have holes in my memory 

And I am quite forgetful like I literally forget to do chores often 

I guess if you gave questions about this you can ask 


I don't have a therapist I didn't really explain much to my parents about my mental health my dad offered me to get help from a professional but who knows my mental health signs are just part of being a teenager

"Hello. I'm 18 years old and I've had this problem since I was, like, 15: 

&amp;#x200B;

So, when I'm completely alone, I do this weird thing: I stress my muscles really hard and try to shake/vibrate my body; I try to keep a ""rhythm"". Also, I do something similar to coughing but not quite coughing, it's more like clearing my throat intentionally in a certain rhythm, or something. I also make weird noises in the same period. I don't stop until it feels ""right"". After all is done, I put my hand on my chest to feel my heartbeat, and it's almost always beating like crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, it's almost completely intentional. I obviously don't do this in public (it's creepy as hell) and I only do it once I scanned the room for any cameras/monitoring devices. I do it randomly but mostly when I'm in an emotional state (especially when I'm angry or excited). I do it because I feel like I *need* to do it, and that I won't settle until I do it.

&amp;#x200B;

So uh, the question here is: What the fuck is wrong with me? I tried googling but, heck, where do you even start to describe this weird shit? As far as my research went, it's not a nervous system issue since I have control over it; I figured that it probably has something to do with my mental health, or anything related to that.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to tell my family about it but I didn't, and that's because I thought they'd tell me something like: ""What? you're not mentally ill!"" or ""You're not crazy!"", and since they're pretty religious, ""Maybe you should ask for God's guidance. It could be a demon, or something.""

I went to a doctor a while ago (it was a routine visit but I thought I'd mention this). So I described the thing. I don't remember exactly what our conversation was but we concluded that it was a vitamin D deficiency thing.

"This is gonna sound crazy, probably. But Iâ€™m a content creator in a rather huge fandom. I write fan fiction (a hobby that really does help me when Iâ€™m having a bad time) I also have a decent amount of Twitter followers on the account connected to all my fics.

I had an account on this anonymous messaging app called CuriousCat, eventually I started to get a lot of hate, over posts, what i write, etc.

And it become kind of a toxic habit, I would obsessively check the inbox, and almost eagerly await the next horrible message so that I could reply to it.

Eventually with the support of a few friends, I deleted the app and my account on said app, all together, and the hate has since stopped. Besides a few of my friends within the fandom getting hate messages about me.

But the thing isâ€¦ I kind of.. miss the attention? even though it was incredibly negative and sometimes accusing me of things I hadnâ€™t done.
Even though sometimes the hate, would be hurtful and horrible.

"I donâ€™t understand what Iâ€™m feeling. I almost always have a deep feeling of loneliness, unlike others Iâ€™m not ignorant to the brutal nature of humans, they give you all that affection and attention simply to get something back, and if they donâ€™t get it they leave. None of them will love, they all use, their love is never unconditional, and Iâ€™ll always be alone In this sense. 

I have people who love me, no doubt, but they rarely show or say this directly, nor do they offer support although they have recognised by increasingly antisocial behaviour. I have become unreactive, I often find myself daydreaming about practically nothing, Iâ€™m never particularly sad as there is nothing to be sad about, just I feel as if this realisation of what has always been there has meant I have a lost a part of myself. But that same person comes back in the gym, when drinking with friends, or even alone. Then Iâ€™m focused, or careless, nothing matters, reality doesnâ€™t apply. Itâ€™s probably the only thing keeping me going. 

The world around me almost puts me in a third person perspective. Itâ€™s like confusion but I understand whatâ€™s happening. They way people play along with the flirting that gets them nowhere, the way people are angered by the simplest of words. People are so naive. I cannot comprehend why they care for such things. I cannot comprehend myself. Some days Iâ€™m normal, and increasing amount of others I am not. I block myself out from things thatâ€™ll likely hurt me, other times I donâ€™t, but I can never distinguish which is the right choice. Some days when I am not I want to feel like shit, I want love, I want attention. But the days I am I just want to be left alone, people point it out and I wish they didnâ€™t. I wish they didnâ€™t exist on those days. I cannot even begin to try and guess what the fuck is wrong with me.",General_disorder

Hi everyone! 

A classmate and I are interested in determining whether or not the public believes those diagnosed with mental health disorders can accurately recall critical events from the past to further predict the innocence or guilt of another human being in criminal court. By taking our survey, you will anonymously allow us to determine the community's perception regarding those mentally diagnosed, their accuracy levels, and the importance of reliably testifying as an eyewitness in court. We appreciate your participation and look forward to reviewing our results.

"I donâ€™t understand, why I had to pull the short stick in this world and have such a difficult burden put into my head when everyone else is living life with normal problems, not having to worry about having delusionsâ€¦ or outlandish thoughts swarm my psyche and force me to walk around like a 2 ton boulder on top of my head",General_disorder
"So I have performance based anxiety. And it's pretty severe. I've got a lot of triggers but I'm working through them. This is one of the bigger ones and there's a lot of moving parts to this. It's gonna be a bit of a read...but any and all help would be appreciated if you can get through reading this post lol. (Apologies in advance.)

So about my performance anxiety surrounding job searching...I've been fired and/or let go from every job that I've had because I've tried to do things a better way. (Often, it's a different way because I have ADHD and I work differently and my bosses don't like it. They don't like me reinventing or tweaking the work process even though it harms no one or that I'm showing them up.) It feels like I'm fucking up when I get let go, naturally. But now whenever I go job searching I get bad panic attacks or just flat out freeze in front of the computer screen. I can't even get to finishing applications. Which, to my brain, feels like another failure, feeding the anxiety. 

(Sidenote: I know I'm logically not screwing up that badly because I talk to my former co-workers. People love me and those who work underneath me always tell me I did a good job, that they were sad when I left, that I often went above and beyond what was asked of me and that sh*t hits the fan whenever I go. Always the same pattern. I just have shit luck with awful bosses lol and it's still hard to shake that feeling of failure.)

I didn't finish college or university so that's an added anxiety on top of it all. It's harder to find a job without  those qualifications even though I've got a lot of experience...but it brings back those feelings of regret and failure for dropping out even though it was probably the right thing to do for my mental health. Feeds the anxiety. 

On top of all this, I feel like I'm letting my partner down even though they constantly reassure me they'll stand by my side. It's been a few months of me being stuck. They make enough money to support us and I just got my employment insurance come through, so that helps. But still, the idea I'm letting them down...it's hard to disarm that. Feeds the anxiety.

And throughout ALL of that, I'm constantly fighting my ADHD brain. There are several days when I feel bad or awful and I procrastinate because my ADHD brain just checks out mentally, even with my meds. And then I wind up on the couch or just doing house chores. And then I feel bad because I know I got some life stuff done but not what I really need to get done. I.e. I'm not managing my ADHD well. Feeds the anxiety. Which feeds the ADHD (because I've come to learn that anxiety tends to make my symptoms more frequent and worse and the urge to do something less stressful becomes stupidly strong and I end up giving in). Which feeds the anxiety because I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing. It's a vicious cycle.

I've tried a lot of CBT and DBT techniques. They all help a bit. But not enough to get over the hurdle. I can't possibly be the only person who's felt like a bum in this way, so I'm genuinely curious how people have gotten over this sort of thing.",General_disorder

I'm a 13 going on 14 I'm not even sure if how I would feel if I were to hurt someone which I don't want to nor have a urge but if I did idk if I'd feel anything from it 


I used to not lie as much now I keep lying to my mom about things not I never lied years ago just not as often who knows maybe what I'm saying is not actuate 


I had intrusive thoughts to harm others but they disappeared again because this has happened where there present for months and leave for months and cone back but who cares if they come back because who knows maybe it will teach me to care because I felt anxious by them and wasn't happy with myself thinking about that stuff and sometimes tried to push them away and probably ruimnated on them for like hour 


And more about my mental health at 11 I started to feel depressed for like every day but I would most days have moment of being happy but not always that long then back to that mental state again and had some negative thoughts and eventually lost interest in hobbies there was a hobby I was interested in but never got to try it

 and later on towards the end of 2021 I wasn't as depressed but still didn't have interest in hobbies and still negative thoughts still sometimes didn't have much motivation and lost interest in the hobby I wanted to try still don't have interest for it still sometimes had some depressed moments not as many but still could feel happy 


And few days ago I started to feel depressed again once again still don't have interest in hobbies still can feel happy and sometimes don't have much motivation but still can have motivation to complete things still have some negative thought but I sometimes tell them to shut up or I just let them bother me 

I was years ago by psychologist diagnosed with autism but I don't really think I quite relate with the symptoms of autism but I'm not to well educated on it so maybe there is something I'm missing because I kinda have holes in my memory 

And I am quite forgetful like I literally forget to do chores often 

I guess if you gave questions about this you can ask 


I don't have a therapist I didn't really explain much to my parents about my mental health my dad offered me to get help from a professional but who knows my mental health signs are just part of being a teenager 

Unless this is something with environment  I'm in online school temporarily I don't really hang out with toxic friends or things like that 

Idk if these things have to do with it just my case my mental health shouldn't be a excuse",General_disorder

"Hello, wanna clarify that I'm not asking for a diagnosis but just some insight. I've had different obsessive habits since childhood. At first I was just biting my nails then stopped after a few months and my mom said its just one of those things kids make a habit of then stop. But then I got another habit of playing with my lower lip, that continued for a long while then I stopped it and got into cracking my fingers constantly, then stopped after a few years and started pulling my hair etc etc. 

Basically since I was a kid Ive always had one obsessive behaviour like this or another nonstop, everytime I get rid of one of these habits I start another one. I've tried stopping multiple times and I resist the urge for a week or two maximum then start doing it again.

Do you know anyone that does this? I havent seen or heard of it. Not sure what its called either so I could research more into it and stop.",General_disorder
"Hello everybody.

Please dont laugh or disrespect as I know this is very stupid but it has destroyed my life.

I want to share my story for the past few years which I know to some is just something that they wont care about, but I've come to a point where I've had enough . The topic is something I cant disclose to family as it is a matter related to religion. I am very ashamed of this but because this is anonymous I thought I'd share.

It started on the night of an exam where I was so stressed I could not fall asleep at all. During the following day? I was so tired and drowsy due to the fact I hadnt slept at all. This developed into a phobia where I was stressed I wont fall asleep and due to the stress this happened . Because I wanted so hard to fall asleep to do well in exams , I couldn't sleep at night. After exams finished this experience alleviated but again returned when I had to start my college. My brain brought this trauma back everytime I knew I need full attention and energy. Because i wanted to do well in studies , my brain brought the thought that if i cant sleep i cant do well and i will fail in all aspects of my life. 
To combat this I developed an approach where I would convince I will die if I sleep , and this helpt me sleep at night. This was a repeating cycle every day. I had to convince myself I would die that night , and I was so convinced that I could no longer plan for the future, for example meeting friends. 

This went along until I spoke to my parents about this. Speaking about this helped, but yet I was always bombarded by thoughts that I cant sleep at night. 

As I tried combatting this, one day I my father who is very religious spoke about a quranic verse which is along the lines of : ""god takes away the soul at night during sleep "" .  The way my brain interpreted this was that god controls my sleep (CAN YOU IMAGINE), and so my sleep is in his hands. This was worsened when I came across a quote from the islamic prophet that stated god took your souls as he willed and returned them as he willed in the context of his companions who described their sleep at a particular time. 
At this time I was horriefied: this thought that god controls my sleep and so I cant sleep unless he willed was brought about due to myself being very religious and also due to this mental condition alone. 
Because I kept searching about these things i came across a verse in the psalms which says ""god gives sleep to those whom he likes"". 

Due to me being religious and also Islamic teachings which state god is in control of everything , I felt hopeless. The only way I could combat this was to refute islam and the psalms , to convince my self these arent divine , and so no external force can control my sleep. So all of this just to be able to sleep at night. To do this I would look for errors in these scriptures to satisfy my ""atheism"". 

However my brain combatted this approach by trying to prove these scriptures are divine , and so god is in control of my sleep just to stop me from sleeping. For example it would make me search for scientfic miracles in the quran just so I accept islam and so the same thought that god controls my sleep comes back. This would occur on a daily basis , and has been happening for the past 2 years , making my life like hell. I had to refute claims made by my own mind  which tried to say islam is divine just to be able to sleep at night.

These thoughts could come during the night meaning I would have to look for reputations in the middle of the night.
This is why I cant disclose this to my family as if they find out I exited the religion , they would be extremely angry and you know what happens if someone leaves islam.


As an extra point, I have been taking medication for years mainly celexa which did help in reducing these thoughts but the effect went away which is why I'm at this point now. 

Today for example , my mother described a dream she had which is a reflection of something described in islam , but she had never heard about before. This has obviously prompted the thought that islam is divine and true, and so the same though has come back again that god is in control of my sleep and unless he wills I cant sleep at any time. 

I hope this makes sense. Yes I know you may laugh as this sounds ridiculous, but it has completely destroyed my life. I've not been able to socialise properly and sleep has always been in the back of my head. The part where religion came in made it 10 times worse. I've had to fight myself every day just to be able to sleep at night. 

I dont know what to do anymore. I think this will stick with me for the rest of my life. I dont think I could get married as nobody would want to live with a maniac with such a mental condition .

I have had suicidal thoughts many and many times and what makes it worse I cant tell anyone.  All I hope is I die soon, as this is the best option

All I wish is if somebody could help me or miraculously remove this experience from me ðŸ˜ª

"I have been having paranoid thoughts (for a year now) that my father is SA me every night in my sleep. I often get unwanted ideas (or intrusive thoughts) about ""it"" during the day that make my body tremble/shiver, and somehow cannot stop it. I feel really uncomfortable around him. 

Any ideas why/Advice?",General_disorder
I'm always telling myself things are so much worse than they are. If someone who I have an interest in doesn't talk to me for a few days then I tell myself that they hate me and never want to speak to me again and that they have completely lost interest in me. This leads me to ask them if they still like me and I often end up making myself look crazy. If my friends are busy with something and can't talk to me then I tell myself that they aren't my friends and that they're all sick of me. If someone leaves my messages on read then I breakdown. I know it's irrational but my thoughts spiral so quickly and I can't stop them. My brain tells me to leave people before they've even done anything wrong but I stay anyway and put myself through so much pain. I'm causing all of the pain by myself. I cry over this so often and then I don't want to leave my bed anymore or do anything. Sometimes it's like I mentally put myself through breakups before I was ever even in the relationship(and this applies to friendships too). It gets really hard not to hurt myself whenever I feel all of these things because my sadness is just too overwhelming to deal with. I feel so guilty for being like this and I feel like I don't deserve to be treated well by anyone.,General_disorder
"So ive recently moved to a new town and in our new neighbourhood theres this 10 year old girl, I thought she was 13-14 at first and so did my parents and grandparents she just looks and talks like shes older, anyway the day we move to the new house she comes up and knocks to give us a halloween party invitation. At this point i thought of her as a ghost kind of like I didnt really acknolage her because I didnt know her very well. At the party we get to talking and turns out shes interesting and fun to talk to. For the past 4-5 months ive been going to her house at least twice a week since she has a little brother that likes to play with my 2 little brothers and Im in charge of watching them. Ive noticed I think about her more everyday and on the days when I dont see her I get depression that lasts until the next time I see her, the days I see her I feel fine and enjoy life. Also I need to add I never think about her sexually as I just cant shes beautiful but not in that way I love her looks and personality but I dont get turned on or anything.

"I have been feeling like this for 3 years now. My anxiety goes through the roof. I guess Iâ€™ll try to make it make sense. Letâ€™s say, if I watch a Minecraft video. I know it sounds stupid. My brain will try to trick me and make me feel like an antisocial 12 year old who worships Minecraft videos who cannot socialize at all and that tickling thought brings me so much anxiety that my hands start to sweat, it gets hard to think and watching any YouTube video becomes absolute hell. This generalization goes over everything. If I watch a video about maps or chess or anything. To fix these thoughts that give me anxiety I have to delete the videos in my history. No problem. Then this weird mental disease messes with me by the people who I talk with. I know this sounds weird, but if I talk to an introvert my mind messes me with me again and says I can never be comfortable talking to anybody ever again and then it becomes true. I genuinely cannot become comfortable talking to become unless I stop talking to THAT person. But generally speaking the people I want to become friends with(the ones that donâ€™t induce intrusive thoughts) are rude and disrespectful.

"I have OCD, a tasteful dose of autism, newly acquired PTSD and apparently GAD. Top it off with the usual dose of ADHD and you have what I like to think of as an endless pool of suffering. Let me explain. The OCD causes me to constantly think back to a panic attack I had while driving (PTSD from experience). Which causes a compulsion too distract myself. Usually it's video games or something easy... Like reading stuff on Reddit... Porn, drugs.
Anyway add the dose of autism to make it so that it's near impossible for me to ask for help or make friends. I have a hard time expressing these troubles I rarely do. The GAD was my most recent diagnosis. It's been 3 years since that accident and since I still haven't worked or even really gone outside... I know yikes... I don't go to therapy. With my issues I grew up in therapy. I was troubled youth for obvious reasons. After a certain amount of therapy you start to hear the same things. I had over ten years of therapy before I was 20.

"BPD, ASD, ADHD, C-PTSD, depression, social anxiety, generalised anxiety. What the fuck.

I feel like I've tried every route. Socialising, meditation, working out, therapist, psychologist, specialized psychologist, SSRIs, SNRI, a cocktail of narcotics, sleeping, eating healthy, positive attitude, finding occupation to fill free time with.

What I've come out with in the end: Gambling addiction, &gt;!suicidal ideations!&lt;, drug addiction (although 4 weeks sober as of now, mostly due to being broke), broken relationships with family or I mean they were broken before but now they're extremely broken. Hurt friends by ghosting or telling them to fuck off during bipolar episodes, so no friends as of now,&gt;!self harm tendencies,!&lt; and quite a bit of debt to family (1000eur) after failed attempts at studying. I've never borrowed money for drugs.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't get proper help or treatment either as the queues to meet these professionals are insanely long in my country. We've got socialized healthcare so literally anyone can be put in the queue for free and of course people just go ahead.

I've yet to be diagnosed with BPD, C-PTSD, or ADHD but my psychologist, and a specialized psychologist, and a psychiatrist, have all went through the DSM-5 for all of those with me and is sure that I should be diagnosed ASAP as I'm struggling so much I can't even work or study (I've failed studies since middleschool due to ADHD, ASD, and BPD). BUT THE FUCKING QUEUES STOP ME FROM GETTING DIAGNOSED AND THEN THE PROPER TREATMENT. All of the disorders above are prominent in the male side of my family too. I should be able to even get specialized housing because of my ADHD and ASD and allowance from the government (about 80eur a week, I wouldn't have to pay rent) BUT I CANT BECAUSE OF THE QUEUES.

"So, Iâ€™ve (38M) been diagnosed with ADHD, bipolar 2, general anxiety, and dependent personality disorder. Iâ€™ve done therapy and meds (currently on two mood stabilizers and Adderall), but nothing helps.

Most of my problems revolve around work. Not my specific job, but just in general; Iâ€™m depressed when Iâ€™m unemployed because of the societal and familial pressure to work and look for a job, and the lack of money. Iâ€™m even more depressed when Iâ€™m employed because I just hate work so much. I feel like I have no say in my own life and am at somebody elseâ€™s whim. Also because I have to stop what Iâ€™m doing and go somewhere I donâ€™t want to go. Iâ€™m just in a constant state of dread. 

Anyway, maybe this just comes from the fact that I grew up well off and my parents never made me work in my formative years, so I just got used to it, so I didnâ€™t have the habit of working. Maybe Iâ€™m just a spoiled rich kid (not super rich, but upper middle class; dadâ€™s a dentist). Maybe this is what made me hate work and also made me so dependent. Iâ€™ve never, and still am not fully financially independent, and I have lived with my parents and been unemployed more often than not in my adult life (I live with my parents now, but am employed.). I just hate my life so much, and it all has to do with work. At least the majority of it. (Another problem is my inability to maintain, and at this point, even get, a romantic relationship. Iâ€™ve always been codependent in relationships. Again, comes from the dependent disorder.)

Maybe Iâ€™m just one of those lazy millennials the boomers always talk about. I mean, I have a job and am good at it; I work hard, but I hate it with every fiber of my being.  All I know is I canâ€™t keep living like this. I donâ€™t want this workaday life where I wake up, go to work, get off, fuck around until I get tired, remain isolated (working nights makes this worse) rinse repeat for the rest of my life. I CANT live forever like this, but am too mentally and physically exhausted to do anything about it. 


Basically, I just feel like if I didnâ€™t have to work but still had money I wouldnâ€™t be nearly as depressed, so itâ€™s not really mental illness; itâ€™s just laziness stemming from never having to work and having no responsibilities for so long while my brain was still developing. I donâ€™t know what to do. Rather, I have a good idea what to do, I just canâ€™t do it because Iâ€™ve been trained to be lazy. Sorry itâ€™s so long.

"I have been struggling with OCD and Schizophrenia since the start of last year (2021) when I got my first official diagnosis,before that I had  other delusions that resembled OCD for example I thought that I was the antichrist and had a marking on my forehead and that everyone but me could see it hence why they stared at me for long periods of time,obviously that wasn't the case but amazingly I somehow outgrew this delusion.

Come March 2021,The OCD came back in it's strongest form it came as a mix of both Harm and  Religious OCD,It led me to believe that I would cause the people evil eye or bad luck/injury if I felt jealous or looked at them without saying a certain prayer.This in turn led me to isolate in my house for six months fearing I might cause people harm if I went outside.

The reason this is causing so much problems is:

A)I would consider myself a good person but these thoughts make me think I am an evil person because if I was actually a good person I wouldn't have got these thoughts.

B)It has led me to ruminate about people in my head especially family members(e.g An evil thought comes in my head then I have to say the prayer and the process just repeats often accompanied with chest tightness,anxiety and feelings of distress).

C)I want to kill myself because it seems the only way the pain will go away and the thoughts will stop.

D)This delusion is self sustaining,what i mean by this is it is easy to debunk other delusions by logic but this delusion's effects seem real,for example people complaining about how their back or leg hurts or about any problems they may have triggers me to believe that I might have caused due to the Harm OCD.

However, I've been told I have Bipolar Disorder as well and Generalized Anxiety, and at previous places I had been officially diagnosed with those things(I believe). I just feel weird saying I have those two things if I'm not currently diagnosed at my current doctor, ya know? Do you guys think I should try to get documents from the previous places I've been to see what all my official diagnosis's are?  


I don't know if this is the appropriate place to post this, but I'm just like idk. Like I know what I struggle with and a lot of people say like you don't have to worry about official diagnosis's, however it's hard in today's climate to not have an official diagnosis on hand when people are fake claiming people left and right. It just worries me. Also it's validating to be officially diagnosed with something you struggle with and that you know you struggle with. Like I only recently have been diagnosed with ADHD and I feel a lot better now that I'm officially diagnosed. It makes me feel validated. I just don't want to go around telling people I have something I might not be officially diagnosed with.

I'm so sick of life. I've been having problems with both my mental and physical health and it's breaking me. It's been going on for almost three weeks and it's making me feel worse and worse and I've never wanted to give up more. Nothing feels worth fighting for. I have things to live for and I have huge dreams I wish to accomplish but I feel like I'll never be able to. I just want to give up. I don't want to fight anymore. I just want to die.

"Gonna keep it brief. I hate listing diagnoses and all that, it makes me feel like Iâ€™m discounting my abilities as a person, but it would probably help understand where Iâ€™m coming from. Got adhd, generalized anxiety, major depression and although Iâ€™m adopted, my birth father is schizophrenic and my birth mother is bipolar. They are both dysfunctional addicts.  

I believe in the past I have gone through more than one bout of psychosis, the worst after starving myself on amphetamines and losing 70 pounds in like three months. Eating still disordered, not as bad. Have told no one about the psychosis part, and this has been years now. 

Iâ€™ve slowly realized how different my thought process is than everyone else I interact with. Never really connected with someone on such a deep interpersonal level that I myself felt completely understood, but Iâ€™ve made amazing friendships with amazing people and I canâ€™t blame anyone for not getting me completely, they arenâ€™t me and I donâ€™t even understand myself most of the time. 

For example, I can be in a completely withdrawn, extremely scary mood where I just want to die and it seems like I just canâ€™t move on (Have quite literally looked down the barrel). Then I see a pizza on the counter and go, ooh, that looks good. Forgetting I just spent eight hours writhing around in my bed with physically painful thoughts. This is obviously not the only issue I have, but it helps paint a picture of how I go about my day. 

Is this just the nature of life? Distractions at every moment to keep the â€œdemonsâ€ at bay? Or do I really need clinical help? I feel like I should already know the answer,  but it truly confuses me. 

TL;DR 
Is going from seven hours of planning my death to â€œoh this pizza is fantasticâ€ at literally THE SNAP OF A FINGER, often, something I can really do anything about? Or am I doomed be it by the nature of life or genetically to be like this?",General_disorder

"I don't need answers I just need to vent.

Today has been a very shitty day, and I've been on the verge of breaking all day. My break down was starting and I was sobbing as per the usual. Then all of the sudden I hear the blinds in my kitchen (bedroom door leads to kitchen) tap against the window. No problem, sometimes that happens when my dad forgets to close the blinds and he wakes up and walks by and closes them. But then I hear something knock over. I heard chewing earlier so I assumed a mouse probably chewed all the way through and knocked something small over upon entrance, but here's the real kicker. All of the sudden I hear a pill bottle being shaken. Multiple times. At this point I'm horrified. My mom is at work, my dad is perssumed to be asleep as I heard him brush his teeth to which he does straight before going to bed and I have no pets or siblings. So I'm the only one who's 100% awake. 

I was thinking about it and explaining what happened while frantically texting my parents and then I realized that it could've been a hallucination with the amount of stress I've been in today. I was seeing a smokey haze both at school and at my house when I was thinking about the stress point and it's not the first time I've seen this during a low point and ever since I questioned if it was a hallucination the noises have stopped and honestly I'm just confused. 

My mom gets off of work in 5 minutes, and will be home soon. I haven't heard any noises in a good 30 minutes so I think I can hold on until then.

This happened like a year ago and I still havenâ€™t gotten any insight on it. At the time I was taking a low dose of seroquel at bedtime for my insomnia to help me sleep. One night I took it before bed as usual and went to sleep. The next thing I knew I was standing in my kitchen swallowing and choking on all of the seroquel from the bottle. Once I realized what I was doing I had throw up most of itâ€¦.I thought. I went back to sleep. Woke in in the morning so drowsy and out of it that I got ready for work and didnâ€™t even see all the pills and the mess I had made in the kitchen. I told my boss I wasnâ€™t feeling good and went home to see everything and suddenly remembered what happened. I donâ€™t take that medicine anymore.

"I have nobody to talk to so Iâ€™m posting this here. Iâ€™ve had a hard time since my childhoodâ€¦ I was beaten and constantly moved around. I was born with Pectus carinatum (pigeon chest), and itâ€™s always been a big insecurity of mine and gotten in the way of things. I blame it for being the root cause of most of my issues in life such as my awkwardness, self doubt, and inability to be quick/witty/funny. I donâ€™t really have a love for anything and feel like I was meant to just suffer until I die. No matter how many personality tests I take or how many things I try, I canâ€™t think of a career or anything I would enjoy. Because of this I still havenâ€™t gone to college. Iâ€™m approaching my mid 20s and feel like time is running out.

I hold two badass jobs, but  nobody really likes me at either of them. I can tell my boss has a general dislike of me, and would prefer to fire me but he canâ€™t because itâ€™s the military (reserves). Iâ€™m on temporary full time orders there currently, and keep fucking up by coming in late because I oversleep a lot. Had a stern talking to today and he made it a point that if it happens again heâ€™ll cut my orders and Iâ€™ll be a reservist for the rest of my enlistment. In other words, Iâ€™m blowing a great career option out of the window if it happens again. Most people there donâ€™t like me because I hardly know jack shit when it comes to how to do my job. Itâ€™s a somewhat complicated job. Even if you donâ€™t know jack shit, people there succeed off of self confidence which is impossible for me to have. My other job is a self owned business (sort of, not reallyâ€¦. I run it with my father). I have to play salesman. Iâ€™m ok at it but itâ€™s draining, especially when I get turned down. It isnâ€™t a career option either, just something weâ€™re going to sell eventually.

If I was liked, someone out of the shit ton of people I know would probably hit me up every once in a while, but it never happens. I would love to have a girlfriend, but Iâ€™ve never had one and that doesnâ€™t aid to the social skills it seems you need to get one. Im not unattractive, just the opposite of flirty, and prefer to stfu and sit in silence. My lifelong goal is a roof over my head and a wife I can come home to every day.

"Hello. I come to you asking for advice about a particular big problem I am having lately. I am diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, paranoid personality disorder and dependency disorder. Also I think I am showing signs of ADHD and bipolar disorder but I do not know for sure because I avoid therapy.

I am 20 of age, I have a girlfriend and I love drugs and life. I used anything that I could get my hands on but not in a mindless manner, only used for fun except weed, which I smoke daily for 2 years.

I am really struggling with my paranoia, I canâ€™t trust fully any person on this planet, not even my girlfriend or my family, itâ€™s like wired in my brain that everyone is out there to hurt me. In the past months I lost control over myself more and more, but mostly when I am with my girl. I canâ€™t control what I say half the times and rarely I canâ€™t control my reactions, I get angry extremely quickly out of dumb reasons, I am hurt by so small things she does that actually mean nothing, after feeling that she hurt me, I lose myself and I think at those times a manic episode starts. I do not hit her, I just talk shit and I am visibly agitated.

I am starting to let go of hope, I am starting to acknowledge that I am a crazy foul, an uncontrollable person that doesnâ€™t know what he wants. Thatâ€™s is because I am very undecided in everything, I say I love her then I donâ€™t feel any love, by the contrary I feel hate, then love comes back and this pattern happens in every aspect of my life, maybe because I might be bipolar too?

I do not want to let myself go down like that or lose this girl that understands me how I am and loves me like that, I want to stop hurting her and I keep trying but it seems I just canâ€™t control it. She told me today to go at a psychiatric to get treatment, meaning doping me with pills which I will love, because I was on some treatment about 2 years ago, I lost myself and started abusing the sleeping pills. Everything I do seems to be wrong, my life is so beautiful and I am living it to the fullest extent but I just cannot see it like that. I see everything like a living hell.

I also think that it means something special that an Illuminati member and I have the same birthday and that the symbol of the University of Helsinki related to Freemasonry etc. and my thoughts on studying there sometime in the future would be related in the way that I am supposed to become a Mason.

My other thoughts are that I get cyanide / poison gas / carbon monoxide poisoning and once even that my parents intentionally kill me for carbon monoxide poisoning. Anxiety about this has often grown so great that I have not been able to sleep or be at home. However, I realize that others do not experience things the same way or believe them to be true.

Throwaway account for anonymitys sake.

So tonight my brother in law (26M) had what i believe may have been a psychotic episode? Looking for some insight as i am not too knowledgeable in mental health, but would like to provide support if possible
. I was not there when this occurred so im going off what my S/O told me.

So my S/O and him were visiting and suddenly he got really paranoid and began freaking out and raising his voice about hearing voices all around him and he ran to the couch, grabbed a blanket to cover himself in and he started looking out the windows in a panick, he then took her phone and covered it in aluminum foil and was trying to stop her from leaving by blocking the door with his body while he was making weird movements with his tongue sticking out of his mouth. This went for around 10 minutes total. He then snapped completely out of it and didnt have any memory of any of it, or anything being abnormal.

He had smoked a half of a joint (legal canadian dispensary weed so nothing laced) but has a fairly high tolerance and it never effects him in that way.
He was also behaving slightly different all day apparently, nothing dramatic but a little distant/ removed if that makes sense.
Their father is diagnosed with schizophrenia, so that was my S/O's immediate concern.  But he hasn't displayed any  behaviours like this in the past.

Like i said, i know very little of schizophrenia or related mental health disorders. So i was hoping for some input or perhaps advice?

iâ€™ve had anxiety my whole life depression for most of my teens and adult years. i need to be clinically diagnosed but my symptoms line up perfectly with borderline personality disorder as well. since childhood i have lived with trauma and a fucked up family life that led to a warped reality and view of life relationships friendship etc. i can confidently say that people do not give a fuck about mentally ill people and all the shit they say it post about it doesnâ€™t translate to real life decisions. iâ€™ve been ostracized and treated as a weirdo or different my whole life all because iâ€™m different all over some shit i couldnâ€™t control and thatâ€™s in my genetic code. iâ€™m sick of living with this shit because everyone who supports the mentally is a fraud when it comes to doing that shit in day by day life all they give is weird looks and shit advice and all they want to do is leave you as soon as you open up to them because they know youâ€™re vulnerable and will blame yourself,General_disorder
"I'm a male in my mid 20s living in Ontario, Canada, working full time. I knew that my behavior was off and that there was something off, but I always thought that was because of my insecurities. I recently started watching some of Dr. Grande's YouTube videos about famous cases and dissecting the mental health of the people involved. The more that I dug in, the more I realized that I have some form of autism or at least anti social personality disorder combined with narcissistic disorder. 

I don't really have any friends. Just a few people from school that I see maybe a couple times a year. Sometimes weeks or even months will go by without us communicating. I have never really had a good relationship with my family, mostly because of my behavior and lack of empathy. I'm addicted to video games and the internet. I am working at the moment and I can sense that my coworkers pick up on my antisocial behavior and some choose to go out of their way to avoid me. I think this is something that might result in me losing this job and potentially ruin my career. I will be the first to be replaced as soon as they find someone better.

I'm in a very bad place mentally, all my behaviors and actions make sense now. I have always been told that I'm intelligent and that I have a bright future, but now I'm realizing that my life is going nowhere and me not doing something to fix my behavior/mental illness is the cause. I always had trouble communicating, but I always thought that was due to me being hyper. I'm realizing that my symptoms align exactly with what Dr Grande describes.

I really want to get better and live a normal life. The biggest reason I want to do this is to rekindle the relationship with my family. Sometimes I feel like I don't even know my parents that well because I never valued our relationship. I know that I need mental help, but I'm not sure where to start. Also, I'm really scared of the mental help sessions appearing on my background records somehow and ruining my chances at future employments. Regardless, I know that I cannot prolong this any further, any advice is appreciated.

"I've been on mirtazapine before, but I stopped all psychiatric medications besides stimulants and benzodiazepines because I found they had a lot less side effects and were way more effective than other medications, but I decided to ask my psychiatrist about things I can take everyday for anxiety, sleep, and agitation. Basically all the antipsychotics I've taken haven't been good, and I've tried almost all of them, so for mood my doctor mentioned lamotrigine or sodium valproate, but I was worried about weight gain on sodium valproate. I've been on mirtazapine before and found it moderately helpful for sleep, so I figured I'd try that instead of being awake for multiple days until I take a benzodiazepine. Has anyone had the combination? Or good experiences with lamotrigine? I'm mostly on it to be more calm, in terms of anxiety and having a very short fuse. Thanks for any input.",General_disorder
"Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s wrong with me, Iâ€™ll have a few days of just being depressed, cranky about things that donâ€™t matter, low energy and then suddenly I get a day of just being normal, not crazy happy or energetic (manic) just normal able to do day to day tasks and go to work/gym and do the work normally.

"i have adhd, autism, depression, and anxiety. my life, at this point in time, is a living nightmare. my adhd is mismanaged (currently on meds that donâ€™t do shit), my depression and anxiety are untreated, i am not yet in any sort of treatment/therapy to learn how to manage my autism. i struggle through every day of my life and itâ€™s a wonder how iâ€™m even able to get out of my bed in the morning. 

if living through this has taught me anything, itâ€™s that most people dont understand mental illness/disorders and the toll they take on a person. i donâ€™t sleep. i over eat. i either feel all my emotions at once or not at all. my grades at school are falling. my room has mold and insects because i canâ€™t clean it. i canâ€™t focus on anything. i skip school because i canâ€™t stand the thought of leaving my room. i donâ€™t do anything i enjoy anymore. iâ€™ve been wearing the same clothes for two weeks straight. i donâ€™t brush my teeth and hide my breath behind a face mask. my physical health is suffering. most days i want to dieâ€¦ the list goes on. 

and no one understands. i try to explain it, and they just donâ€™t get it. when i try to tell people thatâ€™s thereâ€™s just some things i canâ€™t do, they say things like, â€œbut itâ€™s not that hard,â€ and â€œi donâ€™t get why itâ€™s so difficult for you.â€ they think that because i am so â€œhappyâ€ all the time and i have a â€œbubbly personalityâ€ i automatically have to have a stable mental health. but i donâ€™t. iâ€™m just really good at hiding it because iâ€™ve found out no one cares, or they just donâ€™t know enough to care. even my *therapist* thinks i donâ€™t need antidepressants because iâ€™m always joyous when i see her. i cant bring myself to be anything but what people need me to be unless iâ€™m alone.

"Hi!

This is my first post here. I have depression and anxiety and was first diagnosed back in January of 2016. Before being diagnosed I was doing research about my overwhelming feelings of anger at work (at this time I was working in retail) and talking to a friend who had depression in the past and what she thought of how I was feeling. My friend said she didn't think I was depressed since my main and only symptom was anger and only while at work. Google searches only mentioned bipolar disorder and I knew I didn't have that. It wasn't until I self-harmed for the first time to release my pent up anger from work that my friend suggested I may actually be depressed. I soon after went to my PCP, you referred me to a therapist, who diagnosed me with depression and anxiety.

So, to make a long explanation short, I wish there were more articles/information about anger being a possible sign of depression and not just bipolar disorder. What about you all? What do you wish there was more information for?",General_disorder
"All I can think are suicidal thoughts right now. I just feel this fucking awful sense of dread and anguish in the pit of my stomach. I canâ€™t do any of things I need to do and I have no support. I only feel this or numbness, nothing else. Nothing seems to help and I donâ€™t know what to do.

Iâ€™m supposed to be finding a way to move out of my toxic environment but I canâ€™t. I got into a fight with the social worker I got referred to, I try and find work I can do from home and as soon as I start the application process I just shut down. I canâ€™t function and when I even think about being productive my cognition shuts down and all I can think about is how something is seriously wrong with me and thereâ€™s no way out. I donâ€™t want to keep living like this and the only way I can think to get out of it is to die.

Nothing seems to help, none of the treatments Iâ€™ve done have done anything. I canâ€™t even remember how many meds Iâ€™ve tried and years of therapy have amounted to nothing at all. But even though I know none of the treatments help, all I can think to do is get myself institutionalised. One hour of therapy every month is not enough or something I guess. I just feel like I need something more constant, for someone to actually sit down and figure out how to genuinely help me, not just take me in for an hour and throw me back out before I feel like weâ€™ve gotten anywhere at all.

But I canâ€™t go. I canâ€™t handle the drama that would come with all of that and Iâ€™d almost certainly get kicked out of home if I went. I have nowhere else to stay, so itâ€™d leave me homeless once I was out. I just donâ€™t know what to do.",General_disorder

"This is going to be a long one, sorry in advance!

The list of mental health diagnosis goes on and onâ€¦ C-PTSD, anorexia, depression, anxiety etc.. but boy am I grateful in a strange way that all those struggles wound me up in therapy.

It was a long road of treatment centers and psychiatric hospital stays and continuous therapy in my youth going into my 20â€™s. My parents didnâ€™t know what to do with me besides send me away, and although I was resentful for a long time at both how they handled it and I was angry at my brain for being this way, I almost wouldnâ€™t of had it any other way.
Not only did I learn coping skills to deal with self destructive behaviors and how to keep myself alive, but I learned a larger sense of empathy, kindness, how to communicate effectively, setting boundaries, learning to love parts of myself I never thought I could, I just simply became such a better person than I ever could have imagined for myself. I didnâ€™t even consider these changes that I needed, but I am so grateful.
I used to be a resentful, jealous, and toxic person. 
The kind of person who would make rude comments online to feel better about myself, Iâ€™d be inconsiderate and passive aggressive when I didnâ€™t get my way, I was sort of manipulative at times and overall was not a good friend or even person.
But through therapy, meeting people from all walks of life and hearing their stories, and learning about myself and why I did the things I did, boy did I make such necessary and worthwhile changes.

I would never think of leaving a rude comment on social media, I love to spread positivity and kindness and always look to brighten someoneâ€™s day. I set boundaries, respect myself and others, I encourage achievement in people instead of being jealous of those doing what I used to perceive as â€œbetterâ€ than me. 

There is a burden of hate and resentment lifted from my shoulders. Yes, mental illness destroyed my life and probably played a big part in who I used to be, but growing and accepting myself opened a pathway to becoming someone Iâ€™m proud of. Iâ€™m now someone I consider to be so kind, caring, positive and just overall a good person. Iâ€™m so proud of who Iâ€™ve become and canâ€™t wait to see how much more Iâ€™ll grow. 
Therapy didnâ€™t just save my life but created a new one that Iâ€™m proud of. It works if you put in the work, I still struggle with mental illness and might always will, but I am able to cope in positive ways and constantly look to better myself. Iâ€™m so happy I went to therapy and put in the work to save myself. I am much better for it.",General_disorder
" So I've been diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, general anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, unipolar, since i was young. I was on 80 mg of Geodon, an antipsychotic, until I was 18 when I made progress in behavioral therapy bit after eventually being off all meds for a year, took a lot of work to get to that point, I started being on just SSRIs and it helps but I noticed that my depressive episodes can be pretty volatile. There have been multiple times I go from,being ok to having a lot of suicidal ideation and not being able to get out of,bed within a week and one time I went from sad but ok while in class, when my ex and I,we're having a nasty breakup, but within an hour was in that depressed state where I felt,nihilistic to my core and started typing up a suicide note while,on the way up to a parking garage top floor which was really sudden, keep in mind I made a vow against suicide and it kept me alive until adulthood. 

I also seem to have some mania occasionally? Spent 2 weeks getting a maximum of four to six, often two, hours of sleep a night in October and was super energetic and felt powerful and on top of the world, started talking to and planning on meeting and havjng sex with 4 people at the time ans was more bold and impulsive then when I didn't feel that way, kinda felt weird about it. Mt boss was joking,about drug testing me because I was literally acting like someone who smokes meth. Also spent a week a bit over three and a half years ago suddenly really manic and didn't enter REM cycle for a week and had withdrawal feelings when i crashed. Started feeling that way minorly this week when I only slept 8 hours over 3 days and just... Wanted to type up a hobby novel instead of sleeping but took olanzapine and a Xanax and slept 7 hours so I'm,back to normal. Was also super gabby and feeling,confident and a bit elated before.

 Is this normal? Or should I talk to my therapist and shrink? I never did because once I'm out of it, it no longer matters to me and I don't like talking about it in detail but this is raising questions and I'm confused since knowing,my brain chemistry and emotional patterns is important for me to know how to adapt to them. I'm also much more,calm and centered on antipsychotics, a very noticeable difference.

Continuing off of my uncle, if I get angry at a game, he fucking starts screaming at me with his stank breath self and fucking forces me to get off, and if I bring up his yelling at night (100x worse mind you) he goes ape shit and starts acting like he's not a failure. Starts acting as if he owns my house, but in reality, he gets 1. NO HOES (I'm an 8th grader and talk to way more girls than him) 2. CAN'T GET A JOB, BUT YELLS AT MY BROTHER FOR IT 3. IS FUCKING 30. THIR-TY AND LIVES WITH HIS SISTER. See, my dad works in another country (my parents aren't divorced) but the second my dad comes to visit, he doesn't dare yell at my siblings or I, doesn't dare disrespect us, always acts like he's a second father figure, but the second my dad goes back, he's a total fucking bitch. Onto my mom again, this bitch is literally fucking STUPID and expects me and my siblings to be legit demigods on the mental end. Gave my sister an eating disorder by calling her fat, and then calling her too skinny, insults anyone on their interests or literally anything. Like, she is legitimately stupid.

"to start, i have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ocd (only mentioning because maybe they have something to do with why im struggling). 

i started high school this year and i thought that i would be doing better than i was in online school, im not. i can hardly be in school without having a panic attack, dissociating or getting physically sick. i get so stressed that i get fevers and sometimes vomit. i really hate being around so many people and being trapped here for the majority of my day (and week). i had this problem before quarantine as well but not to this degree. i just keep getting more and more stressed out and itâ€™s affecting my grades which is out of character because iâ€™ve always gotten good scores. 

i really feel quite hopeless and it feels like nobody cares, my mom just says its because i dont take my meds (i take zoloft, i react badly to it so iâ€™ve been weening off it) and my dad just says i need to get the â€œhigh school experienceâ€. 


i would greatly appreciate advice or coping mechanisms because i cant miss any more school this year and my dad doesnt want me to do online / home school because he thinks i wont get into a good college.",General_disorder
"I am not sure how well the title represents my situation but it sound good and catchy so ye.

I have a strong samskara about not being productive, not sticking with something, basically about not being a pitta (or kapha even) and I've been trying to fight, understand it, heal it, whatever for like 2 years already and I've been getting better at listening to my feelings and understanding when I should push myself, when I should let myself explore, at knowing when my thoughts are usefull or when they aren't, and yet I am hitting new lows on my mental health, I am getting scared that I am think that I don't want to live anymore more everyday. I am even starting to lose the energy to help myself. Everytime I think ""oh i done this wrong i could do this better"" or ""maybe trying to do exercise or meditate"" my mind just rejects those thoughts. Also the fact that I cannot cry or release my emotions in any way shape or form other than being angry and hitting shit does not help one fucking bit. I am aware of how much of an angry asshole I came as to the people around me but I can't fucking help being anything but pissed and angry. i literally cannot feel sad or hurt.

I am starting to think that the only thing that would get me out of this is some luck from the outside world, maybe my parents kick me out and having to sustain myself will keep me going, maybe taking some adhd medication wil magically make me functioning (I can barely play video games or watch anime, let alone try to get over the resistance that I feel everytime I want to do a creative pursuit), or maybe starting my transition and going on hormonal therapy will have some magical effects on my well being and give me some ""life energy"" to do something.

Taking care of my body, not eating so unhealthy (i just snack a lot), exercising, going to a therapist don't help at all and at this point I doubt I have it in me to do these long enough to see something out of them, I am completely unable to stick to anything for more than a week, and I mean anything. I am so fucking tired of helping myself and seeing nothing other than extremely minimal progress and improvment.

I kinda get that I have to let go of trying to be productive and sticking to shit and focus on having fun and stuff, but I just don't know what to do anymore. Being addicted to dopaminergic shit does not help and having 0 empathy from my family that I live with does not help too. I am basically stuck in my room (better than being next to them tbh). Going out also is not very fun, unless I have money I got fuck all to do in the outside world. Maybe finding some friends that go out would help but like I said before, no energy to do that.

 I struggle to hold a conversation with anyone, and I always leave interactions feeling very awkward, and thinking I made the other person uncomfortable (which I probably did).

I canâ€™t think things through, or fast enough in a conversation. I always get jealous of others when I notice how fluently they can respond to others, and make the conversation comfortable.

I thought that once schools ended my mental health would improve but it just hasn't. I haven't had a panic attack since then but my mental state has just deteriorated in other ways.

Now its not all bad, over the past 2 months I can pinpoint moments where I have been genuinely happy, but it seems as though the bad moments are much more memorable and lasting than the goods ones. 

I have already decided that I'm not going to throw in the towel, but sometimes it just seems like a good idea.

But every single time I reach the deadline the goal moves farther away and it makes me wonder if I'm ever gonna reach a point in my life where I am truelly happy and not  plagued with constant debilitating stress.

"//TW: &gt;!Obsessive behavior, dark thoughts, Id-consuming fantasies, intrusive thoughts, repression, rape/molestation, potential delusions, ramblings of a seemingly sane and externally normal person getting anxious about little things that all share one common thing obsessively and fearfully!&lt;

//Additional flair - Advice Needed, Venting, Discussion

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why, but for the last few months for about since December of 2020, I've been having these increasingly worrying obsessive thoughts, behaviors, dreams, and minor reality-confusing delusions involving these dreams about this former crush of mine. I for my life have been fairly emotionally and mentally struggling, but I manage fairly well in my opinion with what I have been diagnosed with as Asperger's, Anxiety, Social Anxiety, and Depression. My mother has a history of Schizophrenia, delusions, hallucinations, and drug abuse (which may or may not have occurred concurrently with when I was in the womb?) and my father is a recovered alcoholic who may or may not be far on the spectrum, albeit not diagnosed (though extremely asocial.)

My friends all consider me extremely polite and introverted, as well as passionate about my hobbies and naive/inoffensive. I try to be humble and don't even try to accept compliments or nice words because of self-doubt potentially stemming from my neglectful childhood, but I am also open to self-criticism and understanding of acknowledgments over my behavior. I am partly religious, and I have a great moral code I hold myself to even though there'd be no punishments supposedly if I broke it (I am very sentimental, and everything I've done I feel bad for, including worrying about and fearing minor faux-pas as major relationship-breaking insecurities, mainly including this as my stemming issue.) I am also extremely in my own head, and overthink absolutely everything in going the extra mile, sometimes losing focus and disassociating on what's real to me just to think about things at places like work, in bed, at home, in college, and everywhere else. I believe being stuck in my own head is what may partly be involved in these things. I am extremely forgetful of simple things due to my obsessive nature (though I find work fun and fortunately obsess about the things I like doing that I need to do) as well Asperger's playing into my lack of understanding of social cues, which I believe plays a big part in my differentiation my view of the real world.

Now, I have had a perfectly stable relationship with a partner of mine since that December, and part of me has been feeling a sinking feeling of regret subconsciously despite the fact that I am extremely happy with my decision of my partner, and I plan on staying dedicated. The person I'm having these troubling thoughts and visions of mostly includes &gt;!repressed sexual fantasies, confused emotions, and dreams of me following or stalking them.!&lt; Before all this, however, it was a much more subtle draw - I was still going to school to finish my high-school education, and I would make visits to the school under the guise that I was there to see my sister, but I actually went to see them and make very minor interactions despite the 1-2 mile walk I would take hours before work since I didn't have a car (I moved out now, and am far away, but the dreams and minor confusions/delusions between them and reality still linger and are getting worse.) I eventually learned where they lived since they walked to and from school about a few minutes away, and tried to learn their schedule to leave gifts for them at the doorstep. One day, however, I was found and came up with the reason that I was late for work and was afraid to ask for a ride since I didn't think I would make it in time just by walking. Fortunately, it all worked out, and I actually occasionally got rides on the days I got to see them, but I felt like I was becoming better friends with her mother since we talked together more than with her sometimes. 

I am very active in the LGBTQ community and learned that she is potentially aromantic and asexual, which kinda subconsciously freaked me out even though I realize that I just had too much free time to even do these things (Not anymore!) I soon realized that I think my obsession began stemming from gender envy, as I am AMAB and believe that I should transition into a woman because I am more emotional and vocal than average men, and I do not feel comfortable compared to other men. I am a blonde and she is a ginger, and we both wear glasses, so I think subconsciously I've seen a lot of myself in her comparatively for gender goals, but haven't started my transition yet.

As for these dreams, they've ranged anywhere from her being stuck in out-of-place with my real friend group since I'd say we were friend-related acquaintances that saw each other but never really interacted much - then slowly began going into other dreams with her as a focus, such as one where I was at what I imagined was her house (A mansion in a rainforest jungle) where her and my girlfriend both helped me in my visit dressed as maids, and by the end, I had to pick - Another one where I was at where I thought to be her house (In a suburb surrounded by a fairy fantasy forest where I got attacked by a bear) and I was stalking her house (a recurring theme) and I use things like drones or climbing up to window-view in nearby trees - To the more concerning dreams, such as one where she molested me in a doctor's waiting room, and everyone else felt too awkward to help me - To one where I stalked her but got cursed and began obsessively blacking out and killing innocent people and people I loved without control for her, where there was nobody real left except for me and her as she revealed herself to be a demonic eldritch horror that cursed me to fall for her - To several sexual encounters I myself had intrusive thoughts of just in general. 

I do NOT consent to any of this in my mind. I find no feelings of proudness or gratification for any of these subconscious thoughts through my Superego, I simply blame my overactive Id for eating up my Ego and consciousness with these thoughts.

The worst part? These all feel real. I can hear their voices like I was there in person and remember conversations, I can remember the looks they give me and where we were down to ineptifying detail, and I hear all these conversations about things as if she and I were living our own life in my head that I peep into at night, like a messed up version of the world I think of obsessively developing constantly in every waking moment I think about these things, just ready to release themselves the second I fall asleep. Some nights I anticipate it, and some nights I fear it. But the same thing always happens when I wake up - I begin telling myself that everything that happened there is part of who this person really is. I know this isn't true, but when I try to remind myself of who this person is, I often jump to a fake memory before a real one, and it scares me.

Let me know what you think, though! The way I see it, this poor person is simply the random figment my brain decided to delude over considering something like this may have likely always been determined to happen to something no matter who or what it would have been, but I want to make myself clear - I do NOT feel proud for any of this, and I want this to stop. I am aware that giving any of these feelings attention is more likely to make them worse, but since this is subconsciously still happening even after I forget about it, I simply wanted to get my voice heard so one day I can find a positive association with any of this, and transition and find happiness with myself and unconscious envy so I can move on from what I think this is all about. That is all.

Thank you for hearing me out, it is an honor to have people on this website who care for hearing the feelings of other people. I believe it is a skill I wish everyone possessed, and I will do my best to make my life and my world better as long as you all promise to do the same.",General_disorder

"I'm 18, I have a lot of hyperfixations, I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression and Anxiety. I love talking about the things I'm interested in and I could definitely talk and talk and talk about anything but no one wants to listen.

I have two friends, I stayed friends with them when we finished high school but god, they are really boring. I hate to feel this way but they are truly terrible at being friends, I'm usually expected to sit there and listen to what they have to say and they never listen back.

One of them, our conversations revolve entirely around her dating life, Id love to be a friend you can vent to about your struggles in dating but there's only so many times you can have someone ask you ""What do you think he means?"", ""should I keep talking to him?"", "" do you think he likes me?""(about the same guy btw) before I realize, oh my god! I really do not care about your dating life!!!!!

They don't respect any of my interests, but I have what they would consider ""childish"" interests. They often make fun of me for my hyperfixation towards toys. I collect toys like crazy. I also wear lolita fashion and non traditional clothing and they make fun of me for it. It sends my self esteem crashing down.

I've tried making new friends but its so hard, I also tried making friends online but its even worse! No one is interested in anything I have to say and in general men are the most interested in speaking to me, not because they find me interesting but because they're looking for something else, I have a boyfriend.

This isolation has led me to form an unhealthy emotional attachment to my boyfriend, he loves the way I dress and he himself does not collect toys like I do but he is very supportive of it but he has a life of his own, he has his own hobbies and I can't have his attention 100% but I am really attached to him and I constantly need to talk to him. I've never felt kindness and respect this way before. Sometimes though, I feel doubt, I feel like he isn't listening, I feel like when I am talking, no one is listening.

I feel alone, I have no one to bond over uncommon interests with, I do with him but I fear this attachment and my boredom, my constant need for stimulation and constant need to talk might not only ruin our relationship but my social life in general too.

"I wish to know if there's a name for this: I get really nauseous and like my body petrified and gets a big unnerving feeling all over my body if I witness someone in front of my eyes being extremely hurt via wounds. For eg I watched one of the people at my school split his head open and i watched the blood pour from his head and I nearly vomited. Then I watched a live leak of a French guy on the floor after being stabbed and these dudes were just poking and slashing his face whilst he was just screaming in pure pain. And it made me feel really distorted from life and nauseous.

Im only able to write and describe this bc I'm high as balls, I can't lie.

Now, they told me from the begining that they aren't experienced with ADHD and trauma but i really wanted a regular therapy so they said they would do reading on these topics. But now i question if they are able to help me if they ask me if i was dreaming an intrusive thought. Am i overthinking this?
Also the therapist questioned my (light form of) ADHD diagnosis as first because I would not seem to have it. (I guess because I can sit in a chair still) but I am a women. Everyone with ADHD knows how Different it is in females. I assured them the diagnosis was professionally done and gave it to them. And i gave them all the notes on me resumes from teachers in primary school which all said, she can't Focus, wants to help others instead of doing her assignments, difficulties getting along with peers, makes an impressive contribution to biology/general classes. Even a professional IQ test i took in my teenage years which also said the differences in performance could be a concentration issue and it should be looked after (that never happend, though).
Besides that everything about me seems to make sense after my ADHD diagnosis 2 years ago. So i guess what I'm trying to say is, it is really hard to find a good therapist and i don't know if they are experienced enough to help me. And i am unsure if this constant reexplaining to a therapist is a good sign. I rellay hope someone reads this :D sorry for spelling and everything,  english isn't my native tongue",General_disorder

"Ok so Iâ€™m not sure what to even do or say but Iâ€™m going to sum it up as best as I can. I feel like I might have NPD and I want to know from others if I should actually go get help or even just diagnosed.

My father passed away when I was in kindergarten so this was a very crucial loss to my development. I grew up hating the world for taking away something everyone else had. I felt unlucky, I never actually cried when he died, only when I started to realize that â€œdamn Iâ€™m missing someone who everyone else hasâ€ I started to cry about it. I grew up in a house full of women, I have 5 sisters, my mom and they all put me on a pedestal since I was the only male. They all made me feel special like I was the golden child. I was very babied. This made me have a massive ego from kindergarten all the way to 6th grade. When I got to 6th grade I realized something isnâ€™t right. Everyone else is growing and Iâ€™m still a baby I donâ€™t have any type of hair on my face and Iâ€™m still weak and child like, very very undeveloped. The reason being is I actually had an underlying condition called GHD (growth hormone deficiency) which mean my brain doesnâ€™t make enough â€œpowerâ€ to evolve me into a teenager and then a man. Not only did I have this but I had bad vision so I had glasses and I had really messed up teeth (very bad). So then that ego that I had started to burn rapidly and I started feeling weaker than ever, I did not like watching other kids grow taller because I felt inferior and small. I was stuck in a childâ€™s body. So everyone teased and laughed at me which then made me feel VERY VERY insecure to the point where I was trying to become someone else. I would brush out and damage my curly hair because everyone else had straight hair. I started changing the way I dressed and became very materialistic. And then I donâ€™t remember what else happened until 7th grade when I became the standard overt narcissist. I was very fucking obnoxiously cocky to the point where Iâ€™d get a rush outta people telling me I was cocky and annoying, I loved running my mouth. I would fight and hit others when losing (like a total meltdown) when others would shame me Iâ€™d yell and become infuriated. Ive abused my family members so many times. One time my little sister moved my charger where I was charging my tablet so I yelled at her and choked her, when I slept in HER room because I was too scared to sleep in mine for a few years, one time she spilled water on her PILLOW so I got mad and pounded her head into the pillow. One time I was too afraid to use the restroom so I grabbed a toy she had and threw it at her face for not being awake to accompany me to the restroom. I would love looking at myself in the mirror, I would love to show off my six pack and hair. I had a workout routine. I dropped soccer because I felt â€œtoo goodâ€ at it. I picked up basketball not because I liked it but because I wanted to show people I was better than them. Iâ€™d love getting reactions out of people. Iâ€™d belittle everyone even my own family, feeling no remorse. I was a horrible person at that time. Now that I look back I can admit I was very fucking insecure. If i didnâ€™t feel attractive Iâ€™d restart my entire look that day. If I didnâ€™t feel good enough Iâ€™d go into the bathroom at 3 in the morning and do my hair and get ready just so I could sleep feeling attractive. I would go to the bathroom during the cafeteria and look at myself in the mirror and find things I could fix. At this time everyone thought I was rich due to my mom driving a Benz (from money she got back from dads death case) and also because she owned a small local restaurant. I was very materialistic and had meltdowns when I didnâ€™t get what I wanted. Iâ€™d wear ONLY mainstream brand clothing. I was into that â€œhype beastâ€ shit. I felt better in every way than everyone even god himself. Iâ€™d call myself a god. I had a lot of friends and was pretty popular. This â€œovertâ€ phase lasted for 6 years before I met my cousins friend who wants to become a psychologist. She tricked me into opening up one night idek how. I guess I just love talking about myself that much. And she basically got me to look into NPD, and of course Iâ€™m going to soul search it because Iâ€™m just very obsessed with myself. Iâ€™d like to say she made me self aware because I hate being self aware and I donâ€™t want to take accountability of such an L, but in reality I made myself aware. I fit all the criteria for NPD. Now that Iâ€™m self aware Iâ€™m very confused. I feel like a mix of covert and overt but i donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s possible. I feel like a shy overt. Im an extrovert but Iâ€™m shy at the same time I love talking to people. Now that im aware I feel very insecure but still better than everyone else. I feel like god but at the same time inferior. Iâ€™m very envious and obsessive. I become obsessed and hateful to others that I feel believe they are better than me or I feel that they are better than me. I stalk peoples pages and lives. I hate to see others win. I feel weaker than ever. I really do victimize myself by saying the things that have happened to me. I donâ€™t feel like either overt or covert I feel like both. But sometimes I donâ€™t recognize myself or the person in the mirror. Feels almost as if thatâ€™s not me and thatâ€™s just the idea or persona i play. Nowadays people think Iâ€™m kind and humble but nobody knows Iâ€™m the devil himself a truly horrible person who doesnâ€™t even care about others and definitely doesnâ€™t change his behavior. I know Iâ€™m a bad person but i donâ€™t do anything about it because I feel little guilt or remorse. I have very crazy dreams like becoming a popular and famous YouTuber, my literal plans are to take over the fucking world, I want to do nice things and get a great legacy. I will step on anyone who gets in my way and will destroy anyone who wrongs me. A few months ago I tried getting GF because I wanted to see if I could truly Love someone and I thought I did for a while. I went through the obsessive love bombing but then she ghosted me because I was too fast and now I see thatâ€™s why every girl leaves me before dating. But when she ghosted me I didnâ€™t cry or anything I simply did not care almost like I had fake feelings for her. I really donâ€™t care about love or romance when it comes to my goals or dreams. Iâ€™d kill myself if I couldnâ€™t live a life with goals or dreams. All I want it to be satisfied, that to me is the greatest feeling that I will probably never feel. I always want more and better. I canâ€™t be with someone who has low status. Thereâ€™s a lot of things Iâ€™m missing out but Iâ€™d just like to know your advice. Is it possible that I might have NPD, should I go get help???",General_disorder
"I (20m) recently ( 4 months ish) met a girl (23f)  Iâ€™m really romantically interested in , the only problem is I have never felt like any sort of feelings towards someone like this , I have never cared for the feelings of a person I have been involved with or how I make them feel. With her itâ€™s different , Iâ€™m learning to process all these emotions so late, like jealousy etc that I havenâ€™t had to deal with and I find myself being rude and taking it out on her and bringing up things from the past that hurt me. Weâ€™re amazing when weâ€™re sober but when I drink thatâ€™s when it starts to come out , and I donâ€™t know how to process it all because I want to do better and be better for her but I feel like Iâ€™m just broken , I also have a lot going on at the moment but Iâ€™m not trying to make excuses, I just want to improve.  itâ€™s obvious drinking plays a part but I feel like at our age I will be ostracised socially if I stop drinking as most of my friends are still go clubbing and drinking and she enjoys that too.",General_disorder

She just recently bought sleeping pills while i think it might help her i still think she should better visit a doctor but she refuses to see one (not because of prices healthcare here is covering all the costs), i think it's because of that hopelessness that she just can't bring herself to do anything.

"Itâ€™s something that Iâ€™ve always felt on some level, that Iâ€™m just missing some key piece of my brain that other people seem to have. I just canâ€™t seem to feel any emotions in the ballpark of feeling connected to or comforted by other people. Iâ€™ve tried to explain it to a previous therapist before and it led to her exploring the possibility that I might be on the autistic spectrum but she ultimately decided I wasnâ€™t after digging deeper. Itâ€™s hard for me to fully explain I guess, but itâ€™s like thereâ€™s some part of my brain that is supposed to feel positive things when Iâ€™m shown validation or empathy or understanding or something like that, and it just isnâ€™t there. 

Normally I donâ€™t really care, or at least Iâ€™ve learned to live with it. Itâ€™s kinda like being ravenously hungry but no matter how much you eat you donâ€™t feel any fuller, you just get to a point where you have to accept it for what it because seemingly nothing can be done. So I have to accept that loneliness is something I canâ€™t avoid, and that actually being around people makes me feel *more* alone. And it actually makes things a lot easier in some respects because it means that letting people in can only be a bad thing for me. I canâ€™t experience the positive emotions people feel from interpersonal relationships no matter how much I might want to, so all I can actually experience is the bullshit people bring which means itâ€™s never worth it and I can at least take solace in the fact that I never have a reason to let anyone in again.

But I guess where it becomes sorta more distressing is when I start thinking about trying to make progress in therapy or heal in some way from my childhood trauma. I can live without people and have for a long time now, but I canâ€™t live without the ability to hold down jobs because me mental state is too unstable to allow me to work for very long without mentally crippling myself. So there are things I need to improve in order to keep living. One of the things I hear over and over again about therapy is that you need to feel safe and comfortable with a therapist in order to get anywhere, so what is someone like me supposed to do? People canâ€™t physically illicit feelings of safety or comfort in me, whatever part of my brain thatâ€™s supposed to allow for that is seemingly gone.

"Iâ€™m a second year trans male in college, always been introverted, have a close knit group of friends. Two of those friend (letâ€™s call them A and B), including the one who has been my roommate for the past two years, are going to New Zealand for spring semester in our third year. 
Due to being transgender and having a long past of not being accepted and experiencing emotional abuse around this, Iâ€™m extra wary about my living situation. A and B want to get an apartment with another friend, C, and myself. I know I can trust all of them, but A and B havenâ€™t found anyone to take their place for spring semester.
I canâ€™t handle more potential emotional (and potentially even worse) abuse from strangers who the university sticks in their place. 
Thus, Iâ€™ve been heavily considering telling them that Iâ€™m going to get a single room instead. When mentioned to C, they told me that I shouldnâ€™t drop stuff like that on them, that they donâ€™t have a backup plan, and had a panic attack, which they didnâ€™t say was my fault but heavily implied that they believe it to be so.
I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.

"My relative is in a hospital for several days now, after going on a very bad downward spiral for the past 3 months. I'm glad he's in a hospital getting treatment for his mental illness (was diagnosed bipolar a while back but now also have schizophrenic behavior too).

He continues to deny that he needs help, even while in the mental hospital. He lies and denies all sorts of things.

He's an adult so nobody can make him go into a long term rehabilitation program, though we all know he needs it.
He's got no money, not able to work or take care of himself, likely has tons of debt, can't pay rent and will be evicted from his home soon.

"So for the last 7 years or so I've been experiencing these extremely disorienting episodes, possibly psychosis, I can't tell. They usually happen about every 1-2 months, with each event causing me to be very susceptible to another within a short timeframe. The episodes go as follows:

\- I'll be doing something, usually something menial/thoughtless like brushing my teeth while I'm thinking, but not always. 

\- Suddenly, out of nowhere, I'm rushed into an extremely vivid scene or set of scenes that never happened, with entire context, preceding events, locations, people, situations/problems/tasks at hand, everything. It's as if my mind suddenly crossed paths with an alternate reality. Sometimes these are repeat scenarios, sometimes new ones (new ones are by far the most disorienting). Everything happens in rapid succession while my vision of the real world goes dark. I typically know these are not real but it all feels extremely familiar despite never happening. When there's a new scenario, I don't notice they're not real until about 20-30 seconds in, which causes it to be far more disorienting. As this happens, I get extremely dizzy and nauseous, typically throwing up, and my head hurts badly. Usually this lasts between 2-5 minutes. 

\- After the sudden rush, I will be in a complete dissociated daze. It's as if these two timelines - the real one and the fake one I just encountered - are poured into a pool, with no axis of time nor distinction between the two. I can't think, my often loud mind goes pretty quiet. This typically lasts between 1-2 hours, fading away slowly, with much of it gone by 30-45 minutes. That said, I'm pretty out of it for the rest of the day. It's during that succeeding two hours that it is very easy to have another one, and I've had 5 or 6 in a row multiple times. As mentioned, repeat events are even more disorienting, with as few as 2 putting me completely out of commission for the rest of the day. 

I've always thought I was having some sort of psychosis-related false flashback, as it feels similar to deja vu. However, with my last one being a often repeated scenario, I was able to hold on just hard enough to observe it more closely. I think it might actually be a dream. The new yet familiar scenarios, the rapid succession relative to real-time, the immersiveness, the disorientation, everything, points to my mind having a dream despite being fully awake and doing stuff during the day. The thing is, why would this take place? I'm not amazingly sleep deprived, and it has happened consistently for nearly a decade. Does anyone have any idea what's going on? Any help would be massively appreciated.",General_disorder

"Iâ€™m starting to be very concerned for my mental health as I regularly fail to recognise people I havenâ€™t seen in years. It sometimes happens to meet people I apparently used to hangout with in primary school (Iâ€™m now turning 19). I sometimes recognise them by name, but I cannot possibly find any visual resemblance. 


I remember the way they looked the last time I saw them, but itâ€™s like theyâ€™re a complete different person now, Iâ€™m just completely unable to recognise them. I live in a small town, so I meet people I know almost every day, but I very often greet people back who I have no fucking clue who they are. 


As long as we just greet each other itâ€™s all good, but if they wanna start a conversation it suddenly gets extremely cringy and awkward as I try my best to act like I know them. The worst is if they talk about some past event we took part in together, which I obviously donâ€™t remember. 


I sometimes recognise them if I know them by name, but it takes me some good minutes for my brain to be able to put their past and current facial features together and see them as the same person. I also seem to forget family members I havenâ€™t seen in 3-4 years, itâ€™s the same issue as I know them by name but I forget how they look.


Even if some of them havenâ€™t aged and look almost the same, I wonâ€™t recognise them if I see their face unless they tell me who they are and then everything clicks in. Itâ€™s sooo weird. The main reason I post this is because today I had a 15 minutes conversation with a middle aged man I met at a gas station who seemed to know me and my family very well. 


He asked me how Iâ€™m doing, if I graduated, if I have a job, how are my parents (knew their names) and he even knew the things our family struggled with because he asked me if weâ€™re doing ok with x and y. I talked to him like I knew him, but I swear to god I never saw this man before in my life. I have absolutely zero idea who he was. From my point of view, thereâ€™s the first time I met him.

"Hello, hope everyone's doing ok. Sorry, it's me moaning again. Not sure what I'm trying to say but

Everything is just too hard. I can't seem to ""fight"" anymore, I just don't have the energy to try anymore and I fail every time anyway. I'm such a leech and a waste of life, all I ever do is make life difficult for others and I don't even have the decency to get better for their sake. 

I have no redeeming qualities or talents through which I could even begin to try to repay my family for putting up with me, and I don't seem to get any enjoyment or relief from anything; even (sorry I'm being disgusting) masturbation feels like nothing anymore. Don't even have the energy to self-harm; the way I see it, it won't help, nothing does, and if people find out they'll be angry so not worth it. Not that I deserve pleasure or relief, but I wonder if the lack thereof makes it even harder to see what the point is, which shows how selfish and worthless I am.

Nothing seems to help anymore. I'm on three medications and have been on several more and we've tried stuff like CBT, group therapy, EMDR and I'm currently doing art psychotherapy. I've even been hospitalised and I guess the OCD kind of receded a bit but I can't remember what we did in therapy or whatever, and it came back full force after a while. It really seems that I am just supposed to continue to get worse until I either eventually snap and end myself (which I imagine would just ruin people's lives more than I already do) or just exist, trying to control the damage I cause as much as possible, until my family have passed and then die then. There's just no hope left, no spark.

"Is it ok if I vent alittle?? I'ma do it anyway, So over the school holidays I went to my CAMHS appointment (Australian CAMHS) and the first talk was good I talked about stuff, and by the end I felt like they where listing, they then called in my mum to talk about seeking help and she said something to my mum that freaked me out ""I'm pretty concerned TBH"" she the went to call the hospital and sent us on our way, I spent the next week trying not to think about the second appointment and when the day came it was around when dad and I where about to get some Boba to calm me down I, flipped out and shutdown(happens alot) I told him I didn't want the tea anymore and that we should just go to CAMHS and get it over with I was still in my flipped state and couldn't think clearly when I got called in they had a psychologist in the room to talk to me, at the time I felt that I was normal and answered the questions that me at the time thought was correct and somehow defused the situation.
Afterwards I flipped back and regreted not telling them stuff, I can't remember what I said before but I think that I may have lied about the answers or didn't answer them properly without knowing.

I'm 16 and I recently had a sexual conversation with a 25 year old because they kept hinting at me and I just wanted to feeling to dissappear. I feel disgusting and dirty. A massive part of me didn't want to have that conversation but I didn't want them to think I wasn't enjoying it so I played along.

They kept asking to see a picture of my face because I was so pretty to them. I said no 3 or 4 times but eventually gave in and sent them one. They kept saying things that were wrong like about their dick size or asking me if they got into bed with me and hugged me and got a 'semi' (hard) if I would kick them out. But the going 'sorry' after but they kept doing it. It feels as if its my fault though because he asked if I was okay and I said yes. I should've said no. They know about my past and I made it clear I wasn't doing okay. They stopped for a bit but then it continued. I wasn't okay. I don't normally do this. I don't want any drama from this or anything I just need to vent. They know I'm 16 and I have a past of this. I have issues where I devalue myself to the point of feeling like I should just let men use me. I guess you could say I did here too. I didn't want to. They kept asking how 'down there' was doing and they had this vision in their head that when we meet, he'll show me a good time. He said how he wanted to be there to make me feel good. He said how he'd hug me and never let go and even mentioned how he prefers blowjobs to sex. In the moment I was uncomfortable and said no a few times but I just gave into it

Examples:

I get a weird feeling inside when my gf gets excited about something like a new article of clothing or a new plushie or something. I like when sheâ€™s happy but sometimes seeing her abundant happiness makes me cry. 
When I think about old people I get kinda sad. Like the thought of your mind and body  getting weaker and having trouble keeping up with the ever changing world. It really scares me. 
I donâ€™t really like a lot of â€œcringeâ€ content out there because it revolves around shitting on people living their best lives. I donâ€™t talk about hobbies or interests with ANYBODY.

the chances are, iâ€™m either being moved to AMHS or im being totally discharged (since itâ€™s harder to qualify for AMHS than CAMHS). 

if i donâ€™t get moved to AMHS and i get discharged, im scared that iâ€™ll experience another episode (which is inevitable, since i go in cycles with my mood, due to my bipolar) and not have any help. im also scared that theyâ€™ll stop giving me my antipsychotics, since iâ€™ve gotten better, despite the fact iâ€™ve only been on quetiapine since july last year.

"""Help, I'm on fire!"" screams a man in a plaza. The people around him turn to see that indeed, he has caught flame and is in grave peril of burning to death. They rush to his aid. The flames are extinguished, and relieved congratulations are shared all around. A life has been saved.

This is attention-seeking behavior doing its job. When a person is in danger, and panics, and cannot help themselves, they seem to instinctively cry out for assistance to anyone nearby. At its most basal level, this is what we know as ""attention-seeking behavior."" Over a period of time, and with liberal application, it's become a ""dirty"" phrase, something we know to be morally reprehensible with our illuminated views of the world and its contents. It's something we have little patience for, and offhandedly condemn. It's the way of the world, we say. 

I posit that ""attention-seeking behaviors"" are desperate cries from individuals that need assistance. Whether or not we know how to help, we are in no place to condemn such a cry for help. When did crying for help become reprehensible? There are realms of suffering that are not immediately apparent to every person. That does not mean there is no peril. 

At every age and stage of life people need help for infinite various reasons. There's always something going on. It's inconvenient to be asked for help. It's terrible when there is no help to offer. It hurts immensely when there is nothing you can find to ease the pain of someone begging for relief. That's our empathy. 

I propose that it is inhumane and cruel to attempt to mitigate the suffering of the caregiver by placing blame and contempt upon the suffering. It is the first, most natural response to do so, obviously. It is a horrible thing to help someone you love die. Anyone who hasn't experienced it has a difficult time comprehending what it means. It involves a lot of resentment. 

There is so much resentment towards the people we feel we cannot help. We cannot stand to hate ourselves for our inability to help them, the pain is too great and too deep. Generally we resort to blaming them for inflicting their pain upon us. It's why we see jaded doctors who despise their patients. It's the source of abuse in hospice and elder care homes. We hate the things we cannot stop, the things that we may well yet become. It is terrifying.

I suggest, as an aid, a certain indulgence in personal suffering. A recognition of pain, versus its rejection. To understand and accept your own valid suffering is not to deny the suffering of other people. We all suffer together.  We all have that in common.",General_disorder
"Hello. Iâ€™m not looking for pity but also probably cannot handle anything too mean right now. In October I (17F) met this guy (20M). We got really close and I really really started to like him and we were hooking up multiple times a week. He didnâ€™t like me back but I kept telling myself it was okay. There was one night after we were done fucking we were laying in bed together and I wanted to go again. A few days before I made him want to go again by touching his penis and it was fine. This time he said no and I kind of brushed it off as like a â€œhaha silly haha heheâ€ thing. Before my hand got under the pants I realized he was really uncomfortable because he was frozen and unresponsive so I stopped. I think the reason I did that was because before we fucked he told me he didnâ€™t want to be in a relationship with me so I guess I wanted to hurt him. I apologized and told him I think I sexually assaulted him. A few days later he blocked me everywhere and I had to beg him to let me stay in his life. This wasnâ€™t the first time he blocked me either. The first time he did I drove to his house in the middle of the night crying to get him to unblock me. So he finally said yes and we were gonna hang out again just as friends and see where we were. I told myself that I would do things right this time. Never would I ever hurt him again. I donâ€™t know what during that hang out happened but a switch just flipped. I knew he wanted to be set free by me so I told him if he fucks me one last time I will leave his life forever, I just wanted to have one last good memory with him and not have it all be bad. He wouldnâ€™t. I kept pressing. He pulled out his voice memo and asked me to say it again. I didnâ€™t say anything. I donâ€™t remember what happened between the voice recorder and what iâ€™m about to talk about. I remember telling him â€œiâ€™ve already gone too farâ€ and climbing on top of him and trying to kiss him and he hit me in the face and threw me across the room. I layed there on the floor for a little bit. I remember smiling and laughing a little bit. I was excited by the â€œchallengeâ€ I guess. I donâ€™t know. When I got up I kept trying. He pushed me away again and stormed out of his room, screaming. I collected my things and saw him sobbing and his mom was holding him. She was just staring at me in fear and confusion. For the next hour he would just be screaming at me that he hates me and to get out of the house and that iâ€™m a rapist. And his mom was in the corner having a panic attack as was i.

Iâ€™m disgusted. I traumatized him. And I enjoyed it. What would I have done if he didnâ€™t push me off? Why did I SMILE?! I still harassed him for 2 weeks through different phone numbers after this happened. Now that the antipsychotics (latuda) that I started recently have kind of set in I havenâ€™t tried to contact him at all. I have my first appointment with a therapist on thursday. I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s enough. Iâ€™ve apologized to him but I know itâ€™s not enough. I am deciding on either turning myself in or killing myself. Like Iâ€™m not even saying that in a way to get attention. I need to stop hurting everyone I come in contact with. No human who deserves to live would ever get excited while physically assaulted someone. I knew what I was doing in the moment I canâ€™t even blame it on something like my BPD and bipolar and I was sober so I canâ€™t say I was under the influence. I hope that he can heal. I donâ€™t trust myself to not flip a switch again and try to contact and manipulate him because what I think one day is different the next. I feel like a slave to my emotions constantly flipping on a whim and everyone says you are in control of your actions but the whole time i was doing that i was inside of myself screaming at myself to stop and praying to God to kill me now or smite me or stop me do something. I need to kill myself to stop the cycle and let him HEAL. Or turn myself in at least. Then he could have the justice he needs.",General_disorder
I've had anxiety for the last couple of years. I'm also getting voices when I'm about asleep. I was told these are probably normal hypnagogic hallucinations. I also wake up from really vivid dreams.

I force myself to have hobbies and to try to build something outside of my 8-5 so that I can feel like a worthy enough person. I feel like giving up and doing nothing all the time. Even when I am with people I care about Iâ€™m somewhere else in my head. I have lapses in my memory now. I donâ€™t ever recall it being this bad. I can only remember things for a minute before I forget about it entirely. I feel unloved and unaccepted by everyone. I know there is so much that I wish to do in life but canâ€™t find the inspiration or shake my apathy enough to do it. No matter how much I work myself outside of my job it never feels like enough. Itâ€™s as if each morning that I wake up I feel disappointment that Iâ€™m still alive. It really just feels like Iâ€™m forcing myself to have a purpose because my family would never recover if I died. The days are slipping by too fast and Iâ€™m only getting older.

Ive learned to accept him where he is. ive learned im his partner not caregiver. insight???

I was doing really good this past month, managing my mental health for what seemed like the first time in my life. Iâ€™ve been taking my meds, studying, getting sleep, doing things I enjoy, implementing boundaries, avoiding self-destructive behaviours.. I feel so pathetic for saying this next part but Iâ€™m not exactly sure who to reach out to or what to do anymore. 

Last night I swallowed about 9 Advils after taking my meds. I knew that 9 pills would do barely anything but give me a mild stomach ache, yet I couldnâ€™t get the thought out of my head. So I did it. I couldnâ€™t do it for years and I felt like a coward, so I came to peace with it last night. I swallowed all of them in about 2 goes and went to bed. I had bad stomach cramps and tossed and turned all night, and woke up just feeling really light headed and tired. I didnâ€™t cry, I didnâ€™t really feel scared.. just super numb. And I still feel numb. 
 
Today I am floating out of body with no desire to get out of my bed. I feel stuck because for a while I felt like I could move forward and be strong, now I feel so weak and small. The worst part is I donâ€™t regret my actions. I feel like I could do it again but way worse. And maybe this was just an action of courage, of proof I could actually end myself without stopping. I feel bad for my thoughts but theyâ€™re always there like a constant reminder of who I am and what overtakes me. I want to change but I donâ€™t know how. And Iâ€™m so tired.",General_disorder
"Hello all. My partner (26) recently lost their health insurance due to the parentsâ€™ lack of effort. Not joking. Anyways, for my partner to continue seeking care, namely therapy and a psychiatrist most likely, we are needing to get them some health insurance so they can get a diagnosis, and the treatment they need. 




We live in North East Georgia, in the blue ridge mountains to be precise without being too exact. My partner is unemployed and will need affordable / low-income health insurance. I and the parents will be paying for this, unless I can do it myself (I would like to). We do not have a specific doctor or establishment picked out yet. So I canâ€™t tell you what insurances they accept. 





1- What are our options? 




2- Is there a super cheap / free insurance and will it be accepted at a high percentage of offices? 




3- is there a low-income / unemployment discount? 




4- is there a cheaply priced option that is largely accepted? 




5- is there anything we should know: tips, tricks, be aware of, doâ€™s and dontâ€™s, etc...

"It's foggy, the wind whispers through the vague forms of trees. Is it the wind? It is, but it's also the things that lurk in the fog, making their presence known. 

I wander, keeping my distance from the things I don't want to see. Sometimes their shapes loom out of the fog, and I know what they are, and I turn away, knowing that they will crush me and tear me to bits. Some are sharper than others, some louder and more obvious, and yet some lie low to the ground, fuzzier, fainter; but no less dangerous. 

As I come upon these things I turn and walk in another direction. Sometimes I run. If I stop moving, they will find me. 

I spot it. My escape. The sweet, blissful, quiet cliff, dropping off into the abyss. I move toward it, one foot in front of the other, the steady beat of my heart thundering in my ears, as though it knows where I am headed. I've been there before. The tips of my fingers become numb as I approach the edge, coming closer and closer to seeing what lies at the bottom. I close my eyes, take a breath, and step right to the precipice, looking down to see what is below. 

It doesn't look like I want it to. I see faces. A little tiny face, bundled in the midst of a stark white blanket, eyes wide and staring at me. With the face comes a whisper, and I hear myself; ""I will keep you safe, always, I promise."" The face morphs, and becomes one of pride, and adoration. She doesn't want me to go over. 

Another face crystallizes. A bright, shining face, smiling. Promising to love and cherish. Forever. I hear myself agreeing, promising the same, feeling it with every fiber of my being, the need to be near it, the need to protect, and love. The face looks me deep in the eyes, with an intensity that makes my soul ache. She needs me to not go over. 

A new face, a kind, laughing one, cracking up at some nonsense I can't understand. Playing some game of make believe. I hear myself laughing along, but it's hollow, distant, like it's too far away to make it through the miles of fog all around. The eyes become sad, and filled with pity, and then fade away. He can't watch me go over. 

I look down, watching a scene unfold below. People mulling around, speaking in muted tones. Tears fall to the ground as they embrace each other, trying to come to terms with something beyond them. They don't understand. And I know at the heart of it is me. Just past where I can see through the fog is something that they all go to look at. I don't study it. I can't look for too long, or I might just make out the shape of what sits there, causing these people so much pain. 

I look around, hoping maybe this time I can find something. But there's no ladder, or rope, or anything to bring them to me, pull them up the cliff so that they might understand. The cliff is too tall for them to make it anyway, they'd get tired part way through the climb and give up. 

I can hear the things behind me growing closer, whispering to me. I know that if I stand here for too long one will come along and push me over the cliff. They are gathered just out of sight, fuzzy outlines that I can barely distinguish, but each of them distinct nonetheless. 

I lean over, and a drop of water falls over the edge of the cliff. Then another. I touch my face and feel it's wet. My tears fall to the ground with those of the people below. A tingle shoots up the back of my neck, and I shiver, covered in goosebumps. Can they feel me watching? Do they know I can see what they are going through? Do they even know that I care about their immense grief? 

I want to escape the things closing in around me so badly. And this is the only exit. I don't have any weapons, I can't slay the things that wait around every turn, waiting to gobble me up. I often wonder if such a weapon even exists. Can they be defeated? Or will they be there, looking over my shoulder, haunting me forever? 

I look down once more and see nothing but a black, sucking abyss. And yet it looks inviting. It calls to me. My toes hang over the edge, and I can feel the icy cold wind blowing through the darkness, swirling around. The promise of nothing, sweet, quiet nothing, right in front of me. It would be such a relief. 

But the faces have come back. They are broken, shattered, fragments of something that feels bigger than my own need. I scream into the void, angry, defeated. I am sweating, shaking, my voice cracks and my throat burns. Nobody can hear it, it is sucked into the black hole below. 

I take a deep breath, take one last peek, and take a step back. I can wait. I can keep walking, and running, and hiding, because they need me to. If I go, they will take my place here, and I will become one of the things lurking in the fog, threatening to tear them apart. 

For now, I can wait.",General_disorder

"I have read the rules and understand that asking for a diagnosis and such isn't allowed, im not asking for that but instead I'm asking that anyone who has dealt with something similar please leave advise of what they've found to help.

To begin with my gf is 26 and a special needs teacher, she's a great person and until seeing these happen id have never known about it. We haven't been together for that long but just recently I learned of these ""blackouts"" for lack of a better word. They apparently started 3 years ago after she had something very traumatic happen to her which i don't want to share, but she hasn't had them happen often or anywhere near as severe as these recent ones have been. She's afraid of how all this looks and is embarrassed and afraid to go to be seen about it. I've been trying to do my own research to get some idea of what this could be but I'm falling short as nothing I've found have the same symptoms.

In these ""blackouts"" she completely loses all memory of them happening, at best she can remember a couple words said. We're still not sure what triggers are for them as shed gone a long time without them then shes had 2 of the worst ever the past 2 days. They seem to begin with her getting a migraine and becoming dizzy, after that she becomes increasingly agitated, her tone of voice changes, she seems defensive, and her breathing becomes very rapid. If you ask her if she's alright she'll start a verbal loop of saying ""I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine"". For a few minutes she becomes manic and wants to try to do 10 things at once all of a sudden wanting to clean and cook and do other things around the house while also finding ways to blame herself and apologize if I try to get her to rest. For example if im telling her to please take deep breaths and sit down for a minute she'll once again start a verbal loop of saying ""I'm sorry I'm sorry"" and saying how stupid, etc.. she is. This stage of the ""blackout"" seems to last 20 or so minutes followed by her not being very verbal for a short period of time and then moving on to the final stage. At this point her breathing normalizes and she calms down but she's spaced out and begins talking like a 4 or 5yr old girl in a soft calm voice. She's responsive and will carry on a conversation if you're persistent but her responses are that of a child, she's confused, will say how badly her head hurts, and for anything concerning how she feels she'll say ""I'm fine"" but ""I don't know"" to most other questions. Yesterday was the worst one yet and she was talking to me on the phone when this happened, thankfully her daughter was at her parents house when this happened but she saw her daughters stuffed cow and was able to carry on talking about how she found a cow. This lasted for at least 25 minutes before she almost instantly snapped out of it in a complete panic and had no memory of the nearly 2hr conversation we'd been having, her dad at work, our conversations throughout the day, and had apparently not responded to anyone else that day even her boss's message.

Obviously this scared the hell out of me the first time it happened because I didn't know about it once again because shes so embarrassed by it. At this point im just really worried and concerned and will continue trying to convince her to be seen for it and try to get help. In the meantime if anyone has had experience with anything remotely like this I would really appreciate advise on what might have worked to calm them down before it got to this point, what helps them recover faster, and what might help in the middle of it to get them back faster. I really appreciate it, thanks.",General_disorder

Although if it's too much I'll take a full 2mg.

I'm also prescribed nitrazepam 5-10mg at night as a prn.

Then I'm prescribed 300mg pregabalin twice a day for extra anxiety support.

I'm honestly blessed, most psychiatrists in my city don't prescribe double benzos, pregabalin and it's nearly impossible to gain enough trust to get a legal amphetamine script.

"Hello everyone,

Horrible person here.

Almost two and a half years ago, I did a big mistake and it gave me an opportunity that I shouldn't have. I CHEATED on an scholarship exam and won a 2000$ -ish- scholarship to an online course to learn front-end web development\* . and after I won I completed the course for 3 months and won the certificate and then it hit me.

From that point it all went downhill for me.

What I wanted to do for the rest of my life?, What I enjoyed learning since I was 9 -doing blogs and forums and designing UI's-, The only scape from the world, the safe place that I had I RUINED it all.

After that I couldn't learn or even watch a video or see the words or hear it without feeling the guilt. I mean how could I?! I am a cheater. Should I build my career and learn more, enjoy it, keep moving ,keep working, Design, code and build?

The answer is

No, I couldn't build a life based on a lie.

Ok let's try to take a break and start again.

I tried to do that and studied from a different website tried to forget what I learned and learn it again It seems stupid, But I really tried and I couldn't.

The realization that I am a really horrible person I ruined someone's life by stealing their opportunity may be they needed that more than me, what if they more poor, what if they had a worse life, what .., what..., and what... ?

So I am the villain in someone's story, and it's worse I ruined my life too, So I am the villain in my own story.

Then I found the answer, If I can't do what I love, Why should I live?

I got depressed for a really long time and tried to stress my self to death, but does that works?

I got hypertension, took my medications for sometime and stopped it by my self, took it again, on and off for several times including shy attempts to overdose on it, but it didn't work. and I stopped until two days ago I couldn't sleep I thought that was my time to die, but yeah at 5 am I couldn't take it any more and I took my medications -Weak- ,and some self-harming here and there with boiling water because it felt good.

So maybe just get a job with my degree and forget what I want to do just to have a future.

Tried that for 10 month I just felt like a slave going to work at 6:15AM and getting home at 5:30 to 6 PM without good money and being stressed all day I hated my life even more and .... Wait a minute Did I got this degree by cheating in high-school 7 years ago is that what almost all the student did in high-school finals and our degrees determined which college we are going to?

Oh it's happening again.

I was a bad person from the beginning . I build my life on lies and cheats I don't want to live anymore I have no future I can't think what I should do tomorrow I just wish I don't wakeup and I deserve the most painful death.

It feels really bad realizing that you achieved nothing in your life.

My family lived a lot of bad times because of me, My mother is hear broken and she wants to see me happy even for a day, and my father wants a man that can at least handle him self, let alone help him and his family.

I tried to learn something new entirely, but all my interests included programming which I learnt my first programming language by chelating, So I live all the previous moments again and again and again.

I am stuck in a limbo and I don't know what should I do?

I am very sorry for this extremely long post, Actually it is my longest written post ever even in my native language.

Also I am not native I learnt a lot of my English through watching gaming and entertainment videos online -not by cheating this time-, So I am sorry for my bad English.",General_disorder

"I was diagnosed with ADD when I was younger but I feel like itâ€™s not what I actually have. Every morning I wake up depressed, no drive or excitement for the day. I worry about everything horribly, canâ€™t make decisions, I feel emotionless half my day, I randomly space out to the point where I canâ€™t focus my eyes sometimes, I canâ€™t think and my mind is foggy through a lot of the day, then Iâ€™ll randomly get really happy or excited, I am paranoid that Iâ€™m losing my mind and that Iâ€™m not normal, have a short temper randomly, I have horrible anxiety I do know that. I constantly think people are angry at me when they are not (mostly with my parents), I feel guilty all the time for no reason, Iâ€™m scared thereâ€™s something wrong with me, I have a fear of me not being mentally ok, I have a fear of becoming a failure in life. I just feel like thereâ€™s something really wrong with me but I canâ€™t understand or pinpoint what it is. Ever since I graduated highschool something just clicked and I feel like Iâ€™ve completely changed and gone downhill mentally. At one point in my life I had sleep issues because I was scared of not being able to fall asleep which caused me to not be able to fall asleep. I feel like Iâ€™m constantly in my head all day. Some days I feel pretty good and others I donâ€™t. I have extreme anxiety problems. I also  forget where I put things a lot and I will forget things, Iâ€™ll be talking to someone and I have to focus really hard to understand what they are saying and what it means or Iâ€™ll space out and forget what I just talked about. Im also in a very stressful moment of my life which could contribute to this problem although im usually stressed alot of the time due to my anxiety. I also sometimes canâ€™t sit down because I feel guilty for doing it and need to get up and do something. I sometimes hate to be alone because of my thoughts and they never seem to go positive it just turns into worry. I have a really hard time explaining how I feel.Sorry for no paragraphs and bad grammar. It always seems like my friends are trying to annoy me. I wish I could see life from someone elseâ€™s perspective because I donâ€™t know if mine is normal. I rethink over everything and am a over-thinker. But the main issue Iâ€™ve noticed is that my mind is blank a lot and sometimes I have to actually try to think and use my brain.",General_disorder

I donâ€™t condone or recommend self harm in any way but I just honestly give advice to people all the time but it doesnâ€™t feel like it applies to me the same way it does whenever Iâ€™m trying to help a friend who has opened up to me. I always try to hide what Iâ€™m feeling because I want to be there for my friends whenever they feel bad but honestly I just donâ€™t know what to do.

Iâ€™ll think about it  constantly. Usually it gets better by day 2. And sometimes events from my past will come back and the same thing will happen. I was wondering if anyone else goes through this.

"I don't behave in the way that most people would. I have trouble understanding other people's intentions towards me and understanding basic social cues.

Like, when I suddenly flew to another country unannounced to relatives I haven't seen in 17 years during Christmas in Germany, having an affair with my aunt's husband, my interactions with my former professor who is 40 years older than me and he sent me hundreds and hundreds of emails where most girls would be creeped out.

When I was in love with women decades older than me, like my 50 year old teacher when I was 16, I thought she was in love with me just because she was nice to me and always said my name, said I grew taller, calling me a ""fine young lady"", liking my hair and shoes, and noticed me. My interpretation her actions were unrealistic, and I thought she was leading me on. I even told her I liked her. It wasn't just with her but for a few others as well. It also happened with another teacher, a couple of my coworkers, a woman in a Zumba class.

I also have this thing where I make this eye contact. It's not like I don't make eye contact, I make too much eye contact. I tend to gaze into people's eyes when talk to me, and I look at their eyes even when the conversation is over or I have nothing to say. I have received a couple of complaints about this, but I still keep doing it. People tell me ""Why are you looking at me like that?""

I also never call people by their names. Like, my coworkers have called me by my name a thousand times, a million times, but I have never called anyone by their name even once. I have received a few complaints about this and someone said ""Do you even know my name?""

Also with my relationship with my coworkers, my ability to build relationships is impaired because of my past and the people who hurt me. I don't have any friends. I push everyone away because I want to do what was done to me to them. Like I had a coworker who was nice to me and suddenly I ignored her whenever she greeted me. I think I hurt her because she seemed upset. When she saw me and said ""How are you?"" I just said ""Good."" I am also unable to make reality based conversations with my coworkers and everyone else.",General_disorder

"I remember when my friend invited me to her 16th birthday party when we were both 16. At that time, we hadn't seen each other since 8th grade and only talked online. She knows I'm shy. That was the only time we saw each other in person. â€‹When I was at the party, I didn't talk to her or anyone there. I just sat and ate. I don't even think she even heard my voice. There were many people that she invited, they were mostly people from her school, there were about 30-40 people. I didn't even greet her hello or say happy birthday when I arrived at the party, because my mom accompanied me and she was the one who greeted her and said happy birthday. I just handed her my birthday gift for her.

I remember before the party, she told me that she thought it would be nice for us to chat and talk a little bit, but it never actually happened. She didn't even try to talk to me either. It wasn't like she ever pulled me aside and said, ""Hey, how are you? Let's talk."" She did not make any effort to talk to me or start a conversation. I noticed she tried to talk to all of the other people there except me. It's like we both waited for the other to talk, and nothing ever happened. When the party was over, I walked away without telling her bye and she said ""Bye"" and I turned around and she opened her arms for me to hug her. I did not even thank her for inviting me. Then everything deteriorated from there. She still talked to me online, but it was less often as before and it all eventually stopped. I remember when I ran into her a year after that at an event, she didn't even smile at me or looked happy to see me. She also never invited me ever again to her parties or to anything. We never met again except for when we ran into each other.

I did not talk at the party. She did not make any effort to talk to me, either. Was I in the wrong or her? Did she think I was rude? Was inviting me to her party something that she wished she never even did?",General_disorder
"Itâ€™s just this dull ache that permeates all the way down to my bones. Wish I could figure out how to turn off this particular need. Donâ€™t belong around people, I need to be alone for my own well-being, so thereâ€™s no way for me to fill this void. Just wish my brain would figure that out and stop sending that impulses that make me crave it.

Itâ€™s not just the physical sensations, but also the constant reminders. Canâ€™t watch a show or movie without having to sit through some romance subplot. Canâ€™t take a walk without seeing couples everywhere you go. I canâ€™t even escape it when I sleep because my brain insists on forcing me to dream about being with a girlfriend or having sex with a girl I used to know somehow. I canâ€™t get away from it and it only makes the physical ache worse.

Without getting into why, I canâ€™t have friends, canâ€™t be around my family, definitely canâ€™t have a girlfriend. I canâ€™t even have casual hookups anymore because my past experiences with sex have been awful. Never been able to orgasm during it and now all those experiences just twist my stomach up into a weird, sick feeling when I think about how I had to try and explain to the girl I was with that my body just seems to be broken. Feels humiliating, being a guy who canâ€™t have sex, knowing that every woman Iâ€™ve been with probably remembers me as the worst sex theyâ€™ve ever had cause Iâ€™m some kinda broken freak. So thereâ€™s just no avenue for me to fulfil this need so I donâ€™t know why itâ€™s gotta keep hounding me, wish I could just turn it off. 

Closest I can get to scratching the itch is hugging a damn pillow in bed every night, pretending itâ€™s a pretty girl cradled in my arms. Doesnâ€™t matter how much I try to paint the picture though, how many little details I try to imagine, like picturing the softness of her skin against mine, or hearing her gentle breathing, or running my fingers across the curves of her body, the subtle scent of feminine perfume in the air, the comfort of her warm body pressed against mine lulling me to sleep, doesnâ€™t matter how intricate the fantasy gets, it still doesnâ€™t come anywhere close to having it for real. 

So Iâ€™m just left here knowing Iâ€™d need to feel connected with someone to ever fix the touch-starvation, but also knowing Iâ€™ve got attachment trauma so severe that Iâ€™ll never be able to connect with another human enough to get to that point. Itâ€™s become debilitating and itâ€™s all I can think about. And not medication or years of therapy have been able to even make a dent in it. Iâ€™m just irreparably broken.",General_disorder
"Iâ€™m a 20 year old female and married to a 24 year old female. For context, I grew up extremely poor and with no resources. Once I turned 18, I had to find a way to support myself which meant I had to drop out of high school with no diploma. I met my spouse when I was homeless and couch surfing. In true lesbian fashion, we moved in together quickly and rushed into a relationship, then marriage. We fight a lot and Iâ€™m constantly afraid of us ending the relationship and me being homeless again. The fighting was especially bad this last summer and I was sure that I was going to be on my own again, so I quickly starting looking for other arrangements. I met 25 year old guy that was nice and seemed understanding to my situation. We started off platonic but we fell in love. I stayed with him for a weekend and we slept together just that once. After that weekend he ended it. I found out I was pregnant about 2 weeks later after a late period. He was the first person I told, but he told me that he wanted nothing to do with me or the baby. I waited until after my first ultrasound to tell my spouse what I had done and that I was pregnant. She was understandably angry and hurt. She cried and yelled and threw things but she didnâ€™t kick me out or leave me. She said she wanted to raise the baby together. She told everyone that we had paid for a sperm donor. This pregnancy has be incredibly hard and deemed high risk (Iâ€™ve had health problems and severe mental illness for a long time). I was diagnosed with preeclampsia recently, so Iâ€™ve been put on bed rest.

Itâ€™s too late for an abortion and I canâ€™t give him up because that wouldnâ€™t make sense to both of our families that we told the sperm donor story to. I feel like the only way to get any relief is to take my life. I canâ€™t stand the thought of bringing this baby into the world and I know that Iâ€™m not meant to be a mother.

I used to take medication, but I donâ€™t anymore, but I also do fine without medication, it wasnâ€™t super helpful and the side effects were very unpleasant. I do fine without medication usually, I just practice good self care and Iâ€™ve made it out of multiple episodes.

Canâ€™t even get myself to do them. Spending time with people? Yeah, distracts me but I feel immediately bad after. Comfort foods? Momentary relief. 


Iâ€™m worried sick and I donâ€™t like my behaviors, I already fucked up one of my relationships because of this recent behavior and that makes me feel worse. I keep ruminating on this and other things and I canâ€™t seem to escape the intrusive thoughts like I usually do.

"i just need to vent, and i wasnâ€™t sure where else to do it.

iâ€™m a 20F full time university student and i just moved out of home a few months ago to live on campus. itâ€™s been a great experience so far, made some new friends and since i donâ€™t drive i can just walk everywhere and itâ€™s super convenient. i even got to move close to my boyfriend and itâ€™s been great to spend all the time together that we didnâ€™t have during all of the lockdowns.

the only issue is that itâ€™s super expensive - this initially wasnâ€™t a problem since i work casually and had a fair bit of money saved to get me through until i could claim government support. however, just due to unforeseen circumstances and such itâ€™s taken a lot longer than i had initially planned to even submit a claim for government support, let alone be accepted and get paid.

iâ€™ve run out of money, rent is due today, i canâ€™t even afford food and medication for my depression/anxiety and ADHD. to top it all off, i got an email from a psychiatrists office that i went to over a YEAR ago saying i needed to settle a balance of $440, which they wanted by today. i canâ€™t pay rent let alone a year old fee i had completely forgotten about.

iâ€™m so scared. iâ€™d ask for help but i donâ€™t want to owe anyone else anymore money because itâ€™s just going to kill me. all of this has just been piling up over the past couple of months and i can feel my depression and anxiety creeping back to a severity i havenâ€™t experienced since i was in my teens. i canâ€™t even ask for psychological help because i canâ€™t afford it. australia has a pretty decent healthcare system, but mental health is just something thatâ€™s so insanely neglected.

my boyfriend had work today, he had a super long shift and he didnâ€™t get any sleep last night so when he finished work he was super tired and needed my help with some stuff.

he asked me to fill his car with petrol, and since i donâ€™t drive i have no experience with cars at all and iâ€™d never been taught how to do it. i said iâ€™d do it because i wanted to help and i felt bad making him get out of the car to do it after such a big day, especially with it being so hot outside. he had bought me food after his shift too because he knew i couldnâ€™t afford it and i just wanted to be there for him and do something small.

i couldnâ€™t figure out how to get the cap off to fill the tank, and my boyfriend got frustrated and did it himself and i just felt so useless and stupid. 

we had to drive a fair distance from home to run some errands after this and i decided to stop at the chemist to pick up my ADHD medication. iâ€™d never been to this chemist before, so they wanted to call my psychiatrist to verify my script but he wasnâ€™t in today so they have to wait until tomorrow. i decided to pay for the medication in full today so i could just come back to pick it up after theyâ€™ve verified, not thinking that this would mean my boyfriend would have to drive me all the way back to pick it up tomorrow. i feel so inconsiderate and stupid.

he wanted me to help him kill a spider in his room this afternoon and the bug spray nozzle was broken and the spray went all over my hands. he said i should just kill the spider another way but i was too scared.

i feel so awful and idk iâ€™m not looking for sympathy i just needed to vent. my mental health has been plummeting lately and iâ€™m worried that things are only going to get worse. i know a lot of people have it much worse than me so i donâ€™t really have a right to complain but i just honestly donâ€™t know what else to do at this point.",General_disorder

And Iâ€™m 22 years old, and I fear that any time God Almighty can take my soul any time without being fully prepared for Hereafter.

Am I mentally sick?! What is happening to me?!! How can I develop greatest love?!

P.S. the reason for asking such question is because I fear a lot hypocrisy and I wish to be relieved from worry which I have. And I was hoping that Autism and Asperger would make me be naturally inclined towards science and engineering just so I can study science and engineering easily, because all I want is to revolutionize the entire world in miraculous way.

"Good morning everyone,

The reason I ask this question is because, God Almighty ordered mankind to avoid listening to music and movies as they contain forbidden things. And He also revealed to us end time prophesy that people will allow musical instruments and intoxicants at end of times. 

And my mom orders me to study for exams, but the problem is that someone she is very tyrant and oppressive, and I seek rebellion against her authority, because I canâ€™t handle it anymore. 

And I feel the need of disobeying God so I can watch movies and listen to music, and I really wish for me to obey God Almighty the Lord of the Worlds. 

I donâ€™t mean to do â€œpick and chooseâ€

"Hellooooo, 
A few days ago my depression lifted and everything seemed like it was better but almost too good. Food tasted better and outside seemed brighter and more colorful. I have been on wellbutrin for 3 or 4 months. Today I have been extremely hyper. It started with racing thoughts and getting distracted very easily. I also had impulsive thoughts I tried to keep away but they got the best of me. I ended up drinking alcohol and dancing to music for like an hour. Then I texted a friend maybe having bipolar disorder since If you google what is the cause of mania from wellbutrin it says bipolar disorder. Later I went on a run at 1 am. I came back and started playing games and doing random bullshit. At 3 am i started playing basjetball in some courts at my apartment alone. Im almkst certain I am manic and I was windering If this is a strong indicator of bipolar disorder. These actions are very unnormal for me.

" My birthday is tomorrow. I am in a really bad time in my life. I know that people love me but I don't understand how or why. I am socially awkward to an extreme level and when I try to talk to people about it they always say something like ""Oh, I completely understand! I'm so awkward too! Haha!"" But they don't. They don't understand how deeply this goes for me. It ruins my life. I lose my ""friends"". I lose opportunities in my life. Socializing is so important in society. Ever since I was a little girl, I had many times where I just sat there watching other kids laughing and playing and I just didn't understand. I didn't understand how it came so naturally. I've almost always been that kid who people just pretended to like because they felt sorry for me. 

Lately I've been struggling in school more than usual. Constantly skipping classes. Getting in trouble with teachers and crying in front of them. Leaving class at random moments. Failing every assignment or just refusing to do them. Sleeping for entire class periods. Having breakdowns in the bathroom. I've showed up to school intoxicated on multiple occasions. I don't want to do well in school either because that bores me so deeply. I feel so empty. I do stupid things to fill the emptiness for a couple hours. People think I don't care about school. The truth is that I care so deeply about everything that I just turn it off and do the opposite. 

I've been having emotional outbursts constantly, that affect my life more than they need to. I can still function sort of. I get so sad over such tiny things. I just sobbed for hours because I thought a distant friend didn't like me anymore. She does. I cry in public all the time. No matter where I am, I can't stop the emotions. I have happy outbursts too but they aren't always good. I get too hyperactive and everyone gets so annoyed with me. I act like a 5 year old. I also start breaking more rules and being overly impulsive. I don't want these to stop either because that's just who I am. But I hate them.

Lastly, I think that I want to kill myself. I don't really want to die right now. Although I have very much on other days. I just want people to notice me. I've thought about purposely failing a suicide attempt. The only thing that stops me is knowing how upset my mother and father would be. Nobody takes me seriously. I know that I just want attention. Or to be seen as ""the girl who tried to kill herself"" though that would be really embarrassing. Wow. I am a bad person.",General_disorder
"
I have this problem where I uncontrollably lie about everything even extreme stuf and I know it makes me a terrible person and I hate myself for it.

Whenever I'm talking to someone i probably manage to lie about small to big things atleast once in conversation, the worst lies ive ever told where as follows. I lied to my mom, my friends, my online friends and others and I told them that my friend tried to kill themselves the night before so my mom would feel bad about yelling at me. I also made this whole 4 week fiasco up where I told my friend once that I was at risk of diabetes because they asked me why I was underweight and it kind of spirralled into this big thing where I pretended I had a stomach bug or something that was related to the diabetes and I pretended I was throwing up in the toilets at school 24/7 so I could get out of school work and I even lied to my teacher about it. Only 2 of the times that I said I was throwing up where times where I actually did, and I made myself throwup those 2 times so they don't count. When I seem boring normally I'll lie to make myself seem more interesting, I massively blow things out of perportion and i dangerously overexaggerate everything. I practice lying to myself in the mirror and pretend to manipulate people into not thinking im a bad person if they catch my lie and constantly gaslight and manipulate the people around me and I hate it so much because all I want to be able to do is live a life where im not constantly lying about everything to everyone.

"just going to say this now, please do not tell me to talk to a professional. i have talked to a lot of them over the past 5/6 years. not a single one of them has understood part of what i experience because it's just... weird. i have a lot of other issues going on but literally nothing explains this. i don't want to explain all of it again but if you want to know more just look at my post history.

basically i started maladaptive daydreaming when i was around 6 due to trauma, lost control over it, and now i'm stuck because no one i explain it to understands or relates. it's definitely past maladaptive daydreaming by this point, but i don't know what the hell is going on. i wouldn't care about having a label for what i experience if it weren't for the fact no one has been able to help me and i can't find a single person who experiences anything like this. i feel so alone.

people keep suggesting psychosis or DID but i'm not really sure if it's either of those. i'm sure i have a dissociative disorder but i don't think the fictional characters in my head are alters or anything like that because of how easily they can enter my head, they never take control, and it's mixed with regularly being paranoid that i'm in their world instead of reality (again, just look at my post history if you want to know more about that). there's a difference between the ""parts"" of me (i know the general term for what i experience is structural dissociation, i just don't know where exactly i am on that spectrum) and the fictional characters.

i don't know if it'd count as psychosis, although it definitely feels like it a lot of the time. i experience brief psychotic episodes sometimes and it's closer to that than intrusive thoughts or something. but because it started as maladaptive daydreaming, wouldn't it make sense for it to just be a very extreme (and weird) form of dissociation? especially considering all of the other symptoms i have?

even if it was either of those, it's not like i'd be able to find a whole lot of people who relate to my specific experience. people who maladaptive daydream don't really relate because what i experience is way more intense. it's ruining my life, nothing has been helpful, and i can't find anyone who experiences the same thing. what am i even supposed to do in this situation?",General_disorder

"doesn't matter how high or low the dose is, the longer i'm on them, the worse i feel. i've been on celexa, zoloft, prozac, effexor, and cymbalta, and wellbutrin. everything but the wellbutrin made me psychotic to some extent and all of them made me feel significantly worse in general.

i know meds won't fix everything, i just want something to help at least a little bit. i've taken vyvanse for my adhd and it helped a bit but i had to stop taking it because of how bad it made my anxiety.

"I am going to see my doctor today following the results of a blood test. I haven't been there for a long time (more than 2 years, I go there as little as possible and I'm rarely sick, it's bad luck this time)
I want to tell him everything. I'm scared because I don't know what his reaction will be, I don't like this person too much tho lol.

To sum up my situation, I am someone who has always felt bad about myself. I started very young to fall into bulimia, I made myself vomit the first time around 13 years old. Then my adolescence was chaotic, I started to mutilate myself at 15 and still today, 10 years later, I still have the same demons. Absolutely no one is aware, my mother was but she is no longer in this world. It's since I lost her that I started hurting myself again and right now I'm really not well, I have suicidal thoughts and I'm permanently anxious and sad. In short, it starts to become unbearable.

If you recognize yourself in this, I have a few questions: Is your doctor aware of your self harm? If so, how do I broach the subject without him thinking I'm crazy? I can always hide it but I don't know, lately I feel the need to talk. I'm really not well and it worries me maybe a little more than I would like. I guess he's going to send me to a therapist?

"I started therapy yesterday. I am 17. I had to sneak behind my parents back to do that. I don't know they would react if I tell them. Their reaction would be calling me 'crazy' and themselves unlucky for having a sick child.

After my first session yesterday, I have been unable to stop thinking about all the things that's wrong with me, all the things I want to do away with. It's soon for the therapist to diagnose but I need an answer. Help me here I am sorry.

I have been making lists for 5 hours, writing down in my journal about every incident and everything. I don't have the energy to post pictures of my journal here. Here's a brief list I am sorry this is so fucked up and needy and victimlike

1. Hyperfixating over things like they are only thing that matter one at a time for weeks and then I can't care any less. Currently fixating over ""everythings thats wrong with me""

2. Sensitive. Extremely. Easily hurt, disturbed, annoyed. Immediately breaks down.

3. Feeling unreal, dissoasicated with reality, like I don't exist even physically

4. I don't recognise myself most days. Some days I just exude confidence, lead teams, head events other days the slighest sound disturbs me. I flinch if I a outsife but other days I am the msot social person literally- at first kids think of me as the most extroverted person, then I just draw back on some days and my body jerks and I stay quiet. 

5. Can't stop blabbering. On both the highs and lows. I am so overwhelmed I can't shutmyself up.  I even cut people off. I just can't stop this. It's not in my country.

6. Needy, attachment issues, failed romantic relationships. I ruin them. I feel I am overly invested and that my partner isn't really into me. I constantly make my partner feel unheard, suffocated, overwhelmed.

7. Feeling alone and disconnected with anyone, even in the presence of my loved ones. 

8. Really really hate and resent and abhor my father. Living through 17 years of sheer trauma due to his emotional and mental abuse and yelling everyday for no reason

9. Afraid I am exactly like my father. the therapist yesterday traced everything back to him too. I don't wanna be anything like him but guess what J am exactly like him. This fear made me seek therapy.

10. Hypersexual episodes. This is shameful to even speak of but I am gonna let it out. Some days I have constant urges to masturbate and have cam sex with random old people online. I spent the whole day doing that. 

11. Unhealthy sexual fantasies. Involving derogatory and submissive encounters. Into mature and older men.

12. Sexually abused as a kid by an old guy. Never did anything about it. No one knows. 

13. Can't remember memories. Only traumatic childhood memories in my head. Which I can box into 3 places- 1. Abusive father 2. Sexual abuse 3. Bullied over gender
My therapist told me yesterday its my mind's defense mechanism. 

14. Bullied over gender and heard crude remarks for being a tomboy. People say I should ignore those things but I am unable to.

15. Can't stick to one thing. Moving and jumping one to another. 

16. Weeks of highs and lows

17. Extreme mood swings

18. Abandonment issues, afraid of being abandoned. 

19. Nothing seems real. Eg, it never seemed possible to me that a friend or a partner would never talk to me again

20. Unaware of what I am feeling, why I am feeling. I breakdown for no reason

21. Never content or satisfied. NEVER

22. Runs away from social situation, other times brings life to them

23. Something of a reverse pedophile. I am into older men. I was 13 and had a fling with a 19 year old guy.

24. I can remember being 11 and thinking about having sex with ALL of my teachers. (both male and female) (i identify as bisexual now but it is probably a result of my fucked up sexual inclinations) . I don't visualise that anymore for every person I meet. But for the first years of my adolescense, I really really did. 

25. Anxiety attacks.

I need an answer. I need to know how I can fix this. I can't go on living like this. It's very very troubling. I don't wanna be seen in a different way by people , I don't want their pity. I want to be normal. For the longest time I have thought that all this was normal. I still think a lot of these things are normal? Are they in my control? Am I making an excuse? I am making excuses right? Please tell me I am not. I can't do this. I want to know how to be normal and okay and just be satisfied. Do I have bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder or adhd? Am I mentally sick? Or am I just lazy and shitty? I don't wanna be any of these. I don't wana be sick and looked down upon and be seen as abnormal. I don't wanna be lazy I am not I am a straight A's student and I workout everyday and I volunteer.

i have these two characters in my head. i can tell them apart whenever one character acts out or starts speaking. letâ€™s call them sara and raven. theyâ€™re different ages, different personalities but they are part of me that makes me the way i am. sara and raven only come out and only talk to me when something traumatic happens to me. i was always a kid who kept to myself. never really had friends and always resorted to talking to myself as full blown conversations. now i have these two people that talk to me and give me advice whenever something traumatic happens. 

sara is more of  the inner child in me. She has no exact age but is around the age of 5-11. a lot of anger stemming from sara is because of my child neglect and trauma. sheâ€™s very angry and protective over me and canâ€™t let go of what happened in the past. 

raven is 17 year old me going into women hood. sheâ€™s very strong and such a badass and the she is the reason why iâ€™d ever put myself out there. â€œstop being such a pussy and go out and do what you need to doâ€ is something raven would say. 
when i talk to these characters i can imagine how they look and i talk aloud to them and they talk aloud to me.

sara is the mother figure I never had. The mother figure I always wanted. She tells me the truth on things that i donâ€™t want to face. She helps me put my foot down and stand strong on decisions. She hurts my feelings at times, telling me things I know I wouldnâ€™t love hearing. Whenever Iâ€™m in denial she helps me face the truth and get over it. sara is more of the mean bossy one but sheâ€™s very helpful in times of need because I know i am not that strong myself. i have mommy issuesâ€¦

"My boyfriend (25M) and I (21F) have been dating for 4 months now, and I know itâ€™s crazy but I genuinely picture my future with him. Weâ€™ve been planning to move together in two months to a new city and pursue careers together. Everything between us has been perfect, and any issue weâ€™ve had has been resolved in a healthy manner. We have great communication, we have the same life values and picture the same future and we want the same things. 

There have been a few occasions, and maybe even some red flags, that I swept under the rug. About a month into the relationship he told me he had some trust issues, and that there have been times in his life that he has felt like heâ€™s been investigated or recruited for an organization (the CIA, the FBI, something like that), and that he was suspicious I was sent to test him in some way. We talked through this and I promised him that it wasnâ€™t the case, and sometimes he still gets suspicious but he handles it better.

He told me about this theory that there is an organization of sorts that is structured like a cult, and they believe that the â€œonly way one can be worthy of meeting god is by withstanding the feats of the devilâ€ (something along those lines). He proceeded to tell me that in this theory I am the devil, and I have been sent to break his will and wear him down. 

We took a nap after this exchange, and I did suggest that he could seek professional help without calling him crazy. When we woke up he received bad news from his job, and he completely snapped on me. He had never talked to me the way he did. He told me to just â€œtell him the truthâ€, to â€œstop manipulating him,â€ that whatever I had to offer he wouldnâ€™t take it, and that I needed to â€œstop gaslighting himâ€. 

I immediately recognized that this was beyond a normal level of paranoia, and he is in the exact age range to start showing episodes of schizophrenia. He doesnâ€™t know it, and I donâ€™t know how to tell him.

I really donâ€™t want to but every body Iâ€™ve talked to about it (my family and close friends) encourage me to. The thought LITERALLY breaks my heart. I love him so so much. 

How do I tell him what I suspect is happening to him? I feel so so sorry for him because this is something that he will likely struggle with for the rest of his life. This type of illness puts people on the streets and causes them to take their own lives. I donâ€™t want to sound like Iâ€™m jumping to conclusions, but Iâ€™m having a hard time coming up with any other explanation.

No matter what, the future that I pictured for us isnâ€™t real anymore, and canâ€™t be the same.

"My boyfriend (25M) and I (21F) have been dating for 4 months now, and I know itâ€™s crazy but I genuinely picture my future with him. Weâ€™ve been planning to move together in two months to a new city and pursue careers together. Everything between us has been perfect, and any issue weâ€™ve had has been resolved in a healthy manner. We have great communication, we have the same life values and picture the same future and we want the same things. 

There have been a few occasions, and maybe even some red flags, that I swept under the rug. About a month into the relationship he told me he had some trust issues, and that there have been times in his life that he has felt like heâ€™s been investigated or recruited for an organization (the CIA, the FBI, something like that), and that he was suspicious I was sent to test him in some way. We talked through this and I promised him that it wasnâ€™t the case, and sometimes he still gets suspicious but he handles it better.

Iâ€™m just ranting here and hoping to see other peopleâ€™s opinion of it. I hope I donâ€™t offend anyone with what Iâ€™m about to say. In the past few months Iâ€™ve been using the idea of reincarnation as a coping mechanism. I donâ€™t like my life right now itâ€™s hella shitty so thinking that this life is just temporary and Iâ€™ll be somebody else in my next life (worse or better) calms me down also I have anxiety disorder. It makes me not take this life too seriously. It also makes me think in a third perspective where Iâ€™m just a character in a movie.

"I really don't know what's going on lately. I'm 13 and an only child with a pretty distant relationships with my parents. And I really don't want what I'm about to share to influence anyone. Things are starting feel more hopeless than they ever have lmao. I am diagnosed with general and social anxiety disorder as well as an eating disorder. It seems I struggle with really bad identity disturbance and have undiagnosed depression as those two things are not diagnosed where I go for appointments. I've had active contact with psychologist and had counselling for about two years now, and it seems whenever one thing starts getting better, I ruin it for myself. I had my first attempt that needed medical intervention in January and it was the first time I ever needed to talk with my parents about suicidal thoughts as all they really knew of was poor socialising and my eating disorder. Even after my psychiatric check up, when I was convinced it wasn't worth trying to do what I did again. I perhaps had some of the worst intrusive thoughts. I was actively trying to attempt every single day by doing things that I knew wouldn't beed immediate medical intervention. After several months of staying clean of self induced injuries, I relapsed. After months of having not caused self induced vomiting, I had the worst purging experience I'd had in a while. Nothing seems worth it. I don't even know who I am and had some of the worst episodes of de realisation last month. I have the lowest attendance out of everyone I know and I haven't been to school in over 3 weeks and on top of that I don't make plans with any of my friends. Even when I make the effort to dress up and ask someone if they wanna do something, it never goes to plan. Either the person I ask is always busy or I start to freak out really bad when I look at myself in the mirror. I made the effort to shower and go to an appointment for once after having been unable to bring myself to go outside after 2 or 3 weeks, just for the appointment to be cancelled because my psychologist, quote said ""it's too early for ___"". Like she expected for me to sleep through it or wanna cancel it myself. It really crushed me cause it felt as if the person I'm supposed to talk to about how I'm feeling doubted I'd even bother to wake up on time when I actually did manage to go. I cried alone when I got home and was really bitchy to my mom the rest of the day. I avoided talking to her on the way home and the gloomy weather didn't help. Everyday feels like it's getting worse. I look back at myself every month like wow I was much happier 3 months ago than I was now but me those 3 months ago told myself I was so much happier the 3 months before that. I'm just so upset. I'm always so mad at everyone and in bed trying to distract myself from everything. On top of that I have constant thoughts about food and my body. I'm really holding onto my eating disorder and things like music. People tell me I'd be so much happier if I chose to recover from my bulimia or commit to recovering from self induced injuries, but I ignore it every time. As much as I hate having an eating disorder, it feels as if there is nothing else in life keeping me occupied. If I'm not thinking about food or anything self destructive, I'm just in my room thinking which ultimately leads to really intrusive thoughts. It's an endless cycle I have no control over, but I refuse to tell anyone about it because I'm convinced no one cares and that even if I asked for help: it'd do me more harm. I want my social life back. Just one day where I can get through something without feeling bothered by it. Talking to people, not being so distant and moody around my parents and making the effort to make hygienic and healthy choices. A day where anything good that happens isn't immediately interrupted by the fact that I always allow myself to overthink until it's too late to distract myself and I do something stupid.",General_disorder

"i already have so many other issues but this thing in particular has been affecting me more and more lately and i don't know what the hell is going on because not a single damn person understands or has been helpful. none of the mental health professionals i've talked to have even remotely understood either so please for the love of god don't tell me to talk to someone, i literally have been since i was 12. i really am sorry that i keep talking about this but i don't know what to do. literally everyone just tells me to talk to a professional no matter how many times i say that i have, i've probably talked to 15+ of them over the years and have been on 9 different medications so far and i keep getting worse overall. i have bpd, cptsd, ocd, adhd, autism, and probably have some sort of dissociative disorder for reasons unrelated to what i explained below, although that could definitely be part of it.

i started maladaptive daydreaming constantly when i was around 6, maybe even younger, due to an extremely traumatic childhood. when i was around 12, i started to lose control over the characters and it's just gotten worse since then.

i constantly feel like i'm being watched and like the characters can read all of my thoughts. when i say constantly, i mean CONSTANTLY. it sometimes makes it extremely difficult to do basic tasks because i feel like i'm being watched. sometimes it's difficult to do something because i cannot convince myself i'm in this reality and not in theirs, so instead of doing what i'm trying to do, i feel like i'm actually doing something i'm not supposed to in their world. i will end up sitting on the floor crying, hitting my head, and scratching myself telling them to go away, which never gets them to go away.

the characters usually don't say anything, and the fictional characters specifically never take control of me (i have ""parts"" of myself that might but i don't think the fictional characters are the same as them considering how easily they enter my mind and, again, they don't take control of me or anything like that). when they do, it's only in my head and only ever when i need someone to comfort me, although i don't have any control over who is there and what they say.

i don't have control over the characters that are currently present. i still daydream very frequently, but i can usually only imagine scenarios involving whoever is in my head at the time because otherwise it feels weird and not nearly as real. certain characters can temporarily ""invade"" my mind if i even just see them on TV for a second, no matter how much i like or dislike the character(s). even just thinking about them can cause this and i fucking hate it. sometimes i can't watch shows i want to because of how intensely characters i don't want in my head might enter it.

it's gotten to the point where i keep almost saying things out loud in public or mouthing the words. it's hard to just fucking WALK now because it's so bad. it used to be a bit better around other people but not anymore.

the characters feel so real in my head and i really just don't understand what the fuck is going on with me, and clearly no one else does either. i know i'm extremely dissociative in general and have a very overactive imagination so it might just be those two things together, but that doesn't exactly tell me how to fix it. maybe i'm psychotic, i don't fucking know. i know how stupid all of this sounds but it's destroying my life and i don't know what the hell i'm supposed to do about it when no one understands. everyone either thinks i'm exaggerating (which i'm fucking not, i wish i was), attention seeking (again, i am fucking not), does not understand what i'm saying, or finds it very interesting but can't do anything about it. literally all i want is a solution or some advice but no one has been able to help. the ""professionals"" who are supposed to help with things like this have not been able to help.",General_disorder

"I think I had a mental breakdown the other day? Iâ€™m very worried itâ€™s going to happen again. I can sense that itâ€™s going to happen again and it stresses me out. 

What happened: 

I found out my bloodwork got cancelled and I couldnâ€™t find something important that I lost. This caused my gender dysphoria to flare up and caused an anxiety attack (heart racing, couldnâ€™t breath, racing thoughts, etc.). Which then quickly became an uncontrollable fit of rage. Iâ€™m usually very good at keeping this in and just using sh to get rid of these emotions so this was surprising. During this fit of rage I started smashing ceramic pieces that gave me gender dysphoria and reminded me of my past. 

I have many episodes of anger where I want to destroy everything from my past. I throw things out, I break things, I burn stuff. Itâ€™s a common occurrence, but never has one been this out of control. They are always uncontrollable but this one was more extreme than the others. 

Anyways, the ceramic pieces got everywhere on the floor and my dog was in the room. So my sibling started freaking out and picking them up. I wasnâ€™t really in control of myself but I started helping because I didnâ€™t want my dog to get hurt. Though, I loudly exclaimed that it wasnâ€™t sharp as I picked up the pieces (I donâ€™t know why I thought they wouldnâ€™t be sharp). To â€œproveâ€ this I roughly grabbed one of the pieces and squeezed it in my hand. I didnâ€™t hesitate doing this and had no control what I was doing. It just happened so fast I didnâ€™t even think about what I was doing. The piece obviously was sharp and cut my finger fairly deep. I stared in shock as blood dripped down my hand. 

I paid the injury no mind and continued freaking out. I was pacing around the house and panting (I couldnâ€™t really breath). I then went outside and smashed a ceramic piece I made. After cleaning it up I went inside and ripped all the drawings out of a sketchbook with the intentions of burning it. The episode ended before I could and I suddenly just felt fine, empty even. So I went and watched YouTube for hours. At around three am I randomly fell into a depressive spiral and ended up cutting (I do this often). Then I was fine and went to sleep. 

Is this normal? What do I do to stop another one? I feel it coming. Like Iâ€™m on the edge and Iâ€™m about to fall. If you read all that, thank you.",General_disorder

I recently filed for a protection order against my ex who was stalking, harassing and making threats against me and my family.

I just wanted to see if anyone can help me figure out what is causing these symptoms. 

Anyways, I often get this very strong urge to cut everyone off and never talk to them again. Itâ€™s not only because being around people overwhelms me but because I donâ€™t want to deal with the pain for when they leave me. I know eventually everyone will leave, whether it be death or because they donâ€™t love me anymore. I just donâ€™t want to deal with that. With online friends I lose motivation as well to talk to them. As a result I donâ€™t have online friends anymore though this may be caused by depression.

I feel incredibly disconnected from my past. Like I canâ€™t believe it real. This may be because my past was traumatic but even the good stuff doesnâ€™t feel like it actually happened. Like I know the past was real and happened but I just feel so disconnected from it most of the time. 

I get extreme jealousy with my two friends. I never tell them or take it out on them but itâ€™s always there. Itâ€™s super annoying and upsetting. Iâ€™m paranoid they will both find other friends and leave me behind. I unconsciously view their friends as threats and hate their friends because of it. This jealousy often leads to thinking very rude thoughts about said friends. Like about how I hate them or that I donâ€™t care if I never see them again. 

Iâ€™m incredibly clingy but I never show it. Sometimes I want to be alone so I leave but if either of my fps do the same I get upset. I want them to hang out with me 24/7 unless Iâ€™m the one who wants to be alone. I get very paranoid thoughts when they leave me alone. I canâ€™t go anywhere without at least one of them with me (mostly anxiety I think). 

Are these normal? If not what causes this? Itâ€™s quite distressing sometimes and I feel like a shit person because of my jealousy. I donâ€™t take any of these symptoms on anyone, I just keep it to myself. I still feel bad about feeling this way at all though.",General_disorder

The best of everything, even if i canâ€™t really afford it. I think itâ€™ll fix my life, and it never does. I recently bought a bag that I really canâ€™t afford. I canâ€™t even bear to look at it. Itâ€™s been sitting in my closet for weeks, it makes me feel so guilty. Iâ€™ve been extremely irritable. Snapping at coworkers, customers, and basically anyone. I broke up with my ex boyfriend a few months back and he was very cruel, yelled at me and insulted me a lot, judgmental. Heâ€™d black out in anger and not remember what he said the day after. It was lonely. I didnâ€™t stand up for myself. I would trip on my words if I tried and mostly my mind would go blank, maybe out of surprise, or fear. I donâ€™t know. I regret it. Now when someone speaks to me in any tone I donâ€™t like I feel defensive, I need to prove that I can stand up for myself now, you canâ€™t mess with me anymore, even when the persons intentions were totally innocent. I can be incredibly nasty and always feel regretful afterwards but in the moment my anger is so hot and beyond my control. It scares me. He had a lot of the same impulsivity problems I now have. Itâ€™s weird to think that I am almost turning into him. I want to date again (almost to prove that it wonâ€™t fail like it did last time) but itâ€™s hard. Iâ€™m insecure and have a lot of issues. I also get attached early on. When itâ€™s someone I like and think I know I just want to skip everything and get straight into a relationship. Itâ€™s all very bizarre. But the most disturbing symptom of all has been my eating habits. I eat like crazy. I never have in my life eaten this much. Iâ€™ve gained like 10 pounds in a month. And I inhale my food. Something I donâ€™t even think I chew it. I eat when Iâ€™m not hungry. I eat when Iâ€™m bored. I eat and i donâ€™t even realize Iâ€™m eating. I eat portions I used to consider entire meals several times a day. I eat like Iâ€™m in a hot dog race, or like the food is gonna run away from my plate. I canâ€™t stand to look at myself. I feel lethargic. I canâ€™t control myself. I realized I had it and started going to the gym again, and with the same ferocity started working out. Running miles on the treadmill. Restricting food so much. I was hurting the shit out of my back and knees but couldnâ€™t stop, again, with the ferocity Iâ€™ve described. I didnâ€™t get results in a week so I quit. Iâ€™m back eating even more than I did before. Iâ€™m so scared. I need help, but when I actually have a therapist I get so shy and reserved, unable to talk about my real issues. Plus, I think I need something more intensive than a typical cbt therapist. Iâ€™m confused and worried. I have no idea what is happening but I needed to get it off my chest",General_disorder
Today I tried to hang myself. But while I was dangling and losing breath something told me to keep fighting. Iâ€™m here to say it may be hard trust me I know but even though I donâ€™t know who will see this..keep fighting I believe in you I care for you. Keep fightingðŸ™ðŸ¾,General_disorder
"Iâ€™m not sure how to describe this but Iâ€™ll give an example. 

So my current partner was fantasizing about another person in front of me and my brain still has the full image of what she looked like. Literally cemented in my head. Itâ€™s been like 8 months?
(Not that this mattered nor did I say anything cuz I know Iâ€™m mentally ill) 

Now another example: A few days ago, I saw on my partnerâ€™s phone that someone accepted their follow request on IG and my brain took a photo of it. Iâ€™ll try my best to talk myself down and tell myself that itâ€™s nothing but itâ€™s so hard to not wonder why my brain took a photo? Does it mean something? Why would it do that? Then what happens is I begin to hyperfixate on the photo. It has to be stuck in my head for a reason? 

Then pretty soon iâ€™m spiraling with crazy rapid thoughts and asking to check my partners phone. Itâ€™s not okay for me to do, I understand. Which itâ€™s so hard to explain that itâ€™s not that i donâ€™t not trust them itâ€™s just my brain literally is fucking mentally ill. So I donâ€™t explain it because even then itâ€™s not an excuse. 

How do I make it stop? Itâ€™s so mentally exhausting.",General_disorder
Itâ€™s a struggle to make it to the end of every day and not end it. I try so very hard specifically for my partner but idk how much longer ima be able to keep going. I do have a good connection with my family and I know this is toxic but mentally Iâ€™ve cut myself off from them because I just want to be able to go without worrying about them. Typing this out I know how selfish this is I just cant do it anymore. I love them but itâ€™s so hard to go through the day and see how easily I can end it all. For now another day will go by but I truly wonder how long until the day I canâ€™t take the suffering anymore comes.,General_disorder
"ok so to start, iâ€™m diagnosed with Major depressive disorder with psychotic tendencies, i was previously diagnosed with bipolar 1, because i tried to commit suicide and failed, and after i was baker acted i became sort of manic.  So basically my psychotic tendencies are that i develop a thought and it becomes obsessive.  This comes from major self esteem issues due to bullying.  thats what my psychiatrist said.
So once i started dating my girlfriend i started to have thoughts about my sexuality.  It began after a nap, i woke up and thought what if i was gay.  It wouldnâ€™t leave my mind.  It really made me question my relationship.  this lasted for about 3 months. (feel free to leave opinions about this, Iâ€™m open to anything, i just donâ€™t plan on exploring sexually, maybe in the future).  thats one of the thoughts, i also am extremely insecure around people and am always wondering if iâ€™m being to weird or quiet.
Now onto my girlfriend.  I started questioning if i really liked her. This started because id see other women and think they are attractive and i watch porn sometimes so id feel guilty.  Id think because i thought other women were hot, then i donâ€™t like my girlfriend.  Then i started feeling bad every time we had sex, id think that i only wanted to be with her for sex.  Sex is amazing  with her tho.  and recently i started to feel odd around her.  Like i didnâ€™t have feelings for her.  But i want to live my life with her, i want her to have mu kids and move in with her.  I love buying her things and love everything she buys me.  Sometimes the thought of her having my kids makes me feel better.  so i donâ€™t know why i feel so weird around her now
Also before this, i was  over thinking if she liked me and i kept thinking she was going to leave me.

What u guys think about this, did i fall out of love with my girlfriend, whats wrong with me?",General_disorder

"Iâ€™ve actually thought about this for a long time. I have this desire to vanish: full deal- missing posters, full scale searches turning up nothing, nobody ever finding out where I am. Iâ€™ve thought about ditching my identity and starting a new one- it feels like my past follows me wherever I go. What makes this even stranger is Iâ€™ve even wanted to get kidnapped (no this isnâ€™t a fetish) and have taken measures for it to happen. It seems wether it be volunteerly disappearing or getting kidnapped if the end result is nobody hearing from me again, Iâ€™d be fine with it. Im not suicidal, iâ€™m not even depressed- in fact Im quite happy. I believe it could be tied to my extreme lack of control during my childhood (I was mentally tortured numerous times levels of no control).

"So Iâ€™ve been recently doing a lot of research into ASPD and specifically sociopathy, cause if I had psychopathy I wouldâ€™ve been able to tell up until now (recently 17 btw). I show literally all of the symptoms to some degree. Iâ€™m going to see a doctor soon and have him ring up a psyche. I already have been diagnosed with ADHD and Autism, and show symptoms of OCD and Bipolar as do my parents.

Im not asking for thoughts on if I have it or not, but as it stands I am showing lots of symptoms and for me itâ€™s looking likely. What Iâ€™m worried about is how Iâ€™m gonna cope with it. I was able to cope fine with learning about my ADHD and Autism, but something about this scares me. The label â€œsociopathâ€ has so much stigma and Iâ€™m scared it will scare away people I know.

I donâ€™t want to hurt people or manipulate them, so I think if Iâ€™d get diagnosed I would be constantly be stressing about the things I say, like I would be talking to my friend like and I think to myself â€œdid I just accidentally manipulate her subconsciously?â€ and be second guessing every action I take as subconscious manipulation. I also want to feel love for my gf, but I canâ€™t. Itâ€™s not there. In all honesty I donâ€™t know what it feels like and if I have sociopathy thereâ€™s a chance I wonâ€™t ever know, and that frightens me so much, cause intimacy is one of the most important things in my life and not being to feel love really strikes my heart.

And last of all, I already feel like an outcast but another, more uncommon and more â€œscarierâ€ disorder added to my list will make me feel more alien. I already feel like no one gets me, even remotely. I want to feel like everyone else. Right now Iâ€™m waiting to see him in the oncoming weeks, and Itâ€™s nerve wrecking to say the least.",General_disorder

"Iâ€™m making this clear right off the bat that I am not looking for anybody to diagnose me nor am I self diagnosing. I just need to vent. 

So I have had an obsession with psych since I was 14. Iâ€™m 23 now. Iâ€™ve spent the last 9 years reading and reading and buying all of the psych books you can imagine. Combing through the DSM and case study books. Fuck, I read case studies online when Iâ€™m bored. I know what certain things can look like. 

Iâ€™ve gone through cycles where theyâ€™ve told me I have mdd, anxiety, ptsd, adhd blah blah blah. The whole 9 yards. 

This last year has been nuts. Donâ€™t sleep a lot for weeks or months at a time, binge drinking during this time, I donâ€™t want to say Iâ€™m having risky sex because it was with one person but I wanted to have sex all the time. Iâ€™ve always had a problem with spending. Feeling on top of the world but not completely grandiose. 

Now, the last 2 months I feel crazy. Canâ€™t focus, *extreme* mood swings throughout the day. One moment I want to die the next Iâ€™m happy as can be. Angry. Anxious. Itâ€™s so stupid. My thoughts are constantly bouncing from one to another. Theyâ€™re moving so fast now that Iâ€™ll literally go to do something and another thought interrupts  that and Im at a loss and forgery what Iâ€™m doing. 

Iâ€™m averaging about 3-5 hours of sleep a day and staying up later and later and later every night and Iâ€™m just not tired. My wife says that sheâ€™s seen every emotion imaginable in me today. Bitchy, happy, sad and probably more. 

Like, I KNOW this is not okay lol. I know itâ€™s not but I canâ€™t just show up to the doctor and be like heyyyyyyyyyy Iâ€™m here and Iâ€™ve suddenly got all this shit going on.

I have ADHD. Am 19 years old. And Iâ€™ve been having the issue where I ruminate about my past mistakes/actions and about bad things Iâ€™ve done in the past in a loop.

"Hello guys,
I'm really concerned about my sister lately. She is going to be 15 in some weeks and lives with our parents. I'm 32 and live far away, I'm only able to visit my family on vacations or holidays. 
My sister has always been difficult to handle. She has been born over a month too early and was really underweight at birth. As a baby and toddler she screamed until she was hoarse. Only our mom was able to calm her down a little. She threw temper tantrums very often, beat us, it was horrible tbh. Often her tantrums started because she didn't get what she wanted but at the end, our mother always gave in and so ""she won"". My mother has a really bad chronic disease and I kind of understand that she just wanted to end the trouble with giving in, but I think it was just bad parenting. 
On my last visit, she ruined my birthday. When I criticized her for being late so our plan on how to get to the restaurant had to be changed, she just went away angrily and appeared later out of nowhere to the restaurant and was in bad mood, talking to no one, sulking. I confronted her that this behaviour was unfair but she just walked out of the restaurant and never came back. After that incident, I still helped her with her homework etc. but she was overall so cold and distant to everyone and disinterested in doing sth. together. On my last day, I got into an argument with her, I told her in a harsh tone that I didn't get what her problem was and if she was autistic, so that she wouldn't understand. I know it was kinda insulting and not correct, but her condescending attitude made me mad. Then she ran away and only returned in the evening, when I was long gone.
After more than a month now I wanted to visit my family again and my mother told me that my sister is still furious about me and my mother tried to mediate between us. My sister declined. Then suddenly she called me and told me that I mustn't come because I insulted her as an autist and she doesn't want to see me. I told her that she can't keep me away from my own family which she answered that she doesn't consider me as her family anymore and that because of my job in a social field I would have reacted unprofessional and should have known better. When I told her that she can't see her own portions why I reacted that way she told me that I would have provoked her by criticizing her on my birthday. 

I later tried to call my parents again when our father told me that after I told my sister that regardless of what she demands I will come to visit my parents this weekend, she had has kind of a mental breakdown, lying down on the floor and getting kind of seizures. She demanded an ambulance. My father then ended the call, he was concerned and worn out. He told me later that she had 270 (!) blood pressure and the doctor took her to the hospital, but they brought her back later because she threw a tantrum there as well and even tried to attack the staff.
I don't know what to think anymore. Since she was a baby I've tried my best to build a connection with her in watching anime, going out into nature, helping her with school and friends and even took her on a trip abroad just to be dismissed because I said sth. she disliked once. Normally I think, two siblings would talk things out and that both of them would want to protect their relationship, making compromises etc. But for her it has always been a hit or miss and she has forced to win arguments with family members no matter what.

Any ideas what mental condition my sister might suffer from? Is this autistic behaviour? Or is she a psychopath? How is she able to be so aggressive with her family but so shy and anxious towards others (but apparently not with medical staff)?
What should we do?",General_disorder
"Every time I cry or feel stressed out, I take it on myself by hitting myself. And I hate how it makes me feel so much better because it makes me want to just cry more or be angry towards something just so I could have a reason to hit myself.

And Iâ€™ve been obsessive with trying to give myself bruises and when I actually see it, I deeply regret it and wish I never did it.",General_disorder
"My mother (who has Bipolar and depression) has treated me like poorly. She would call me names (bitch,dumbass, etc.) On a daily basis, get mad a me for doing nothing wrong, and in generally made feel unwanted. She would always put her problems above everybody else's. She never cared about anybody else's mental health or how her bad moods made others feel. If me or anybody else tries to say something to her she will instantly start victimizing herself. If I get moody with her even a bit she will either lash out at me or she will continue to bring it up for days and victimize herself again. Then she just vent and trauma dump to me continuously. She won't even ask she just sit down stay silent for a minute then start venting and whatnot.

"Her psychiatrist started for some reason to take her off of a couple of her meds that she used for sleep. Sleep suffered and she was then in a manic state I encouraged her to take what meds she did have and get some sleep and make an appointment with her dr. She made an appointment dr was on vacation so it would be a week or so.  She skips her appointment said she forgot but she in psychosis. I started making her take her meds and make another appointment and set up her dad to take her to the Dr. She gets there refused to go in so he takes her to the er then calls the cops to put her in involuntarily.  She gets moved to an out of town facility 2 hours there 2 hours back, I bring her what I'm allowed to and call her on the phone.  I want her out to see a local dr that she can see continuously to get help, her dad want her to stay there until she's ""better"". I've contacted a lawyer to set up a consultation in doing everything I can think of to help.  She does need some kind of help it was bad enough to take guns out and arranged for childcare and was constantly worried about what she was doing by her self cause she was sending text about portals and flying cats.  She's been in there a few days today's the first visitation day she angry at me for not coming to get her she thinks she can leave, I've called the facility they said they're not sure why she thinks they, and when I called this morning to assure her I was coming to see her if she needed anything and I loved her went to like a voice mailbox.  I've been handling the weight place on my shoulders but this is out of my depth I naturally don't like doctors and are skeptical of them some just aren't very smart most others dont care/listen and that is just from me trying to get antibiotics for absess tooth that's visible and obvious. I just want to help her without being some dictator/ treating her like child.

"For background I guess, my half sister and half brother developed schizophrenia after our mom died. I was kicked out and stuck in abusive situations until generally recently. 

Because of this, I developed what I found on Google as a ""soulbound"" or ""tulpa"", basically someone in my daydreams kept talking to me, and is the only nice influence in my life. 

My sister thinks it's schizophrenia, but I'm afraid if I talk to a doctor about it they will go away and I will end up doing something violent because no one is telling me not to. 

What should I do about this? Does this sound like schizophrenia? How can I talk to a doctor about this without losing them since I really need them?",General_disorder

"i already have so many other issues but this thing in particular has been affecting me more and more lately and i don't know what the hell is going on because not a single damn person understands or has been helpful. i've made so many posts about this on my old account but i haven't really received any helpful advice or answers. none of the mental health professionals i've talked to have even remotely understood either so please for the love of god don't tell me to talk to someone, i literally have been since i was 12.

i started maladaptive daydreaming constantly when i was around 6, maybe even younger, due to an extremely traumatic childhood. when i was around 12, i started to lose control over the characters and it's just gotten worse since then.

i constantly feel like i'm being watched and like the characters can read all of my thoughts. when i say constantly, i mean CONSTANTLY. it sometimes makes it extremely difficult to do basic tasks because i feel like i'm being watched. sometimes it's difficult to do something because i cannot convince myself i'm in this reality and not in theirs, so instead of doing what i'm trying to do, i feel like i'm actually doing something i'm not supposed to in their world. i will end up sitting on the floor crying, hitting my head, and scratching myself telling them to go away, which never gets them to go away.

the characters usually don't say anything, and the fictional characters specifically never take control of me (i have ""parts"" of myself that might but i don't think the fictional characters are the same as them considering how easily they enter my mind and, again, they don't take control of me or anything like that). when they do, it's only in my head and only ever when i need someone to comfort me, although i don't have any control over who is there and what they say.

i don't have control over the characters that are currently present. i still daydream very frequently, but i can usually only imagine scenarios involving whoever is in my head at the time because otherwise it feels weird and not nearly as real. certain characters can temporarily ""invade"" my mind if i even just see them on TV for a second, no matter how much i like or dislike the character(s). even just thinking about them can cause this and i fucking hate it. sometimes i can't watch shows i want to because of how intensely characters i don't want in my head might enter it.

it's gotten to the point where i keep almost saying things out loud in public or mouthing the words. it's hard to just fucking WALK now because it's so bad. it used to be a bit better around other people but not anymore.

the characters feel so real in my head and i really just don't understand what the fuck is going on with me, and clearly no one else does either. i know i'm extremely dissociative in general and have a very overactive imagination so it might just be those two things together, but that doesn't exactly tell me how to fix it. maybe i'm psychotic, i don't fucking know. i know how stupid all of this sounds but it's destroying my life and i don't know what the hell i'm supposed to do about it when no one understands.",General_disorder

"I'm experiencing a collection of possible symptoms that don't really match anything I've found so far. Initially, I thought I was just ""slow"", but it actually has nothing to do with my processing speed; I do have a weird cognitive tempo thing going on, but this seems... Different. My friends with similar processing troubles can't relate to this. As far as I'm aware, I don't have an intellectual disability--in fact, people tell me I'm smart sometimes, and lots of them tell me the way I think is kind of cool. 

However, it impedes my day to day functioning to the point that I constantly feel confused and drained. 

It's difficult to describe, but it's like I think in metaphors. People often tell me the way I speak is confusing; it seems like my reasoning and speech is pretty convoluted and requires a lot of backtracking for context. Something will make perfect sense to me but seem disjointed and even detached to others. I will replace scenery, objects, and speech with random substitutions based on comparisons that appear to happen automatically (e.g., I'll see a power line over a street that reminds me of an arch or a doorway, and interpret the doorway as being ""there""; I'll see a yellow box cutter and substitute it for a large toothpick). It also seems like I derive connotations from words that aren't there or even make up new associations with them entirely, and so people tell me my descriptions of concepts, situations, or objects are abstract and confusing. The problem is, it's genuinely how I see the world-- it's a conscious effort to see what's right in front of me for what it is, to the point that I often cannot move, function, follow instructions, solve problems... Also, the explanations for things I come up with or the ways I approach problems or tasks often seems nonsensical or poorly planned from an external perspective. I will move out of the way of a hole I imagined in the air because someone used the phrase ""fell down a rabbit hole"". When I see an unfamiliar place or object, I misinterpret basic stuff, if that makes sense at all. I will also, on occasion, ""go blank""-- totally stiff, can't think, can't speak, someone has to physically move me to somewhere else so I can ride it out. Also, I will (often due to stress, sometimes unprompted) randomly become so confused and disoriented that I can't understand basic English, answer questions, and get really angry and frustrated and often even paranoid. 

All in all, it seems like I'm looking at some sort of really severe cognitive impairment. It's great for art and writing, but absolutely horrible for all other facets of existence. I often just cannot make any sense of my surroundings; it's not like I hallucinate, it's just that what's there becomes wildly different due to my way of perceiving.

Is there a name for this? Does it seem pathological or do I just need to, like, deal? Does anyone else experience this or find it relatable? The best answer I can find is the type/s of thought disorder seen on the schizophrenia spectrum, but I don't have (many) notable delusions* or hallucinations, and the cognitive stuff is the only thing that impedes my quality of life. In fact, I can't find much info that describes what I'm experiencing at all. 

To be clear, I am not looking for a diagnosis; I'll take that up with a professional, thank you very much. But it'd be useful to know if this is associated with any problem in particular so that I can address it, especially if it could be something I can fix through lifestyle changes.

* I do experience/have experienced paranoia, and I've had odd ideas/beliefs/superstitions before (such as people reading my mind through my ears), but I can recognise them pretty consistently as being unrealistic or silly and they don't really impede my functioning, unlike this way of thinking I've described.",General_disorder

You say a little prayer


God please donâ€™t wake me up


Then you stay up, an empty stare


Itâ€™s not wanting to get up


But you have to leave the bed


You literally want to sleep all day


But you go to work instead 


Itâ€™s not being able to focus


Itâ€™s taking meds to help you out


Itâ€™s zoning out while on the phone


Lump in your throat that wonâ€™t come out


It can make you feel so empty


And you know that you should eat


But instead you starve another day


Just calling it fasting, donâ€™t retreat 


Itâ€™s not taking a shower 


And you forget to brush your teeth


A week goes by and so you try


On the bathroom floor cause youâ€™re so weak


You want to make that phone call 


Reach out there to a friend


Instead you keep it all inside 


Youâ€™re a burden in the end 


Itâ€™s not seeing a future 


And obsessing with your past


You hope the voices settle 


But you know theyâ€™ll only last


Itâ€™s a fear of something you donâ€™t know


It is grief mixed with regret


It is never being good enough 


You are a goal thatâ€™s never met


Itâ€™s constantly berating yourself


You beat you up all day 


You point out flaws and claw at walls


And then â€œIâ€™m fineâ€ you say


Itâ€™s understanding darkness 


For you itâ€™s a way of life 


Itâ€™s never seeing brightness 


If you could only see the light 


Itâ€™s having to keep going 


Itâ€™s a misery but you move on


You do it for those that you love 


You know leaving them is wrong


Itâ€™s always finding chaos


In the little bits of peace 


Itâ€™s never being happy


Itâ€™s a pain you can not ease 


Itâ€™s dreaming of that one day 


But you never get it done


You say maybe tomorrow 


But tomorrow never comes


Itâ€™s thinking that youâ€™re crazy 


That nothing you do is right 


Wish mom had an abortion 


Shouldâ€™ve never had a life


Itâ€™s taking things for granted 


You really donâ€™t deserve it 


Itâ€™s doing for all around you


Leaves you lonely and deserted 


Itâ€™s having to shut up 


Because you know you said too much


You know youâ€™re hard to deal with 


You think theyâ€™ve had enough


So you fight to just be normal 


You do the things you have to do

The office always dimly lit

I try to answer honestly


As we try to find the cause


We go back to my childhood


Though I have no thoughts to share


I try to find a memory


But the memories arenâ€™t there


She said I have PTSD


From what, I do not know


That Iâ€™ve voided out the trauma


Suppressed thoughts, they save my soul


She takes notes on her inquiries

Asking the same questions

Iâ€™ve told her of my cleaning


While Iâ€™m up so late at night


Insomnia consumes me


I donâ€™t help, keep on the lights

Then sleep eighteen hours straight


Keeping myself busy


Long for sleep, just wait and wait


Donâ€™t tell her of my drinking


â€™Cause the pills donâ€™t seem to help

Try to take care of myself


I donâ€™t think too much of it


The late nights and long days


She drops her glasses lower


Looks at me as if Iâ€™m crazed


Canâ€™t say I want it all to end


Just tell her Iâ€™m exhausted


I keep a straight face briefly


Then start crying, then I lost it


Grab a tissue from the box


Canâ€™t explain my emotion


Wish I didnâ€™t know how to swim


I would just jump into the ocean


She tries to calm me down


Then changes my diagnosis

Not the best prognosis

Nor will I let it beat me

My concern as of now is what specific condition I'm struggling with.

"I dont even know where to start.

I just noticed that sometimes when loved ones of mine get hurt or cry, i just randomly smile? Like mostly for my baby sister, she's 3 turning 4. Well being...well a baby she cries a lot, the most recent one was hours ago when she didnt want me to bath her, she wanted our mom but she was busy. She started crying loudly and i held her hand and just smiled then chuckled. I was annoyed and even had the urge to hit her, but of course, no. I just smiled while holding her hand tight. She was trying so hard to pull away and i just released my grip and she fell and she cried louder, my smile grew bigger.

My mom saw the whole scene and offered to just bath my sister, she looked horrified.

Anyways, this wasnt the only instance where this happened and there were other much worser cases.

"So Iâ€™ve been an A star student my entire life but when I entered college, I figured out that I daydream a lot in lectures and online classes especially when the teacherâ€™s way of explanation is boring and canâ€™t concentrate on a single word. My way of studying also changed that I have to say things out loud in order to memorize things unlike in school, I used to write the lessons several times to memorize them. I also get distracted easily either at school or at the house. I used to be so quite at school receiving praise from all the teachers but now I feel like I want to do anything except listening to lectures and I want my classmates to play anything with me but I feel that they are all really boring. I sigh a lot when I want the lecture to end. I canâ€™t wait for the exams to start in the exam hall. I just cannot believe I passed the first semester because that A star student became less than average. So I searched about my condition and I found out it could be ADD because of how easily distracted Iâ€™m but I can also relate to ADHD due to the fact that when I checked the symptoms I found out that I relate to some of them:
I overshare (which I struggle with everyday, counting the number of times I open up with people)
I have craving for certain things like certain types of yoghurt which motivate me before I study and I really chase motivation 
My room is messy
I forget peopleâ€™s names
I avoid eyecontacts
I interrupt people and switch topics where I can say different topics and forget about the first topic 
I no longer make schedules for my studyings because I always end up procrastinating due to the excessive daydreams and I always try to fit many tasks but I fail to finish them all. (Sometimes I only finish a single task out of 6 tasks)
I can study one day very effectively and then the other day I just donâ€™t want to study and I donâ€™t know the reason 
And other symptoms of course, but how could I have ADHD when most of these symptoms just appeared this year? How could someone develop a disorder after a certain age? Is that even possible?
Note: This year has been the toughest one ever because of many unpleasant events that happened in my life 
Do I have ADHD? My parents are still not hundred percent convinced because it just happened this year.",General_disorder

"so  i have had a boyfriend of two years online, we've never met but we have  spoken on the phone many times and im supposed to meet him next month.  so i loved and still love him a lot but i cheated on him a few times,  things haven't been official as to wether were dating but we act like a  romantic couple for the past two years so obviously we can say we've  been exclusive. i had sex with a guy in december and i told him about it  and didn't expect him to get this upset and he blocked me for a week,  after which i tried to get back with him and did. i started talking to a  new guy closeby a few weeks ago that i had a crush on in high school, i  started liking him and we sexted. i still was ''dating'' my boyfriend  but i wanted to keep them both at the same time out of convenience and  because i liked the different purposes they served and possibilities/new  excitement i guess. anyways, my boyfriend find out accidently that i  sexted with this guy and saw a screenshot of it, i basically gaslighted  him into thinking that he was wrong and lied that it was an old  screenshot just so i wouldn't lose him. i thought it was funny and  laughed when he found out about me cheating cause it was in the dumbest  way possible. anyways, it was very obvious he was heartbroken cause he  does truly love me. i didn't feel any remorse or guilt and wasn't  affected whatsoever, i just went on with my day. i was shocked at how  little i felt i guess after two years. i got him back now after kind of  crying which i kind of did so he could feel pity for me. i think there  is nothing wrong with me having cheated considering we live long  distance, i'm not sure if i would feel the same if he did it though. i  guess i don't view what i did as something bad as long as he didn't find  out about it. i mean a lot of people's morality is based on others  suffering = bad, if he doesn't find out he isn't suffering. i guess it  became bad once he did

the second  example was 2 days ago i was applying for a job as a flight attendant  and this girl came next to me crying about her dad cause she just came  out of the psychological evaluation and she said he died recently. i  tried to be empathatic i guess but i didn't know how to respond/didn't  feel any compassion but i knew i was supposed to since she was crying. i  said ''i'm sorry he died'' and then just returned back to whatever i  was doing. then i got into the psychological evaluation and the guy  asked me something that makes me sad, i told him the example of the girl  crying because i thought that would be something fitting to respond  with.

the third example is people  who talk about their feelings generally bother me, if my grandmother or  other immediate relatives is crying i would feel some compassion and ask  why they are crying but i guess with everyone else i don't?

i  guess i don't really care for people and lately it's becoming more  obvious, i've been called selfish cause i try to let other people do  things for me as much as possible but it's not like i'm super mean about  it i guess. like i don't intentionally hurt people, i just don't feel  anything. i don't know what's up with me lol",General_disorder

Without going into excruciating detail I have raw dogged my mental illness (still undiagnosed) since I was 10. I have gotten by mostly on the art of being numb. It has work all of my life. However, now that I am 30 and have a stable life I can't seem to stop falling into my default mode. I want to feel the things normal people do but when I feel thing its all or nothing.

for example:

Anger is the easiest emotion for me to feel. So when I feel angry its like popping a cork on the emotion bottle and for the next few days I feel all the emotions I have bottled up for better or worse.

Take to day as a prime example, at work I got pissed at a coworker and I am still spiraling on the roller coaster of sad, happy, angry, back to sad, back to angry, back to happy, etc.

I literally let myself feel angry and now I cant stop the on-slot of emotions.

I fought for 5 years before anyone would entertain the idea of bipolar simply because they hadn't seen me manic (or hypomanic). 
2 years ago a psychiatrist finally conceded that I might be right and prescribed me a low dose mood stabiliser.

I honestly stopped thinking about him, itâ€™s like I really forgot him.

They say my dad is doing much much better and is like how he used to be when he was younger, apparently heâ€™s finally taking his meds. They want me to see him sometime soon and hopefully itâ€™ll go well. Problem with this is my dad is a very, VERY good liar.  Iâ€™m scared if I see him heâ€™ll take me away from my home and all my loved ones. Which I may be thinking too far, but honestly I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if he was tricking my family and was planning to kill us all, then himself. I remember him sending me voice messages like that sometimes, it scares me.

My birthday is coming up in June and my dad is going to wanna give me a birthday gift, I thought maybe this could be a stepping stone to rebuilding our relationship. Iâ€™m also scared he uses this birthday gift as leverage over my mom, and calls the police on her probably claiming she stole it.

"Everyone has dark days, but on very rare occasions, there are days so dark you can see no light, no hope and no way out. 
These times, often coined: â€œthe dark night of the soulâ€, tear through your heart, your nervous system and your sense that anything can be normal again. There is but one lasting way out of this darkness and that is by working through it. 
What memory or pain are these murky depths trying to bring to your attention? 
Who or what comes to mind in this abyss? 
As ugly, as painful or enraging these monstrous memories from your past are, they are your key to escape, to free yourself from these depths of depression, to heal and release once and for all. What parasitic thought has been holding you hostage? 
Recognition is the first step to liberty, acknowledge it and feel whatever feeling arises, if you feel anger, then release that anger, scream, cry, and use a punching bag or take a baseball bat to the earth to release any pent up anger. 
If you feel sorrow, then grieve until your eyes run dry, if you feel guilt or regret, then confront it and forgive yourself, feel those feelings, let them go, then release them. Denial of these unconscious emotions allows them to thrive, so acknowledge, confront, process and release. 
These efforts hold the keys to your freedom from the dark place, they create space for a spark of hope to fully illuminate your being once more. 
Build your courage and walk forward into the depths, they are only thoughts and feelings and both can be felt or changed, you are the only master of your state of mind, so plough through the darkness and into your light, as the only way is through.",General_disorder

Iâ€™m just looking for someone to validate my emotions here. Iâ€™ve been mentally ill basically my entire life.

Now Iâ€™m a sophomore in high school and my mental health is plummeting year after year. I know it gets better once I move out and start living on my own and stuff like that but I canâ€™t help resent my parents for not letting me get help. Last year I had to go to the doctor finally because my depression was so awful that I was not sleeping more than probably 20 minutes a night. I lied on the questionnaire trying to maybe slide off the hook and have the doctor give me some sleeping pills or something ( I didnâ€™t want to be there because I knew this would happen). But even describing â€œmildâ€ symptoms I was still diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. I know sometimes those questionnaires are vague but still. I always thought getting a diagnose would make me feel better because Iâ€™d have a name to what Iâ€™ve been feeling my entire life but I just felt my entire world crumble. My mom was in the room with me and started talking over me explaining to the doctor why I had to feel this way (it was all bullshit). My doctor wanted me to seek therapy and be on antidepressants and my mom started sobbing and begging for me to be put on some herbal plant bullshit because it was â€œnaturalâ€. On the way home she ranted about how she was seen as a shitty parent because of what I did and told me I shouldâ€™ve just talked to friends about it because thatâ€™s what she did when she was young but I donâ€™t think she realizes most of the people I hang out with are other mentally ill teenagers and we donâ€™t always like to hang out and have a sob story circlejerk.

About a year ago my Dr. brought up AXS-05 to me and encouraged me to reearch it, which I did. It is a new drug that should be released Q2 or Q3 2022. It is just a combination of 105mg bupropion and 45mg DXM (dextromethorphan). Dextromethorphan is the DM is Robitussin DM. I was already taking 300mg bupropion XL daily anyway so we changed it to 150mg bupropion XL and 45mg DXM in the am and the same in the PM. It costs all of $1.50/day!!!

My depression was in complete remission within weeks and has remained there! It has been life-changing for me. I don't remember ever not being depressed before. See below link and google Axsome AXS-05 for more info.

"I have been on and off near every class of psychiatric medications since I was 11, SSRI's, SNRI's, anti-psychotics, MAOI's you name it. Over the last year I have decided to not take medication for my mental illness other than my ADHD meds, I take Straterra. My moods have been intense and I can feel myself slipping, it's hard to keep up with college and work while also maintaining healthy relationships and I feel going back on medication could help me right now, despite it being a hard choice. I am diagnosed with Major depressive disorder, BPD, panic disorder, generalized anxiety, and ptsd. I do not want to go on medications with a risk of weight gain either as that is a big fear of mine after losing a significant amount of weight (that I gained from taking meds). Some of my symptoms right now causing me the most trouble is the fear of abandonment, severe anxiety and rapid cycling mood swings. I understand everyone is different and everyone's body chemistry is different so what works for someone may not for me but I am just looking to see what others here may have tried and found relief with if you have these disorders or the stated symptoms have alleviated for you since taking a certain medication. Anything helps thank you!

"Maybe itâ€™s because I watched Everything Everywhere All at Once last month, but I canâ€™t help but think about the missed opportunities and possibilities that I had in the past. And it depresses me.

I had an opportunity to move to New York and couldâ€™ve done big things with my art. I was given the chance to join a band that later ended up with some success. I couldâ€™ve studied harder in high school and attended my dream school. I couldâ€™ve gotten proper treatment for ADHD and autism as a child and avoided loads of childhood trauma. Thereâ€™s so many more.

In this reality, I went to university and ended up dropping out because my mental health issues were so bad I went to the mental hospital. Iâ€™m now living with my parents at 20. Iâ€™m doing nothing with my life.

All of this depresses me. Iâ€™m not sure what to do with my life and I really donâ€™t have anything going for me.

This will last a while then it will resolve and Iâ€™ll feel ok Iâ€™m getting things done my relationships are back on track then I fall into that cycle (ocd is present through all of this worse when Iâ€™m moody) anyways Iâ€™ve heard form my psychiatrist this could be bi polar but Iâ€™m only 16.

She is a rly rly pure and loving person and we having been dating for 1 whole year now. However recently once I took my flight to come here on vacation where I still am at, she had a desk from me for 2 days and in these 2 days she rly blew up my phone and I texted her back and loved her right back. By the way we usually talk all night and we rly love each other. About 3 days ago she told me she lost feelings. However I didnâ€™t belive her bc he spent every second talking with me and loving me and singing to me and allll that. And this happened before too when she said she lost feelings but came back to me saying sheâ€™s sorry and she made a mistake and she still loves me and she told me last time that it was bc of a manic episode that she acted this way. I forgave her and everything went back to normal til now. Continuing, I said oh God is this another episode and she said yes. And so me and my friend Anna supported her through her episode and the next night she seemed to be doing better but then she blocked both of us after saying I love u to me. Then for the past 3-4 days Iâ€™ve been fighting just to talk to her again  and she kept blocking and unblocking me. Finally I went to her toxic friend who she cut off as my last hope and now she didnâ€™t let me join the ft or anything but she told me that my girlfriend is done with me.

"TW: mentions of suicide/ self harm/ hallucinations 

im seeing the school counsellor but i literally dont know what to say. so much has happened since i last saw her. the last time i saw her, it was before spring break and i was extremely suicidal. like, i even planned everything out. i thought about death everyday. 

during spring break, i was like a completely different person. i stopped doing things that i was enjoying doing before and then i stopped being suicidal. 

rn ive only thought about death in a sort of â€œjokingâ€ manner. like ill say it in my head but not out loud. and youâ€™d think that i would be getting better right? wrong. i would have a short temper and lash out at anything and everything. 

i once was sick and i couldnt breathe out of my right nostril so i punched my face. long story short, i had a bruise on the right side of my face. then i would hit the sides of my head. again, i would get bruises and headaches. that was around the time my derealisation and depersonalisation got really bad (not worse cus ive had worse). i didnt think i was real, i would dissociate, i would cry and beg for everything to be over. then it did. it stopped. for about a week cus if it had stopped for good i wouldnt be writing this.

so, it stopped. great good! right? nope. it started again after a couple days maybe a week. but with that, it came with my new bestie, jared, my auditory/ visual hallucination! we first met when he whispered hello and then my name really clearly! then he started to breathe on my neck ( especially at night). he then decided to be a bitch and show up in the corners of my eyes, and give me a lot of paranoia because i didnt want to see my familyâ€™s face in case they were different people! hes scares me at night cus he knows that i would laugh if he did something in the morning. hes a bitch. 

anyways atm, i have little to no energy to do anything. the phone im writing on rn is so heavy. i cant even stand without collapsing. i cant eat, i cant piss, i cant drink, i cant walk down the stairs (i get too out of breath that it takes me so long to go back upstairs. so yeah, i guess im doing amazing. oh and derealisation and depersonalisation are still here and probably not leaving in a bit.",General_disorder

Constantly online people hate men...not to mention me a straight black man. I stood up for myself and I have no friends. Idk what to do about my gf who recently started treating me differently. Like how can people consistently tell you positive things and give you compliments and consistently say you're so different...yet you get treated like you're nothing. You're entire life. I've experienced a lot since I was young and I notice people use that to their advantage to cater to their own mental health....they know it's not much left for me to experience when it comes to pain so they use my wisdom for their gain...even a former therapist....who I paid to help me. Nobody in my family cares about me....literally had a cousin steal $12,000 for me and the entire family covered for him and hid him from me....I admit I've had my share of mistakes and I know I'm capable of violent things because I was taught to fight to where I'm decent if someone underestimates me even slightly. I know I'm not a bad ass it's just to help people understand why I try to be so nice....I've seen how dark I can get and I refuse to go back. I'd rather die than go back to that feeling. But yet it's creeping daily. I've lost all faith in people and I'm literally losing my mind and emotions. I've always been suicidal and somehow I survive every single time death is assured in the situation ...literally always.

Be normal. I'm unstable. I know I am. I feel horrible, so so horrible for simply existing in a state of chaos in my mind.

I have depressive episodes that last for days, weeks, or months. They're exhausting. I feel like an endless void of numbness and sadness. Oftentimes, nothing triggers these episodes. Or, at least, nothing I can think of. I'm currently experiencing one. I have zero energy and my muscles feel weak. Everything that I've recently put so much effort into, I have dropped entirely. My brain tells me that I don't want to be alive, even when I logically know that I want to. But the emotion gets so overwhelming. My motivation is depleting, and I'm wasting time on doing nothing. I haven't cooked or cleaned or completed my college work. I need to shower but I don't want to move. I've been in the same spot almost all day...

On the opposite end, I sometimes feel like I'm elated on drugs even when I'm not. No joke, I sometimes wonder if someone has slipped molly into my water because I will feel AMAZING for hours, days, weeks, and months. It doesn't make sense to me. I get extremely agitated and irritated, but only because the world isn't moving as fast as me. My thoughts race. I pride myself in being reckless and spontaneous. I impulsively spend money with zero thought for consequences, even when I know I shouldn't, I just can't control it. I hyperfixate on goals and when I don't achieve them perfectly, I'll spend hours attempting to do so. I'll go almost entirely without sleep some nights. My friends tell me I'm impulsive and unpredictable. Stupid decisions I make haunt me when I'm depressed, and I easily quit jobs and cut off family members and friends. I won't plan anything. I just do. I make stupid decisions. Before this depressive episode, I've been speeding on the freeway going 95+ mph at night because it feels so good. I was contemplating quiting my job, even though I have a good job, for no reason at all and just for the hell of it. I've done it many many times before. I self sabotage and have impulsively ended relationships for no good reason at all. I left my ex last year in the middle of the night and flew to California, only to fly back the next day and try again. I feel like people use my spontaneity and risk taking to their advantage, and I feel like I'm easily manipulated but also smarter and even better looking (I know this isn't true!!) than most during these phases. My self esteem and self perception fluctuates with my revolving moods, unfortunately. Sometimes I don't recognize myself and it scares me.

When I was 18, I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Of the two antidepressants I've tried, neither have worked. I'm so scared. I'm paranoid of dying. Time is passing by too fast. I'm afraid that I might have some sort of a mood disorder, and I'm going to speak with a psychologist soon about it, but I don't want to. I don't want there to be more things ""wrong"" with me.

"i dont want a diagnose or anything but i just need to talk abt this. i have a couple things that have felt rather traumatic to me, which i will list and what triggers it. but the thing is i just feel like it doesn't count, or like im just overreacting because hearing what type of trauma other people have is worse than mine. anyways, the biggest things are:

getting diagnosed with diabetes when i was seven - had to start getting independant in an early age, had to learn everything and was so scared in the beginning. now i feel like i'll never be able to do anything normal or have a normal life again.

when i was sick in january - couldn't stop throwing up one night and that made me unable to eat anything. and bc of my diabetes it was important to get some nutrition in me. couldn't do that, parents had to call an ambulance at 1 am, stayed in the hospital for a day or so.

was in a store after being out with a friend in early february, got low blood sugar and almost passed out - scared the shit out of me and had a panic attack, sat on the floor in that supermarket with my mom and my friend for maybe an hour, until we decided that my dad would pick us up. been dizzy constantly since then and occasionally light headed and nauseous, as well as panic attacks in the beginning. still can't attend school normally, parents decided to talk to the principal and im just gonna be attending lessons that are crucial to attend in person.

those are basically the worst, but especially the last two. like if i start feeling nauseous ill go into a mode of panic and think that everything is gonna just replay again. and the worst thing is i sometimes get a random smell of the hospital, like that specific smell and it makes me unable to think about anything else than being in the hospital and it triggers me a lot. and with the dizzyness or whatever, it gets worse when im under stress and having to do diabetes check ups every 6 months + being forced to go to neurologists, health centers and a curator/therapist (idk the name in english) to try and figure out what's wrong with me makes me feel even worse, and it's not done anything beneficial for us so far. and having low blood sugar makes me feel even worse too. a couple days ago at around midnight my blood sugar just went down very quickly and I was down at a pretty dangerously low number and i was so insanely dizzy, light headed, had a headache, stomachache, super nauseous and was really scared. my mom ended up having to sit in my room for a pretty long time until i could calm down enough to fall asleep. and every time now i see that arrow pointing straight down in the app i use to check my blood sugar, i freak out and get panicky even though ive had low blood sugar countless times since I was diagnosed.",General_disorder

"**Ready to get on with the rest your life?**

Regardless of our past experiences, we all have the ability to live in the present. With time, effort and practice, we can make the most of each day to live our best lives.

These practices help us leave the past behind and live in the present:

**Accept the past.** Events have already happened. We canâ€™t undo them. We canâ€™t wish them away â€“ thatâ€™s just physics! Now is the best time to acknowledge them, learn whatever can be learned from them and apply that learning to the present.  

**Recognize that your past doesnâ€™t need to define you.**  Thinking that the future will automatically be the same as the past is a common limiting belief which we can challenge. Situations themselves do not define us â€“ how we choose to respond to them does.

**Let go.** Sometimes easier said than done but entirely do-able. I guide most of my clients through a â€˜letting goâ€™ process which they can use whenever they wish thereafter.

**Take a look at your present life.** Taking stock of your health, family, relationships, home, personal development, career, leisure etc (in terms of whatever these things mean to you) provides a starting point. 

**Create the life you want.** For each of these areas, decide how you would prefer them to be.

**Immerse yourself in each moment.** Youâ€™ve probably experienced the frustration and irritation of being involved in one activity while youâ€™re actually thinking about something else. Develop the habit of asking yourself what is the most valuable thing you could be doing right now to progress towards one of your visions for the future.  
 

**Check in with your emotions.** Reflect on how you feel. Are you energized? Is your mood melancholy? How do you feel about what youâ€™re doing right now? Explore what you are learning from your reflections.  
   
 

**When you live in the present, doing what is most valuable to you, reflecting and learning, you will be on your way to living your best life.**",General_disorder

It has been a long route, and Iâ€™m exhausted. And there is still no lights in the tunnel, Iâ€™ve not reached the end yet to see one.",General_disorder
"I have too been determined to end my life. I remember how unbearable my pain was. Somehow, I had a small will within me that did not want that for myself. I had not thought about those around me. All I could focus on was my pain and what I lack. For a long time, pain blinded me from seeing that there are people who are going through pain too. There are people who have given up. The loss of these people is yet another life and light lost in a world that needs light. I implore you to care more about yourself than to let yourself wither away. There is more to life than you are seeing at this moment. Whatever it is, do not let it discourage you, do not let it overcome you, do not let it take away your life. There are many people in this world who do not understand. Please do not take their words to heart and mind. Instead, take mine. I love you. Do you love yourself? You do not deserve such a loss of hope and pain. If you get through this, you will see possibilities and realities you never thought possible to you. But if you take your life, you will take these possibilities with you, and they will have no chance. There are people out there who are struggling, who feel there are no other options, who feel similarly. I want to let you know that there are many resources that can help and if you are interested just ask me about them. They are resources which have helped me tremendously, and even saved my life. You belong here right now. Please do not remove yourself from a place wherein you belong. Listen to me, to love, to light, to peace, to possibility, to others who need the same things you need at this moment. You may not see them now but you will, I promise, because I have seen it myself, through this journey. I am here to welcome and listen to you. Please pour your heart out to me if you wish.

Many people may wrong you in life. Do not listen to these people for they know not what they say. There is no love and hope behind their messages, only ignorance and insensitivity. But it is proper to forgive them for this. What you are going through is very painful. When all one can see is pain and darkness, suicide can feel like it is the only solution. I know this because I have experienced this. I have also experienced the journey over the mountain that seemed insurmountable before I got a closer look, back when I was too distant to see how it was not what I expected. I have come to a place where I can experience having interest and passions, love and peace, and see and appreciate light and beauty. When I see people suffering, considering suicide, my heart breaks. My heart broke in a way I had not imagined it could after I left my darkness. There are things that exist before you that you cannot see. I am referring to love, possibility, and all good things. You are worthy of love. The journey is hard at times but never lose courage and hope. Hold those like you are holding for your dear life, which you are, and never let go. As I said, there are things you have yet to experience and know, as does everyone, but it can be harder to see when you are in the darkness. There is a light at the end of the journey. Do not listen to the darkness, seek the light and someday you will be in it, because at the end of this journey you belong in and return to the light. If you are wondering, as did I, I cannot answer why we go through such darkness, but I know well of its afflictions, and through those afflictions there will be light. Look for the light so you can see in the dark. It is truly there, and you will find it. You will have good things. You will have a beautiful life, and you will look back on these moments and be thankful you did not take your life along with all of the chances for possibilities and opportunities you deserve to have. They may not be here now but they will come.  

Someone dear to me gave me something so precious that I want to share with you

â€œWe can look at our efforts, even the smallest efforts, as progress. We must breathe and find peace in our little bit of effort as we move forward.â€ 
But these words are only precious because they reflect on how equally precious you and I are.
 Mark these words. A dear friend gave them to me.

But the process and progress is gradual, and some days I am making no progress, some days I am. 

I want to make you feel better, that's all. I want to rid you of your suffering. I wish I could take it all away. 

It is a blessing that you are here, and please donâ€™t try to leave this world. There are people who can help. People who care about you. Including me. There are many resources, including the suicide hotline and crisis text line which has helped me a few times. I also have many coping strategies I can give you and recommend that can help including DBT and CBT therapy, mindfulness exercises, yoga, etc. Please seek help from others, from people too. It may be a long journey, but never give up.

For those of you who have been done wrong, You do NOT deserve to be mistreated, by yourself or others. Be kind to yourself, you need to have yourself at your side. You are suffering and some are not there to love and support you. I donâ€™t know why, but hopefully they or others will come to love and support you like you deserve and become your family. Maybe someday you can be there for someone or many people who are going through what you are going through right now, or any kind of pain for that matter. The pain you carry with you can turn into something beautiful, truly, and give you more to offer to yourself and possibly others carrying the same pain you are carrying. Be kind to yourself and never forget that you have good by your side, and people like me keep you in our thoughts and prayers. Do you care for and love yourself?

You see, everyone has a story. There is so much more I wish to tell you, this is but a fraction of what I want to tell you. Mark these words and take them to heart. Each and every one. Never forget that there are people like me who contend with you.

"What is this visual triggering issue that I am suffering from? And does anyone relate?
Sometimes i can see something visual (usually on a computer) that triggers some kind of panic shock in me. (Not seizure, something else) I will explain more. There are many examples. Its probably not seizure as flashing lights arenâ€™t uncomfortable at all, there are some visuals that trigger panic shock for me, will explain some examples below. 
First example: replications
I am a game developer, and sometimes if my code goes wrong, where for example an object instance replicates so quickly on screen, it looks so uncomfortable to me and triggers some panic shock. The quick replication looks so uncomfortable to me.
Also I have had many nightmares before  in my sleep of replication of different objects, one of them, is that I have a stool chair in my house, in that dream I suddenly found another, and wondered I didnâ€™t know that we have two of it, then suddenly I saw a third stool chair in my house, then a fourth and so on.... it became so uncomfortable and scary that I closed my eyes and wanted to wake up as soon as possible

Another example is the polar inversion effect in image editors, the resulting effect is so scary and triggered a panic shock to me, I never use this effect anymore. I used it once on a photo to know what its effect is and got a panic shock that I closed the editor immediately.

A third example: I wanted to make an NFT images project for fun, i made some layers, a layer for different eye shapes, another layer for different mouth shapes, a layer for hairs, etc. then I coded a program (for fun) to output all possible combinations into image files, there were 4000 possible combinations. I clicked run and the program started creating the image files, after creating 3200 files the computer froze. And the result was that the last 800 image files were exactly the same. The rest were outputted correctly.When i opened the files and saw the last 800 files that looked exactly the same that looked so uncomfortable and I got the panic shock. After 3200 correct images, looking at the last exactly similar 800 images was so scary and uncomfortable. I never tried to create NFT images again afterwards
Looks like most of the uncomfortable visuals that trigger panic shock to me happen from glitches in code.  
These are some examples. What is my issue called????? Is there a name for it?? Is it maybe some kind of OCD? Or maybe some kind of seizure? (But i donâ€™t get seizures and flashing lights donâ€™t bother me) And does anyone else relate??",General_disorder
"(I talk about Panic attacks and OCD so trigger warning).
 I just went through a 5-day panic attack extravaganza. It was my first panic attack experience, which left me with chills, nausea, shaky legs, confusion, and the worst 2, feeling crazy and derealization. It had about maybe 2 panic attacks in total but the â€œhangoverâ€ and feeling like I was on the â€œedgeâ€ of one still stuck around, and Iâ€™m barely recovering (ðŸ¤ž). Yesterday I lost my iPhone charger so I had use someone elseâ€™s, but today I feel really freaked out that I donâ€™t know where it is but I need to rest and donâ€™t have the mental wherewithal to search the entire house. Can yâ€™all tell me how I can go of it so I can rest? I think itâ€™s making me feel disoriented again.",General_disorder
"I was doing okay for maybe 2 weeks. Now I'm doing really badly again. I've felt like this as long as I can remember with very occasional periods of feeling okay. I just feel deeply miserable. I'm intensely depressed, I have severe hallucinations, I'm borderline, I can go on. I'm so tired. Sleeping helps me a lot because it gives me a break but I can't sleep all the time. From the second I get out of bed to go to work to the second I get home, all I want to do is go home and sleep with my sweet little cat. I don't want to be seen by anyone other than her, I want to keep my lights off and stay under my blankets, and read and watch TV with her. I need a break but I can't get one because of how behind on my hour requirement I am. I want to be alone and not see anyone. I try to use the fact that I do get to go home and sleep as motivation to get through my days but it doesn't feel like it's enough. I've told my psychiatrist all of this and all she could do was increase my antipsychotic (latuda). My antidepressant (zoloft) doesn't seem to be helping at all. I'm also still having regular panic attacks, so I'm assuming that my anti-anxiety (propranolol extended release) isn't doing its job. I don't know what to do. I really need help.",General_disorder
"I struggle with being stressed over some sleep issues I've been having. I'm getting sounds, musics, noises, and other sounds around sleep. I had this checked out and I was told hypnagogic hallucinations and they're normal. I thought maybe stress or anxiety was the cause. I still get symptoms regardless. I thought about a sleep issues. I'm getting a good 7 or 8 hours of sleep. I usually don't feel tired throughout the day either. I'm not drinking or using drugs. I honestly can't figure this out.",General_disorder
"I'm a 17 y/o M

I started having compulsions, obsessions and intrusive thoughts when I was 11/12. Most notable symptoms are/and were excessive hand washing (which caused bleading knuckles, I still do it but moisturizer keeps me whole), doing tic like physical/vocal compulsions and movements/touching object until it feels just right, and obsessive overthinking. Then I also have doubting behaviour of my and others intentions and catastrophic thoughts.

Now the thing is, I think I manage my behaviors and anxiety pretty well, I have learned to live with them, I feel like I use my excsessive cleaning, tidiness and fear of germs in a moderated manner, I don't have as many tics (I still have a few) and the ones I do have I also do in moderation in a non apparent way (I at least don't think people notice, my parents only noticed some when I was younger) and thanks to meditation I feel like I can suppress or let go of most thoughts and anxiety inducing impulses (although sometimes I can't).

Thus, I feel like I shouldn't seek help. I don't want to minimize or diminish the extensive and strenuous process of therapy and managing a mental illness, but I feel like I have already done what one can do? But I also feel like I'm lying to myself in contradictory ways, one lie says that I'm lying about being okay, and the other says that I'm lying about my symptoms and their possible connection to a mental illness.

I don't know what to do, I live in Sweden and since I'm under 18 I get free health care, but I feel like therapy can't help that much? Like there's CBT/ERP, but I've kinda done that myself, but did what I did really do what CBT/ERP can do? And if it did, are my problems even that severe to seek help for? And then there's medication, and I don't know how I would feel about taking meds, like would they just f*ck me up? Or would they help but give me side effects or just numb my brain?

But I also feel like if I would go to therapy they'd either 1. Dismiss me and my symptoms, and just think I'm a hypochondriac, or 2. I would lie my way to get a diagnosis. 

I hope this made sense to anyone, please leave your thoughts on what I should do.",General_disorder

"Hi guys. I've been battling idk what to call it, overthinking anxiety etc what ever for almost an year and I never really took a step against it.

There's lot going on in my life I'll try to brief down.
Since childhood I was a guy who would be smart intelligent and extrovert and would like to be grabbing every opportunity to the fullest. No fears at all and no overthinking.

Since a year ago, I've been watching many alpha male videos and my mindset totally changed and ego / proud whatever came into me.
I read more and more about alpha males and was living virtual imagination life that I'm so powerful I can achieve anything I will be first billionaire in my family, I can rule world etc...

I started exercising going to gym and my sex drive peaked I was in my fullest. Remember all this was in lockdown, I had no connection with my classmates as I thought I'm superior to them etc

But then suddenly out of nowhere I remembered a fight from childhood. I joked upon a boy, this boy is shorter and leaner than me but he took joke seriously and hit me a punch. Having a punch at that age was very shocking to me and I literally cried that day how can my friend be so mad at silly joke etc..

Then in my college there was a confrontation in talk with some classmate , I was not wrong there, we didn't really talk from then.

But then I recalled the childhood incident and this incident and I thought I have nice body still I can't dare to fight etc , slowly I went to depression due to overthinking,I started feeling shame on manliness on mine, I left gym , my body has no strength, even in my daily life I fear so much to speak harsh to anyone bcoz I know my body is weak , and for silliest thing I overthink everything and drain my energy, I've dark circles and no real friends and no enjoyment in life.

This all is happening since 1 year. 

I'm preparing for prestigious exam and this exam can change my life. But the moment I start studying all these things comes into my mind and I overthink let's say Tommorow in college while giving test somebody asked to show paper and I didn't what will happen etc etc. I'm totally drained .

I see in my class everyone is so jealous of me they don't wanna see me succeed I hate those eyes looking at me. They always poke me by asking what am I studying now from where I'm studying etc I don't wanna tell them but I can't say them directly this, to maintain a normal relationship . But this comes to mind what if they found me learning from different sources etc ..

Due to all this my mood of studying is dead I have very prestigious exams in very near future how do I become totally unshakable , emotionally stable ......


I feel less of man and have lost quality errections, and that in childhood I was totally opposite. I wanna bring that guy back , guys please help me I'm in terrible need .pleaseee I wanna become that stud guy again totally fearless",General_disorder
"Iâ€™m pretty certain Iâ€™ve been dealing with OCD or something similar for years now but Iâ€™ve yet to get it checked out.

Thereâ€™s always something for me to obsess about. I always believe that whatever it is Iâ€™m obsessing about in the moment is the biggest problem ever and Iâ€™ll never be able to get over it. Most of the obsessions, other than the few big ones that constantly stick with me, get completely forgotten about after a while.

Youâ€™d think with this being the case, Iâ€™d be able to convince myself in the moment to stop worrying about the obsession, but it just isnâ€™t possible. Even if Iâ€™m not actively thinking of whateverâ€™s bothering me I feel uncomfortable for however long the obsession decides to stick in the back of my head.

"Okay so basically, I tend to research mental illnessess/mood disorders/learning disabilities, it's always been interesting to learn about different people I know irl, in TV shows or celebrities plus I hope.to become a phychiatrist one day. I was researching Borderline Personality Disorder recently after I hear about it somewhere (I forget where) and learnt about the different symptoms and traits. 

I looked at it for a month or 2 but stopped after my school told me it was 'inappropriate' to search on school laptops. Over the last few days though, I have been continuously brought back to it after looking at dissociation/depersonalisation disorders after realising that I've been disassociating most of my life. I remember seeing that it was a common symptom among people with BPD. 

I didn't think much of it but decided to look back on other symptoms of it because why not and I am starting to think that maybe I could have it. I can't decide for myself but I don't really know who to go to right now. My friends are all going thru their own shit, my parents are in the middle of a divorce and my school is no good (we reported bullying that included being stalked, hit multiple times and verbally abused but were told we were 'grossly over exaggerating and we could have gotten people in trouble for minor things' being followed around for hours on multiple occasions haveing homophobic insults yelled at us from down the street is most definitely s minor thing).

Anyway, I have looked at the symptoms over and over again, I took loads of those tests online and stuff that said I had a high probability (they are probably not very reliable but I'm kinda freaking out here) but anyway like I said idk anyone in real life and desperate times call for desperate measures and I am asking the people of Reddit for their opinion.

So yeah, here are the symptoms (I think) that were similar to how I've seen BPD described:

â€¢Self identification, I've always had a love hate relationship with my body,  I'll detail more below but I've thought terrible things about myself , about how I look and  how I act. I go through periods of loving something about myself but then suddenly everything changes and I hate it and I hate myself, stuff I used to look in the mirror and think hey that's awesome I could look and think wow I hate it, I hate me

â€¢Self harm/self distructisve behaviours, looking back on the past year or two I've been very self distructisve, I went through periods of eating barely anything, them giving up and binge eating and then growing depressed and angry about how much I eat and making myself throw up. (That has quite a lot to do with the self hate) I've purposely messed up friendships, stolen and lied I don't know why I just get this weird feeling sometimes like I'm not doing enough or I'm not enough and I just get so upset with myself and sometimes it's a self punishment thing and sometimes I'm trying to suppress my anger against someone else.

â€¢Black and white thinking, this is something my friends always get annoyed at me for, I find it hard to not immediately turn against anyone to do something slightly negative towards me and though I've recently become a bit better at realising the negatives of thinking like that I still tend to categorize people as good or bad, with me or against me by one simple action and them forgive much bigger once or overlook them after already making my decision of them.

â€¢Fear of being alone, until I was around 12 I didn't have any friends in school other than one girls who would just control me and turn everyone against me and since I became friends with her I've definitely become quite clingy as s friend, I have a constant fear that my friends will realize that I'm not good enough and just abandone me. For about a week in around the time I was binge eating I pushed my friends away and it was the most depressing thing ever, I was just thinking about how they would all never want to talk to me ever again and it was quite terrifying

â€¢Impulsiveness, as mentioned above, I had trouble with binge eating but that's it really

â€¢Intense emotions, I have always had quite magnified emotions. I don't think I'm ever just 'ok' I'm either extremely happy, really depressed or really angry. I don't think there's much in between.

â€¢ Disassociation, as I mentioned at the start I experience A LOT of this


So yes, I basically don't want to claim out of my own opinion that I have BPD, this is basically just em asking should I tell someone that I've noticed similarities between BPD symptoms and my everyday behaviours or if you do not agree with the similarities them maybe offer some advice to how I go about, well idk ... dealing with this, I haven't told anyone yet really and it's very much effecting me at the moment and the fact that I'm stressing about this just isn't helping so yeah....

"I think an aspect of mental illness that is barely mentioned (at least to me) is how exhausting it gets when youâ€™re constantly plagued by your thoughts.

Itâ€™s like every single day I wake up I canâ€™t go without feeling like complete crap or feeling like I should end everything.

my girlfriend is going to commit suicide soon. i can't deal with trying to figure out if she's going to be okay or not it's too stressful i want to break up with her soon.

but if i do she will go in a frenzy since she has mental issues and will most likely hurt herself, she has self harmed recently and just today tried to down a bottle of pills but i stopped her she keeps making me promise to make sure i'd look after her mother and dog when she does it, has tried to call out to legal suicide places in switzerland and canada to help with assisted suicide.

just to mention she has adhd and finds it hard to concentrate and possible BPD if she does its quite extreme, has alot of mood swings

i've tried talking to people when she attempted before i called the guards (irish police) they were help then they said next time call an ambulance instead which is plan on doing as well as telling CAHMS and her GP before i break the news. me and her breaking up wouldn't be a reason for suicide.

her parents doesn't help she is polish and they are very strict emptionally and doesn't really understand or believe her. i'm sick of her life being put on my hands. it's stressful and i just want to not worry about her anymore because i'm feeling worse because of it and then if something happens to her i wouldn't be able to live with myself plus i love and care for her and her health.

I have my final state exams soon i just cant focus.

shes abusive mentally and sometimes physically

brings the worst out of me, destroys me mentally

i want her to get help and to not be my ""problem"" but i do love her its just stressful worrying about her mental health all the time. as i speak she hung up after she was cutting up a razor blade to self harm. she doesn't use suicide as a excuse if i leave she just tells me she wants to and makes subtle hints about how she wants to or will soon and when she has melt downs she leaves the house so i put a tracker on her phone to make sure i know where she is but i don't want to do this anymore.

I live in Ireland, Shes 17, Im 18 \*M\*

She is going therapy and camhs all of which are not helping her.

talking to her parents wont help either as her dad isn't there and her mum disregards her issues because of her up bringing.

help me i need a way to be able to make sure she will be okay and not have to hurt myself in this process.

im afriad ill turn out like she is.

help me please. i need someone.",General_disorder
"This is a super important post so pls donâ€™t delete mods! Iâ€™m trying to get the word out about this so people in desperate help arenâ€™t lied to. 

Terence Wattsâ€™s â€œBrainWorking Recursive Therapyâ€ or, â€œBWRTâ€ is a scam. This man is preying on vulnerable people by marketing this as a â€œfull proofâ€ solution to most mental health issues, without the (ACTUAL) evidence to back it up!!

Many have deleted their original opinions voicing their doubts, or are too afraid to speak up, due to the threat of legal action and/or harassment. Honestly, itâ€™s giving MLM / pyramid scheme / scientology vibes. 

I was so amazed at first, and truly believed Iâ€™d finally stumbled across a great solution to my problems, until I pondered how it really DID sound too good to be trueâ€¦ so I looked around to see what others had been saying about it. 

The man has blocked me / deleted my comments on his Youtube videos, as he doesnâ€™t want anyone to criticise his scheme and warn others. I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if this post / my account got taken down too. So if I donâ€™t respond or you donâ€™t see this post anymoreâ€¦ well I guess you know why. 

Maybe some aspects of it can help for you as a byproductâ€¦ but I at least URGE everyone to apply critical thinking and do your own extensive research on it first before you come to any conclusions.

"(M 18) 
(Background info: BPD, ADD and Depression all run in my family. I started taking antidepressants such as Lexapro, Prozac, Seratralene, Mirtazapine and Clonodine. Seratralene being my most recent. Iâ€™ve also taken a mood stabilizer and an anti anxiety medication mix sometime before the Seratralene but I cannot remember the names and which is which. The mood stabilizer had the best impact on me but I have repeatedly gone cold turkey on all of my pills after I â€œfeel betterâ€. I do understand it takes 2 weeks for them to take full effect and that cold turkey does nothing good for me physically and mentally. I have since not taken any medication other than an occasional Trazadone to help me sleep longer.)

Ever since I turned 14 things have gone downhill with my mental health. Iâ€™ve seen therapist for as long as I can remember and understand allot about mental health and tools to help myself. I would just like a little bit of advice or new knowledge to help me better understand my case.

It generally starts with me noticing Iâ€™m not eating as much, or too much. Most cases an average person in a depressive state would sleep constantly but I sleep 5 to 6 hours on a good night. Intrusive thoughts will creep in while seeing/doing the simplest things. On the off chance I start having ideations is where I speak out and talk to a trusted person. Though I have yet to be diagnosed with BPD I show characteristics that align with it while some also align with depression. I do have very high high and very low lows. I used to go in cycles before going to bed but have worked on the and now I just used video games to help keep that aside and will not go to bed until I can barely keep my eyes open. Iâ€™ve brought up the BPD to 2 therapist and the old on said no that I donâ€™t have it but my new one ran a sort of off the head check list to see what characteristics I have that align with BPD. I have not looked at a general list and do not know if there is one but I would say it is about 50/50. I am willing to start back up on medications and understand that no one pill helps everyone the same, I am just tired of having to wait and see if whatever new pill I start taking is gonna help me or make me worse.

"I've been verbally abused for about 8 years now, betrayed by my father, minpulated, and emotionally neglected, by both my parents. Is the short way of telling it.  They are now divorced, everyone acts like it's getting better but it isn't. 

I have lived in the same one bedroom apartment for 4 year, I remember everything. 
I remember seeing my step mother overdosed on the bathroom floor
I remember my parents physically fighting in front of me
I remember coming home to a disgusting home with trash, roaches, and flies every day.
I remember always being called an idiot and being told to act my age by my parents.
I remember having to feed myself everyday because we never ate as a family, there was no dinning room table to.
I remember trying to comfort my crying brother, after my dad just tried to strangle him at 12 years old.

I sleep on the floor, I've never had my own room, or privacy. I'm not allowed to have friends, I'm not allowed to go outside, I'm not allowed to have a boyfriend, I'm not allowed to fall in love, I'm not allowed to have a job, my dad doesn't want me to move out till I'm in my mid twenties. 

I've always been told to suck it up, and everytime I speak about my feelings, or trying to open up, I get told to stop with my attention seeking bullshit, and stop playing the victim, that I don't know what true suffering is, and my problems are non existent. 

I'm 15, and I have no friends, no social life, and no way to meet anyone irl, I no longer go to public school. My ex step mother was an obvious drug addict, and my father started ignoring me years ago.

No one cares about how I feel or what I think. When I cried my father told me to shut up or he would kill me. 

My father claims to be an angel and that he has a ""special purpose"", he says to never betray him or I'll die alone, because he's all I've got, and that my biological mother doesn't care about me. Everytime they fought in front of us it was somehow my fault. Even if it was about my ex step mother's drugs. 

Everyone thinks I'm creepy, I think I'm ugly and stupid, even though I've been told that I'm cute, I don't believe it. I don't believe or trust anyone anymore. 

 I wish it would get better or I had some one to rely on that would tell me it's okay, but I don't. There is honestly no way out, I have no money to move out, I can't tell anyone, or they will call CPS again. I think Im just going to kill myself.",General_disorder

"its not  what normally happens to everybody, first off i have this weird habit/obsession of writing everything down in my notes app i once tried to write them down in a book but i stopped when i filled an entire book with it. it started when i was consuming a lot of media content such as youtube Netflix and i didn't wanted to forget about checking something out when i didn't have the time so i used to write down title of the video or whatever i wanted to look up ,, slowly i started writing activities i wanted to do that day like exercise or sketching. sometimes i write an entire thought in a whole sentence but its mostly words and sometimes gibberish that only i can understand.

this all started when i was around 17 and now im 19 still struggling with this. 

the urge to write down something isn't always strong but once its triggered i can't help it really i keep writing things that are realated to things for eg. if i write down a name of a musician I'll keep writing other musicians that have a similar vibe. 

its like im hoarding every thought that pops into my head by writing it down 

i researched about what illness this possibly  could be and it could be hypergraphia but its mostly a symptom of temporal lobe epilepsy. ( source: wikipedia)

which i dont really know if i have? I dont understand what epilepsy is to be honest.

so the writing part however doesn't bother me much but its when i do get a quick thought that i forget in a moment  i spend hours , an entire day to almost week  trying to remember it while being extremely detached from my environment and being very irritated and angry for no reason it had ruined good moments of my life for example id just be sitting and talking to my fam about something and if suddenly forget a thought that had just popped into my mind i could really get into arguments with them. go to my room ,, try everything to remember it but then i end up forgetting about every other thing i was previously thinking about and just keep feeling that feeling that ""im missing something"" even if i try to move on and do something else.
i become really detached from real life. i stop paying attention to real life and myself.

"for some background iâ€™m 19 years old, female, and started showing severe symptoms at 17. before this i dealt with occasional depression episodes and anxiety and i thought that was bad. then i went to college and mentally deteriorated. my diagnosisâ€™s are bipolar, borderline, ocd, and panic disorder. the things that effect me the most would be my bipolar and ocd. 

everytime i think iâ€™m getting better it always gets worse. iâ€™m now 2 years behind in college due to having to get treatment and my symptoms stopping me from doing work well. currently my ocd surrounds my health and itâ€™s so bad that it is constantly on my mind. every where i go i have to check my blood levels, pulse, color of skin, you name it. 

it is so exhausting to constantly be dealing with symptoms of serious chronic mental illness especially when most people around you canâ€™t even comprehend that. i donâ€™t know how i am going to do this for the rest of my life. i am trying to do my best, take my meds, iâ€™m sober now but nothing is really helping.

I made myself to stay calm and polite but I was completely powerless in that situation. The ER doctor discharged me after an hour. Now I owe a huge hospital bill I can't pay. 

I'm trying to talk about how upsetting this was to my family and they just say that those people just wanted to help or were just doing their jobs. I understand that, but now I don't think I'll ever feel safe calling a crisis hotline again.

"Hello, and thanks for clicking. 

So I started dating a girl about 7 months ago, so now we're slowly getting into that phase where our truer selves starts to show, and I'm also in the military and stationed across the US. Start off by saying:
     I love this woman tremendously, and I know she loves me just as much.


My problem is, along with the new time difference (am currently on a mission further away from her. )and the distance between us, we've been running into alot of snags. We're both upset and distraught at the situation, but we're trying. I'm in the military and have been for a long time, so it's like a part of life for me. 

     I try to be very understanding and supportive for her because I know it's hard, but anytime I try and help her or give her tips or anything she just gets frustrated and shuts down. 


    This morning I gave her the ""I can't control everything that happens to me, but i can control how I react to it."" And she took that as ""Dont be sad? Why didnt i think of that?"" And blew up and said basically a bunch of pity party and stuff that was supposed to make me feel guilty and was just overall toxic. 

Now in a normal relationship I tend to back myself up in an argument, but with her I've made it a point to either use my kiddie gloves or have just altogether backed down. (Not that i believe arguments are a competitive thing, I just try and make my point.) 
  
     Anyways, with her I've pretty much let her walk all over me when shes upset because I don't want her to do anything to her or feel any type of negative way because I genuinely don't think she can handle it. 

   We had one argument where I was trying very hard to emphasize that I thought she was still a good person and that I am not trying to make her feel shitty and I was convinced she was going to kill herself afterwards. 

   I'm at my wits end here, I can't let her keep trying to guilt trip me anytime she deems it necessary, or constantly feel like I'm walking on egg shells. I am starting to feel like I'm trapped because of her, and I'm not sure if it's her or the illness and I'm trying to be understanding but I can't continuously keep doing shit like this. 

   Any one have any sort of advice or perspective? If it wasn't for her already established illness, I would have taken these red flags and bailed. But I don't want her to live a life where it's dominated by her mental illness and I know that I can be the man she deserves, but her demons keep spitting in my face.",General_disorder

They happen so often, the lines between what I am, and what consumes me are becoming blurred. And sometimes it scares me.


I don't even know who I am. What I am. I'm too self aware. I know that much. I question every thought I have, and the reason behind its existence. Every action. Every event. I have a crippling hero complex. I guess its the only way that I can deal with the fact that for most of my life I've been the victim. I feel like I manipulate people a lot, without even realising what I'm doing. I have to plan everything, down to my facial expressions. My reactions. I feel subhuman. If a situation that I haven't planned for arises, I don't know how to react.


 Sometimes I just want to wallow in my pain. Let it consume me. Sometimes I wish to become jaded, like the people who hurt me. I want release. I want to feel. I want to stop being such a horrible, self pitying person. I can't even reinforce a single boundary. The word ""no"" makes me quake with fear as soon as it leaves my lips. I am a coward, through and through.  When I do manage to speak up, it's never for myself, and it ends in tears. For me anyway. I don't know how to explain how I feel much. Nobody understands. Even if I could get therapy, I'm scared I would just manipulate the therapist into believing I'm not a shitty person like I do with everyone else.


I want to scream. I want to be angry. But I don't feel like I have enough reason. Enough justification. I shouldn't be angry I've forgiven them all. I want to smash my head against the wall until my brain falls out. I want to gnaw the skin off my bones, and scream and scream and scream. I want to set myself on fire, and watch as I return to the ashes i was forged from, watch my skin crackle and pop. I think I'm angry at myself. About what I did. About what I didn't do. I just want to be free from it all. I want justification for the ways I want to feel. I'm sick and tired of it all. I want it to go away.


 But I can never let it go. All I know is how to be sick. I seek it out, doing things to make myself worse even if it's unintentional. I do it subconsciously now. I've never felt safe. Never felt anything other than fear. I have to be good. I have to smile. I need to look neat, tidy, and perfect, with a perfect smile plastered on my face. I can't be bad. Can't break the rules. I have to laugh and smile and pretend it's all okay. Or everyone is going to leave me again. They'll leave me, and everything will go wrong. People will get hurt. It's always my fault. I don't deserve the release I so desperately crave. I'm not allowed to be anything other than perfect.


I don't want to be angry. I don't want to be like them. I don't want to hurt people. At least that's what I tell myself. I smile so everyone else can. I laugh so they don't get worried. They think I'm better. When I don't smile, they talk about me in hushed whispers behind my back. They think I'm oblivious. But I'm not. I have to be okay so they don't worry about me. We have more important things to be concerned about.


[TW] I want to hurt myself a lot. But I can't even do that right. I bite my lips until they bleed, tear the skin off off them in an attempt to keep it discreet. I want to take a knife, and slice up my face, disfiguring the monster who haunts me in the mirror. Sometimes I long for death. I wonder what it would be like. To finally be free. For it to all be gone. I feel torn. Like I'm so many people at once. Maybe it's where I'm trying to live up to everyones expectations of me. I don't know what I want. Maybe I never will.


I feel like I'm so many people at once. I'm a child. The one I never got to be. I'm the adult I've always had to be. The rebellious teen, the little girl who's just wishing for someone, anyone  to save her, longing for something she can't have.  I'm happy but scared,  I'm angry but calm I'm everything and nothing at the same time. It's so loud and I can't think, my head is filled with all these sounds, but it's silent, and the silence is almost deafening, causing my ears to bleed. I want to scream. I feel like I'm everything and nothing all at once, a brilliant blur of pain, survival and hope.

And sometimes I'm not. Sometimes I can't even think. It's like I'm sleeping. It's like I'm blissfully unaware of it all. I can function, barley, but I can. I long to help people. All I want is to make everyone smile. Its who I strive to be. Someone who can make everyone smile. A beacon of hope. I want to make everything okay. I don't want anyone to hurt. I want to take all of the pain away. Even if that means I get hurt in the process. It doesn't matter. As long as I can save everyone else I don't matter. I feel genuine. Like I'm not lying. Until after it fades, and I'm sucked back to reality. I realise how manipulative my behaviour is. And the cycle begins again. The long torturous cycle I've been stuck in since birth. 


I'm stuck in my head. A prison forged of bone and flesh which proves to be inescapable. After everything I went through, all of the battles I fought, all the damage inflicted by others, everything I survived, it turns out that it was all in vain. I was the person who caused the most damage to myself. I did this. And now im going to have to live with it.",General_disorder
I usually donâ€™t vent to people until it gets really bad.

"Hi, 

I apologized in advance if I do come off a bit ignorant as this is very new to me. 

So, my (29/F) girlfriendâ€™s (27/F) niece (24/F) has been baker acted before and she seems like she may possibly be bipolar, not sure. I have only hung out with her three times. My girlfriendâ€™s family took her in because her nieceâ€™s mom would have put her in a mental hospital, so they wanted to see if they are able to help as she needs to be watched over 24/7 by someone.

Out of the three times that I hung out with her, she seems extremely inconsiderate and uses her tears and temper tantrum to get her way when people do not give her what she wants. She is medicated. 

My girlfriend and her family are way too nice to go against any of her request or just too tired to deal with the temper tantrum that will follow after refusing.

I told my girlfriend and her mom that her niece needs professional help and that they canâ€™t say yes to everything because they fear she is going to throw a fit. I think that may be reinforcing negative behavior and setting her back

In my opinion, she seems to come off narcissistic and a manipulator. I donâ€™t think because you have a mental illness that justifies you being an asshole. Am I wrong to think this way?

Again, sorry I do not mean to come off being inconsiderate and ignorant.",General_disorder
"So a couple of months ago I started to remember situation in a mildly exaggerated way. Specifically a way that makes me apear rude or bad when I wasn't for example. 

I started to remember situations that happened years ago and only remember the part where I was rough with someone even tho it was justified. 

For example, I remember hitting someone in high school and completely forget the fact that he's the one who started bullying me, and even tho I was defending myself, I still feel a lot of guilt and shame. 

It first starts with remembering something that I did, then slowly adding details that never actually happened, making it worse and catastrophizing the situation, or forgetting parts of the story that justified my actions. 

This is gotten a lot worse lately where suddenly out of nowhere I feel an incredible amount of guilt especially when I'm alone at night, and I don't know the cause of guilt so I try to find a reason and that's when I start remember doing awful thing to people (literally ki**ing, ra*ing ppl) and I start feeling suicidal because of it, it's just devastating, and when I try remembering details like the day or place where I did such things, I realize it's really nothing and I didn't do any of it, but the guilt stays. 

Late at night I check if the door is closed multiple times, because I'm scared something or someone might enter and I constantly feel watched and chased, and I feel like having thaughts that aren't actually mine, it's like talking with someone inside your head. 

Sometimes I start to shake but I don't know if it's out of fear or something else. 

It's really hard for me to sleep or to live a normal life now, because I'm constantly feeling like an awful person that needs to be a punished and a danger to his loved ones. So I'm literally constantly thinking about suicide, I got so suicidal once that I prepared a rope. 

I made an appointment with a psychiatrist, but I'm really nervous, I feel like I'm going to confess my crimes to him or hurt him and he's going to call the police me or something.

For example, on one of these days, I wrote a file on my computer detailing how I would kill any given person I know. Like graphic details. I read it a few days later and just thought ""wtf?! Why would I write this?"". I don't want to be a monster, but honestly I have no idea where my life is headed. First I thought I was gonna be a programmer, then I thought I was gonna be a murderer, now I don't even know. I just want this journey of suffering to be over!",General_disorder
"Is something wrong with me or is it everyone else? Also why should I care? Over the past 6-7 years people have gradually started seeing me differently even though I feel like I haven't changed. My age range is 20-25 and I am male. 

The biggest thing probably because of the prevalence is my social activity. I am extremely solitary. In fact because I have struggled to start working a job consistently I may not even leave the house for up to a month or two sometimes and then when I do it is usually something that I have to do. I just don't really care to interact with anyone and most social activities don't interest me. Then according to other people especially my family I am distant and inexpressive most of the time even if I feel fine. People will always ask me if something is wrong because I will not be as excited as them or something but usually nothing is wrong. People also point out that I avoid eye contact and that I pace back and forth. I sometimes laugh at things that people consider upsetting or sad but I have a weird sense of humor. Apparently I also misinterpret people's statements into insults or negative things about me sometimes. 

Sometimes due to video games I will build ""friendships"" online with people but I end up disappearing from them completely because it becomes too close and too much energy spent. 

I don't think I am depressed because I still enjoy my hobbies and I never really think about any self-harm/suicide. I still find things funny within my range of humor. If I compare myself to someone else I do think I struggle with motivation though. 

Another thing people will do is make comments about me wearing the same clothes all the time. This is true I wear the same couple shirts and shorts/pants all the time but I didn't think it was considered weird until people started telling me (not that I care though). 

Everything I stated above is from what other people tell me and I guess I never seemed to notice them until they were pointed out but I'm still confused on if those traits are ""weird"". I feel like everyone else are AI or something because of how so many people try to conform to each other. 

I have zero interest in romantic relationships and not much in sexual activities. 

Generally I don't have any similar interests with people except for maybe sports which is more of a small talk thing to me if I have to have a conversation. All of my other interests most people seem to find them weird or unusual. Philosophy and Astronomy being the more normal ones and Cryptozoology, Parapsychology, Ufology, Mythology, Paranormal Phenomena and ""conspiracy theories"". I do like video games which a lot of people also like. 

I have never had any social media and I never plan to. I hate having my picture taken or even my voice recorded because I don't want it to end up online. I also refuse to talk to the Amazon and Google things. I also pretty consistently feel something watching me from behind my back when I am alone. It feels like if you knew someone was watching you from behind. Sometimes it is so bad that I think someone or something is with me and I will have intense fear to open my bedroom door for example. It only happens when I'm alone and around people I feel everyone constantly staring at me even when they aren't. I don't feel them judging me but that they hate me or something even family. I don't like mirrors because it worries me that I will see whatever I feel behind me especially in the dark. I have frequent nightmares which doesn't help. When I need to go outside for something if there are neighbors I wait until they are gone unless it is very important and sometimes if I see a strange car parked or following me for a while the thought of them spying on me comes to mind. I consider it to be the government or police because I tend to have a lot of beliefs and opinions that would make me a target of the government and deep state. The only other thing that would make sense are extraterrestrials because hardly anyone knows who I am.

The last thing I can think of is that while I have never had a hallucination I do tend to hear things like voices and see things but from a real sound or object. Examples would be hearing whispering from my breathing or the wind or thinking I see a person watching me from outside when it is just a mailbox or shadow. One time there was a wad of shopping bags hanging on my pantry door and it scared me because I thought it was a head. 

Some of my beliefs and opinions people say are delusional but even when I prove it to them they don't budge. I assume they are willfully ignorant. 

Well sorry for writing an essay but at this point because I don't remember how I used to be before high school I feel like if I have changed then maybe I am an entirely different person and then I start to question reality.",General_disorder

"I have now racked up $6,000 in medical bills since last October after an inpatient stay in the psych unit, and 2 outpatient therapy programs. Iâ€™m not sure if more will be added to this amount. This cost is AFTER my insurance coverage. Recently, $3,000 got added to the balance and I received notice that they needed to increase my monthly payment from $200 to $300, because $200 â€œwas too low of an amount and itâ€™s hospital policy that you have to pay more when your balance is higher.â€ I currently make $20,000 a year. I am working part time at $18 an hour because I canâ€™t handle full time work with my mental health right now. I live paycheck to paycheck and now the hospital is asking me for more money. I explained to them on the phone that I couldnâ€™t afford to pay more. They told me I may be eligible for charity assistance and they would send me an application in the mail. 

Today I received the paper bill in the mail for $3,000 and a separate letter asking for a generous DONATION to the hospital because they are a research and teaching hospital. 

I am in a fucking cycle of medical debt and this hospital has the audacity to ask me for a donation when I am $6K in the hole? I was expecting a letter to apply for financial assistance, not get asked for more money.

"My mother has shown signs of bi polar disorder my entire life. I have memories of her manic and depressive episodes all through out my childhood. I just didn't know the words for them until I was an adult. 
The past two years her manic episodes have become much much worse.
I dont know if you would call it a manic episode or a full blown psychotic break down 
But at one point she was paranoid, thought our entire family wanted to kill her, was constantly accusing us of horrible things and even told me she was thinking of ending her life. 
That sounds pretty drastic to me, you would think that when I called the police for help they would have done something. But they didn't. (As soon as they showed up she started acting calm and denied everything that happened) 
I also tried calling the suicide hotline, which was completely useless. They gave me no information or advice on how to handle this situation. (This was about a year ago) 
This time around my mom is not acting as scary but is still having very clear signs of mania. Her mother and sister are both diagnosed with bi polar disorder too.

"Hi all

TLDR is basically the title, but essentially SIL has mentioned her desire to kill people and alluded to shooting her family, while pressing us to come back to her house to do psychedelics with her. 

Okay, here it goes:

So my partner and I live on the East coast, but we are visiting the West coast for his cousinâ€™s wedding. His parents (also East Coast residents) are also here visiting for the same amount of time. His sister, meanwhile has been a resident in this town for a while now. 

I was excited to really get to spend time with her, but it is quite evident she is not doing well. I know sheâ€™s been diagnosed with bipolar 2, and based on this experience, I am certain she is not doing anything to help treat it, be it therapy or medication, or anything at all. 

We spent time with her last night, and she was so manic. To the point where she was talking at us a mile a minute, her eyes were massive and unblinking, and she was just saying the worst stuff â€” telling my partner he needed to help her financially because she was preparing for their mother to die in the next year (she is not the epitome of health, but sheâ€™s certainly not on her deathbed), and how they have less than 5 years with their dad (very much not true), and how is going to abandon their mom and sheâ€™ll be homeless, so on and so on, you get the idea. 

Then she starts going on about how she has bought, or maybe is going to buy guns, and sheâ€™s training her dog to kill people. She not-so-vaguely alluded to pushing her mother down the stairs and shooting her dad, and then she starts threatening us because we are not staying longer and we donâ€™t ever see her. Then, she tells us she needs us to come back to her home to do mushrooms with her. 

My partner was so freaked, he just froze up and shut down. I tried to (unsuccessfully) gently steer the conversation into lighter topics, or topics which would pull her out of this violent mindset. And then we managed to extract ourselves from the situation. 

When we finally got back to the hotel, my partner was so freaked out, he called his parents to have an emergency meeting at 1:30 am. I wanted to give them their space to talk candidly, so I stayed in the hotel room. My partner said they discussed getting her some immediate help, but I donâ€™t know what they can do, or what exactly they discussed. 

My concern is we have to attend this wedding today. I am worried she is going to continue in this way today, and Iâ€™m concerned for her reputation amongst their family, but Iâ€™m also concerned for our safety. She is so adamant that we go back to her home with her, and frankly, I donâ€™t feel safe or comfortable doing so. But I am afraid of triggering her rage, because I donâ€™t think sheâ€™ll take it well. Furthermore, I donâ€™t want her to feel more alienated from us because she clearly needs help and a support system. 

How do we safely navigate this over the next two days (the wedding and the following day)?

"Iâ€™ve decided Iâ€™m going to stop therapy 
I quit, I give up, Im throwing in the towel, This is where I draw the line. Iâ€™ve had enough. 
No one Can say i didnâ€™t try 
Because i tried for fucking years. 

I tired and tried and tried but only kept failing just to end up in the same fucking place if not worse just now more self aware of how many issues I have, how deep in shit I am, I just now know thereâ€™s terminology to the actions Im programed to do. I understand the function of my illness. 
I now just consciously ruin my life. 
The only difference is Iâ€™m just less self destructive about it now. 

Ive learned itâ€™s easier to stop fighting and just lay motionless. Itâ€™s easier to just shut down than to do somthing about it. Iâ€™ve tried putting up a fight and that didnâ€™t work for me so now Iâ€™m just gonna do the opposite. 

Why do anything at all if nothing will change or go anywhere. 

Iâ€™m no longer going to attempt to Kill my self unless Iâ€™m certain Iâ€™ll succeed. Im done getting hospitalized for doing stupid shit. Im done being called an attention seeker. Im just going to do my best to disappear from everyoneâ€™s lifeâ€™s. So no one has to deal with me and I donâ€™t have to deal with them. 

Im done 
Im done talking about issues and shit that wonâ€™t be solve or will just repeat itself. Itâ€™s getting old and redundant. 
I hate hearing myself talk. 
They Wonâ€™t be solved because I will not solve them 
Im not gonna put in that effort anymore. 
I have no will to do so and I donâ€™t care anymore 
I donâ€™t wanna talk about shit anymore 

Iâ€™ve grown tired of everything and everyone 
Iâ€™ve come to hate talking to others about myself. 
Iâ€™ve grown to hate having company and people in my world. They always fuck me over. 
Iâ€™ve grown to hate the same stupid bullshit they all tell me. Iâ€™m not getting the comfort I desire. 

So I want to be left alone 
I want nothing to do with anyone 
I donâ€™t want to talk to anyone, I donâ€™t want anyone near me. Just leave me the fuck alone. Let me be. Let me end up where Ill end up. Im just gonna stop wasting time on this shit. Itâ€™s truly been a waste of time.

"  This entire situation is probably selfish of me and I feel guilty about it, but I no longer have anyone to tell and I am desperate for someone to hear me. The main reason why I am posting it on here is because a lot of my reasoning for this entire situation i based off of symptoms of my mental disorders and I could probably look crazy to people who don't understand that. 


 This morning I woke up to a text from the person who I talk to more than anyone else. He said that he will be gone for a bit and he asked me not to talk shit this time while he's gone. The backstory behind this is that we had an extremely toxic relationship with each other at one point and I exposed him online for horrible things and crimes he has done to other people (that he literally told me he did, that I had evidence of and that he'd already been reported for) and was questioned and yelled at until I cried by police the next day. Many things that he has done to me is considered emotional abuse. He has lead me on and used me to cheat on other people with, whenever I didn't even understand the situation. I know it sounds crazy that I still speak to him. I just feel so permanently empty when I don't, to the point where it almost feels like life or death sometimes. 

 Lately things between have been  healthy after we hadn't been speaking for a few months and started up again. We haven't had any arguments, he hasn't done anything remotely abusive and he's shown genuine kindness and understanding towards me again. Just like how it used to be. He truly seems to understand me in a way that other people don't.  The problem is that I am not significant at all in his life. I am just some girl out of all the other girls. Even if he tries to pretend like I am more, I know it's a lie. He used to admit to leading me on. To me he is everything. My every waking thought is about him and he doesn't even realize. I don't want him to. 


  I don't know where he is going or when he will be back but I am trying to hold in my tears. I don't know what to do about this relationship in it's entirety. I am not interested in speaking to anyone else in  any way. Anything besides him feels dull and boring. I can't describe the pain that I am in over this.",General_disorder
"this may be a bug triggering so i just wanted to put a warning here. 


so a little bit of backstory here, my grandad has always been a bit of a narcissist. he would always come round our house to visit us and just complain, he once called my sister a spoiled fucking brat because she got this teddy for christmas. there are a lot of other instances they are really messed up but whenever i tried to tell my dad about it, he would just play it off as â€˜oh its just his humour.â€™ now i sort of understand as my grandad raised my dad and hes used to it but when hes denying his own children and minimising the problem it almost makes me feel like im making it up ? ever since i was little he would do stuff like this, but he would also be really weird. like when he would hug me he would reach down to my ass or squeeze me so hard to could feel and visibly see my tits. also things like i would say â€˜excuse meâ€™ and he would wink at me and smack my ass as i walked by. i feel so disgusting whenever he touches me.  ive always been really uncomfortable about it and hes been doing it to me ever since i was little. i never thought much of it because i had told him to stop before or why he would touch me weirdly and he would just say things like its him showing his love towards me, or â€˜thats just what grandads doâ€™. ive always been really confused as i told my friend about it, and she thinks itâ€™s definitely not normal. apparently he has made comments to my mum to like â€˜oh if only you werenâ€™t marriedâ€™ or weird stuff like that. hes just touched me weird and made pedophile like comments my entire life. ive only just realised this and how it isnt normal. ive never liked people touching me and always get really uncomfortable around men because of him.",General_disorder
"I know it's long but please read. 

When I was a child my mother was often a overworked single mother. She was there, but not there. We were friends, but not emotionally connected. I could tell her everything, but I was never really emotionally supported. Emotionally neglected if you will. Screamed at because of my undiagnosed autism, constantly feeling worthless/useless/I couldn't do anything right. She wanted so much for me and burdened me because of that, therefore I became the burden as she wanted to ""fix"" someone who wasn't broken. My bio dad didn't want me, alcoholic, moved out by the time I was nine, last visit when I was 13. Narcissist. 

Anyway, I struggled a lot with undiagnosed autism, diagnosed adhd, depression from what I can tell in my paperwork. Anger. I was impossible to handle and eventually felt like a broken toy.

After my mom moved out and left me at the old house alone, she comes every 2 weeks to drop off groceries. It's lonely here. 

A few months ago after I found out about the autism, I had a episode in front of a friend with DID and they mentioned the similarities. I sat down and started grinding gears. Things clicked. I mentioned it to my therapist who also specializes in it. I've been stuck in a disassociative loop for about...6 months since I found this out. I have seemingly struck a nerve inside my brain that made it shut down. I've begun having headspace visions of a shadow man in an apartment(?), me in what seems to be my dads Buick, whatever. It always makes me flinch and panic. I've always been unsettled by cisgender men and I talked to men online much too young. Whatever else. My DID manifests a bit differently than what I've heard and read about, although I could be interpreting theirs wrong. My long lost childhood is coming back to me in splotches, while other patches of my memory fade away for the time being. I did have a evaluation this month, but chose to forgo speaking to them about it as we are nervous about outsiders knowing, especially being forced to go on pills. I'm smoking a lot of weed these days to stay level headed.

But the bottom line is I feel like I'm going nuts. Everyone treats me like I'm fabricating this entire thing for attention or something. Tells me my childhood being hidden away somewhere, slowly being uncovered, is because of dysphoria. That I'm blaming my father for everything and it's unfair to (I never did.) My therapist even said DID develops in childhood when I've read it commonly manifests at 16, which is when i had a huge change in symptoms, intensity, and personality. That shadow man is not real.

I feel so invalidated, scared, and alone. I don't know what's real or what's fake anymore. And I do not know what to do. I keep trying to convince myself that I'm delusional and insane for believing all of this. I just need someone to tell me I'm not crazy, that I'm not alone here. We finally we admitted we needed more supported living and help to ourselves and our mom today. But until then, we're trapped here.  - David",General_disorder
"Iâ€™m a thirty year old male and Iâ€™ve had mental health problems my entire life. I had OCD and depression since I was three or four; this went untreated until adulthood. When I was 21 I developed bipolar disorder (bipolar 2). I also have severe social anxiety and panic attacks. I didnâ€™t get diagnosed and treated until I was 24. 

I have a lot of symptoms with my issues. The one that is most frustrating to deal with is my issues with hearing. I had audio hallucinations and I can also interpret other sounds like voices, for instance the constant noise like a shower can sound like people arguing. 

Before I was medicated I would hear voices talking about me and insulting me almost all day. I heard it constantly while in the public, but through the walls at home. Because I was distressed and looked scared I was also targeted by the public where I would be insulted constantly where ever I went. Random people would say things any and everywhere I went. The problem is it was almost never in my face, it was always in passing so it blended in with my voices in my head. This ruined my life as I was not able to have any hobbies, work very long, or have anything to do with the public, let alone trust anybody. Iâ€™ve stayed to myself for the most part for the last nine years.

I know I heard voices and people also insulted me constantly and I found it extremely confusing. The most confusing thing is that people would act normal as if nothing happened. I couldnâ€™t hold a job for more than a few months because I would be insulted by customers and coworkers sometimes blatantly. There were a handful of times I confronted people but vast majority of the time I pretended like nothing happened. At first I was furious and it took a lot to hold back rage. After a while I stopped getting angry when insulted and any time I do I became good at repressing those emotions. I told myself, â€œ I had to not respond to anything I hear in order to work and be in publicâ€, I also didnâ€™t want to go to jail for an altercation and make my life even worse. Besides, I knew mentally ill people who were constantly into it with everyone around them and basically homeless and I didnâ€™t want to end up like them. I also never told anyone but my mom and mental health professionals about my mental illness because I donâ€™t trust anyone else with that information. 

There were times that I very clearly heard people insult me to my face and I still ignored it as if nothing happened, I will even remain nice to people after insulting me. I think I have an intense need to be normal and accepted by people that I am willing to live with them mistreating me. I am also afraid of confronting someone and getting it wrong. One time I yelled at a manager because I thought he said something about me but he was actually joking with a coworker. After that I was so embarrassed I quit. I am also afraid of making a scene so when Iâ€™ve confronted people it was always when they were alone just in case they didnâ€™t say it so I didnâ€™t look crazy. 

Now, after years of being medicated, have a stable-ish job, and liking my role I am having a similar problem. I hear people insulting me everywhere I go not as bad as before but still enough. The problem is I hear things when people are around and sometimes when they arenâ€™t. I think Iâ€™ve heard my manager insult me twice and a supervisor insult me as well and it upset me enough that I thought I was going to have to go to jail. Iâ€™ve thought about how dumb that would be, so Iâ€™m going to stick with words. I do want to keep my job and I am transferring to nights so I can go to college during the day so I might not even work with these people anymore, which may not necessarily solve my problem, but itâ€™s a plus. However, I feel like an idiot because of the amount of trauma I put myself through. I could have stood up for myself and gained self esteem, but instead I allowed people to abuse me.",General_disorder
"i'm already diagnosed with so many things but i experience so many other symptoms as well and i hate it. especially the fact i feel like there are fictional characters in my head.

i've wrote about this so, SO many times and i still don't have an answer (that is, how to make the characters go away or at least make it easier to live with). mental health professionals haven't been able to help me and i doubt anyone will be able to.

sometimes i do wish there was a label for it so i could find people who experience the same thing but it's such a weird and uncommon experience it'd be extremely difficult to find anyone who truly relates and could give me actual advice.

as much as i want them to go away, i think i'm starting to accept them as something i'll just have to live with for the rest of my life. and i hate it. i don't want to live with them but i don't have a choice. i don't know what to do though because it keeps getting worse and no one can help me. i can't function at all and they're a big reason for that (i mean, it's a bit difficult to do things when you constantly feel like you're being watched by fictional characters in your head).

even if i had a term to describe it, it'd still be such a specific version of it that i'd feel like i would have to explain it in depth every single time so the label wouldn't make a difference at all. it feels like an extreme version of maladaptive daydreaming that was caused by extreme trauma i've experienced throughout my entire life but reached a point where it feels like i'm delusional because the characters feel so real that i genuinely believe they exist in my head (and the whole being watched and having my thoughts listened to thing) and i don't have control over them, but they never take control of me and only talk to me occasionally but it's still all in my head. but also mix it with ocd and extreme dissociation.

some of them are there to protect me, some are there to judge me, some are there just because. i cannot fully be in reality. i can't take this anymore. my therapist told me she thinks they're emotional parts of me (structural dissociation), but that does not tell me how to make it better.

the worst part is that it sounds ridiculous. i know most people wouldn't believe me if i explained it. i don't know where i'm supposed to talk about it. i just want help. but apparently that's too much to ask for.",General_disorder

"So my therapist has suggested that I should consider asking my psychiatrist for a referral for Ketamine treatment for suicidal ideation. This is the second therapist to make this same suggestion in less than a year. One of the problems that I have going on is a significant non suicidal mutilation urge/impulse and I have heard that Ketamine can cause hallucinations. So, my main hesitation in all of this is that it comes off as potentially incredibly dangerous to be hallucinating during a possible episode. Has anyone here been prescribed ketamine before? And if so what were your experiences either positive or negative? Any experiences would be helpful. Thanks.",General_disorder
"About 6 years ago (14 at the time) I experienced medical trauma (internal bleeding to keep it short) which fucked with my brain really hardâ€”gonna try to keep it short but I lost the ability to experience pleasure for so long after, cutting off all my friends, dropping all my hobbies, I even stopped listening to music because it brought me no pleasure. I spent almost all of this time incredibly depressed until I started taking antidepressants (selegeline) and almost instantly started thinking normally again (finally felt like I was at the center of my life again after just a few weeksâ€”I also stopped taking them after about two months and still felt free of my depression). Since then Iâ€™ve noticed drastic personality changes such as being incredibly impulsive with medication (I got into the habit of taking almost a 6th of my Xanax prescription every time I went out and would mix it with alcohol/opioids/both on other nightsâ€”at the worst of my depression I would debate for a while on whether or not I should take a singular pill), incredibly impulsive with sex (putting responsibilities to the side and spending hours with my s/o even when I wasnâ€™t really in the mood and not being able to resist rubbing one out even after going multiple timesâ€”sounds like it could be normal but my drive to do it feels incredibly/abnormally intense), feelings of grandiosity/being better than others (this one is a bit harder to explain but all my drive to do things now feels like itâ€™s derived from me needing to be/stay above others, or thinking about things like â€œonly I would be able toâ€¦â€, feeling like Iâ€™m better than the people around me, feeling like im the center of attention, and an overall lack of gratefulness for the things I have), disregard for others (again this one is hard to explain but recently my actions have stemmed almost entirely from my wants/desires instead of how I know I should actâ€”pretty much I act only thinking about myself), lack of motivation to do important things (skipping all my classes, taking responsibilities super lightly, being late, having impulsive actions get in the way of responsibilities). 

Thereâ€™s just a bunch of things like this Iâ€™ve been noticing and I hate the person Iâ€™m becoming so much but I feel like it canâ€™t be any other way. I would sometimes experience some of what I described before starting the medication but now I experience them nearly all the time and much, much more intensely. I just feel like such a scum/POS for the way I act/think but I feel like I canâ€™t really do anything about it. I know these things sound normal to an extent and I could just be a genuinely bad person but I really donâ€™t believe this is the person I am, when I was depressed I was insanely empathetic (this is kinda hard to explain but trying to consider multiple perspectives on everything I experienced gave me a ton of anxiety but I never wanted to approach anything ignorantly so would try to consider how others would view it). I feel like Iâ€™ve done a complete 180 as a person and while I my life has gotten exponentially better Iâ€™m starting to really hate myself (which is funny because I used to think my life was incredibly shitty but I was proud of the person I was).

"hello!! ill try to make this short and sweet so you dont have to read as much 

i've been diagnosed with typical depression and anxiety for over 4 years now, it started when i was 11. i have moved schools a whole lot, so i've found that my friendships don't really last except with one friend who i've known for 10 years. she was EXTREMELYY possessive during all of elementary, and would get super upset whenever i talked to other people (i dont hold a grudge against her for this and i still talk to her, now that she's aged she's changed)

she went homeschooled in 6th grade, basically leaving me out in the open in public school with no friends because i hadn't really socialized with anybody other than her all throughout elementary (there were little conversations and stuff, but it was limited

recently, anytime i see one of my friends talking to one of their friends or maybe responding to another person without me, i totally flip out. i flip out to the point where i have to ghost said friend for days on end because i get so mad. when i have thoughts like this i cant help but think that no one will ever truly love me like how my friends love their other friends, and i try to act over the top excited and comical to make sure they dont leave me. i try to mold myself into having qualities that their other friends have that they seem to enjoy. this makes me so extremely tired after simply texting my friends, and its even worse in real life because i haven't been myself the whole day socializing with them. its basically like playing a role all day. 

my therapist has simply said that i likely have abandonment issues, but the idea that i could (possibly) have borderline personality disorder has also come into thought. i may ask for her opinion on this when i meet her again but i dont want her to think im self-diagnosing or saying i think i have it for attention.

its not just an extreme fear of abandonment, but the depression stuff like emptiness and sh, as well as extreme mood swings. sometimes my ego is super high and then the next second it hits the floor, and my fear of abandonment gets to the point where i stalk my friends when they're playing games with other people or excessively text them when i know they're talking to someone else. ive even planned out in my head how to sabotage the friendships that my friends have with other people, and ive drafted angry texts to send friends when all they've done is laugh at someone else's joke or put them on their snapchat story. what's worse is sometimes i think all together that i should just drop everything and be by myself because its not like anyones going to like me anyways, which also leads to suicidal thoughts

sometimes i even change up my personality because i feel like i cant keep up with the crazy comedic one, so instead i try to act more like the calm reserved type. i get extremely obsessed with character stereotypes and myerrs briggs personality types, and i try to shift myself to fit whatever personality.

sorry that wasn't super short or sweet but i just kept thinking more and more things as i was writing lolz!! but thx for reading if your seeing this! it means a lot, and even writing my feelings out has helped tons :)",General_disorder
"I have this weird obsession of wanting to remove my own body parts. Just like a constant thought that keeps popping into my head. Wanting to cut off fingers, pull out my teeth, or cut out my tongue. I dont think its normal for this but I pretty much think about it daily. I think the only thing that has stopped me from going through with it is that im also afraid of blood.

"The system is fucked.

I have resources. Doctors, meds, checkups, hospital stays. I have all these things that should work. That should make some sort of difference, but they don't. All these resources don't work, and then I'm made to feel like shit because maybe it's just me. maybe I'm just not trying hard enough to get better. 

The cycle is endless.

I'm not getting better because I don't go outside &gt; but I can't go outside because I feel like the worlds going to collapse, or I'm going to be killed &gt; so maybe If I had a little help, something to take the edge off, I could go outside and get better &gt; but I can't get better because those services aren't working &gt; maybe I shouldn't rely on it and help myself instead &gt; but it's too much I can't do it alone &gt; the services aren't working &gt; I'm not trying hard enough &gt; and on, and on, and on. the cycle repeats.

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't do the simplest things. Everything I struggle with, people seem to do so effortlessly. I can't keep having my parents fork out money for services that don't do shit. 

I'm stuck in limbo. 

I have to make a choice to help myself or end it. But nothing I'm doing to help myself is working.

I want to die, but I'm terrified of death and not existing, but I can't see any other way to end all this pain.

I'm contemplating turning to drugs, just to make it easier to live.

My doctor's ""re-evaluating my diagnosis"", which is code for 'not doing shit'.

He's useless. I literally wrote a nine-page report on my history, and current problems. 18 years worth of medical history. He's done nothing. Prescribed more meds and that's it. No meds that I've used have helped me. Unless by ""help"" I mean one drug that sedated me. That's probably the best I've gotten.

I'm struggling with pressure to perform at work, I hate myself to an indescribable amount, My parents don't understand how everyday things affect me differently, My illnesses are constantly misunderstood by my family. I feel like such a failure and a pussy. Why can't I just live?

So many people online speak about having no choice. Having tried everything and finding nothing works, and seeing death as the only way out. My gut reaction to those confessions is to tell them not to do it. But I understand why now. Honestly. Tell me. If you knew you were never getting better, and this was how you were going to be forever, would you stick around?

I can't trust my body or my mind anymore. I don't know who I am and I don't know how to live. While my friends were starting uni and their lives after school, I was in a psych unit.

I canâ€™t. Why show an audience that? These people often say their spreading awareness but I whole heartedly believe you can talk about ana without posting your pro ana photos. You can discuss the emotions you felt, how it effected your life, when you decided to fight back etc without showing those photos.

Oddly enough i dont get erections as often and i feel apathy. Like as in i dont feel anything. I can still cry, feel happy, feel sad etc.. etc.. but its not as much as before. 

Im scared, did something happen? Did the antidepressant do something to me or is it my Immunosuppressive drugs Octreotide and Sirolimus? I mean i asked my dad about our families mental health heritage and he said that Schizophrenia runs in my family? Is this feeling that i feel on on-set of it? Or something else? Am i getting older?

I used to be on Klonopin when I was a teenager and that worked very well for me. I got off of it because I went through a period of time where I didn't need it. After having a baby and other things I'm just a completely nervous wreck all the time especially at night. This extreme anxiety is getting worse and it's caused my (legitimate doc diagnosed) OCD to come out full force. I am not depressed at all it's just severe anxiety. I've been trying to do everything I can via the holistic route and it helped with prob 30% of my anxiety or less.  I've come to determine I need some help and I need to be back on something but I realize Klonopin is like a huge red flag when you mention it to doctors. Doctors now a days never want to give you anything that has the risk of being addictive. I've tried so many different medicines throughout my life and they were all when I was a teenager so it's not on my recent medical record when the doc pulled it.

"Throwaway account for reasons that will soon become obvious

I (21F, if that matters?) am currently drunk off the worst cocktail I've ever tasted, so this is going to be a long post with probably a lot of typos but I am a disaster right now and I need advice.  

Last summer, I got a friend recommendation on Instagram for a guy I thought was really cute. I sent him a drunk DM in the hope that he'd wanna hook up, but he made it pretty clear he wasn't interested. I was bummed, but after a couple days I got over it and was fine. 

A few weeks later I meet a different guy on a dating app. We ended up in a relationship, but he turned out to be emotionally abusive and very very manipulative, and in January of this year I finally cut him off and tried to move on with my life. The guy that I had DM'd that summer was super inactive on social media to the point that I pretty much forgot he existed, but about a month before my ex and I broke up he started posting a bunch of stuff to his stories and such, and I started instagram stalking him. I was completely delusional and I thought that he was ""the one"", the guy that was gonna save me from my shitty situation, and I started fantasizing endlessly about him. Even after my ex and I broke up, I was still obsessed with this guy that I had never met and I was convinced that I needed to be with him.

About two months ago, I had a psychotic break ( I called the law on my ex and got scared that he was going to come after me and kill me) and I made the very stupid decision to transfer to a different university (and therefore a different city). The university that I transferred to is the same one that the guy I was obsessed with goes to. 

As I said at the beginnning I'm very drunk right now because I am so ashamed of myself but I'm struggling to really put this into words. The university I'm now attending and the degree I'm now getting were always dreams of mine-- I;ve wanted to get this degree for over five years now and growing up I always loved the city I now live in. But at the end of the day, I moved here with the knowledge in the back of my mind that the guy I was obsessed with lives here and that it's almost inevitable that I'll """"""""""by chance"""""""""""" run into him, and as I'm sitting here typing this that disgusts me.  I was in complete delusion for so long and I think that it's just now hitting me how horrible and creepy it is that I've done this, and I don't know what to do. I'm locked into a lease for the next year and I've spent most of my savings on tuition so there is literally no going back. This is one of only a few times since I saw this dude's profile that I've been ""lucid"" (if you can really call it that) and I am just so ashamed and terrified. I broke a month long streak of sobriety because I am just so disappointed in myself and I just want to crawl out of my skin and go home. 

I have a therapist in my new city, but I honestly don't think I can bring myself to tell him all of this. IN our last session, he mentioned multiple times how brave I am for talking about my past so openly and how courageous it is of me to be seeking help and I know that if I told him all of this he would lose every ounce of respect he has for me and I have no other source of care or validation right now, so selfishly I am scared to lose that. 

I'm sorry for the errors and the long-windedness, this sort of just turned into stream of consciousness but any advice or help would be much appreciated and I hope I didn't breka any of the subs rules here (if I did let me know so I can fix it)",General_disorder

"I'll start by saying I'm not asking for a diagnosis. I've had all kinds of obsessive compulsive tendencies over the years that make it almost impossible to function and I'm wondering if anyone in the OCD community will be able to relate to any of my issues. All my issues started about seven years ago and have been getting progressively worse since. I would love to know that I'm not the only one experiencing certain kinds of obsessions and compulsions. Even if what you're experiencing is similar but not the same I would love to hear about it. This is going to be a long post but I feel it's necessary to explain what I'm dealing with. Huge thanks to anyone who reads all of it!  
 
&amp;nbsp;

The first issue I have is my need to experience every possibility. For example if there was two different ways to drive somewhere it would feel impossible to decide as I would start obsessing over wanting to experience both options. Recently I've been experiencing this but with my vision. Whenever I'm doing something I want to see things in two different ways. One is with my glasses or contacts on and the other is without them. It's silly because without them my vision is very poor but it's an intrusive thought that never seems to end. Lately it's been making it impossible to function on a daily basis.

The second issue is my desire to do things be in a certain order. My brain will decide things need to be done in a very specific order and trying to do them in any other way will give me anxiety. For example if I'm going to eat sandwiches for lunch for a certain week I have to have them on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I have to eat them in that order and to add to that if I buy multiple different deli meats I have to have those in a certain order as well. It would feel ""wrong"" to do those things in any other order. This extends to many other things like having to always do things in chronological order, for example.

The third issue is my perfectionism and struggle with making decisions. I have a tendency to overthink most decisions no matter how small and I will often obsess over a decision until it ruins my entire day. I also have a lot of perfectionist traits which don't help as I always feel like I need to make the perfect decision. I care too much about small things that ultimately don't matter. The issue is that I don't realize they don't matter until later on. This becomes especially apparent when making purchasing decisions. I obsess over small differences that won't matter in the real world but I can't stop thinking about them. I often try and visualize the outcome of a decision which only makes the overthinking worse.

The fourth issue is my avoidance of certain numbers. I try to avoid even numbers whenever possible. For example if I'm making a list of items the list must be 1, 3, 5, or 7 items long. If it's an even number it won't ""feel"" right and will give me anxiety. This issue makes it harder to make written lists or do any kind of file management as my brain tells me things must be an odd number long. Also for larger collections of items I do everything I can to make them a multiple of 50 or 100. For example my music collection must have 250, 500, or 1000 songs in it. If the collection had a random number of songs in it I would be bothered by that.

The fifth issue is my obsession with the past and difficulty dealing with change. I feel like I have to do things a certain way because I did them that way in the past. Something as simple as replacing my old office chair in my room to something slightly different caused me months worth of stress and anxiety. I'm starting to get used to that change but it upset me for many months. I would be very hesitant about doing something like replacing my mattress even if it's worn out because I don't like change, good or bad. In my mind I'll constantly want to go back to doing things a certain way because that's how I did them in the past. Even when it comes to possessions like replacing a phone with a new one.

The sixth issue is something that doesn't happen that often but I thought I would mention anyway, especially because it seems very closely related to OCD. In the past I've had times where I had to perform certain compulsions over and over again. Not in the traditional sense like checking if a door is locked, but more to do with checking certain settings on a computer. I remember going through a phase where I had to check the volume level on a computer over a dozen times, even though I knew it was set a certain way. This has also happened numerous times when checking the difficulty setting on a video game. I've also had mental compulsions where I had to go over a list dozens of times in my head, but I've found that writing out 
the list fixes this issue.  

The seventh issue is my need to memorize something completely before I can move on. This makes it impossible to read a book or watch a tv show because it feels like I need to remember every single sentence or scene before I can continue with whatever I'm reading or watching. Unless I have everything completely memorized it feels almost impossible to continue with something. Remembering what happened in general in a chapter or episode isn't enough. If I try doing it that way my anxiety will stop me from continuing, and I'll be stuck in a loop of going back, and either re-reading/re-watching, or skimming over and over again. Lately I've had trouble scrolling through news articles because I always feel the need to read the headlines over and over again and basically memorize all the news stories before I can move on with the day.    

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR - I have a bunch of obsessive compulsive tendencies that started about seven years ago and have been getting progressively worse. I'm not looking for a diagnoses but rather would like to hear from people who may be experiencing similar issues. Some of my issues involve the need to experience every possibility when there are multiple options, obsession with doing things in a certain order, trouble making simple decisions and obsessing over small details, avoidance of certain numbers, obsession with my life in the past and struggle accepting change, desire to perform certain compulsions over and over again, and being obsessed with memorizing things completely before I feel like I can move on. That's just a brief summary as my issues are complex and at times hard to explain. Thanks!",General_disorder

I constantly think thoughts like ""someone is looking at you through the curtain"" and I know no one's there but my heart races i feel clammy and out of breath and overall just feel like I saw a ghost or something. I also have this about mirrors. maybe cuz they look a little like windows? ill be lying in bed or walking past one and will think ""someone is going to come out of it"" and like??? wtf no they're not that's physically not possible and i KNOW that but i still need to run away and cry. Well, at times it isn't always super clear to me that its not real but after the feeling is gone I always know it wasn't real.

This kind of stopped for a while but a few weeks ago the thoughts got bad again and now i have to have my mirrors all covered and/or turned around. I haven't opened my curtains in weeks because of it. I constantly feel like I'm being watched and occasionally I see things moving in the edge of my vision. I have to have all windows and doors locked at night. But i know its not real and google has barely got anything about people experiencing this. as soon as i mention ""paranoia"" it just talks about full-blown delusion and psychosis, which i don't have (at least i think i dont). so, has anyone else experienced this?",General_disorder
"my friend and i have talked about going to a specific place for AGES now and i found out today they went without me
i immediately got really frustrated and upset (i didnt tell them this, it was over text so they didnt see me or anything) and my first thoughts were that they hate me and never wanna hang out with me and theyre trying to avoid me because im boring and annoying and i got even more upset when they posted a picture of them with another friend. theyâ€™re obviously allowed other friends and i would never say anytjing about this to them but jesus i felt so crap i even cried
they texted me after saying they wanted to go with me and explore more which instantly made me feel fine again

"Basically as the title says. I am a lesbian, I love women romantically and physically but I need men to touch me so bad. Both sexually and in affectionate way. 

I'm guessing this is all due to fact that I was sexually abused and assulted. One of the people who abused me sexually was my father. He almost never touched me in a nonsexual manner. 

I know I am not attracted to men at all and I find sexual acts with them gross and I just don't like them overal but I still fantasize about having sex/cuddling with them because I just want to feel loved by a male. I tried to date men but I hated it and I didn't feel like myself at all. I absolutenly hated having sex with them because I find men extremely unappealing sexually. I have only positive feelings about dating women and all that.

I just wish I had a platonic male friend who would cuddle and kiss me without falling for me but that seems impossible. My ex is doing all of this for me until he finds a girlfriend (he is already looking for one) and am so scared because I crave physical affection so much it makes me suicidal if I don't have it for more than few days. 

I also crave a woman's touch but not as much since it's not as rare for me. Women in my family were always very affectionate and I can go hug my mom anytime.

"Tell me what mental disorder this is so I can educate myself about it. Or is it even a mental disorder?

I have an associate-not really a coworker as we don't work for the same company but we are often in the same professional arena-who frequently drops into almost an impersonation of some other person who we have both interacted with a few minutes ago. They adopt phrasing, mannerisms, body language, etc., in a very chameleonic fashion and it seems to last until I leave their presence.  Weeks or days later 
when I see them again they are not mimicing (intentionally  or not) the person they were mimicing when I  last saw them. I don't know if they are now using their ""own"" personality or mimicing someone else.

What is that? Some sort of multiple personality disorder? Classic schizophrenia?

"Hi,

Poor mental health over the last few years has destroyed my life. I'm trying to rebuild it and getting the help I need, but the debt I built up during my breakdown has put me in a position where it's extremely hard for me to do anything. I can barely afford the minimum payments which means the debt isn't going down and I'm struggling to have any sort of life.

Any help would be immensely appreciated and I hope everyone else who is in a bad place knows that it can get better. There are people that care and there are people that want to help you. Please reach out if you need help. I was very close to not surviving a day before I called the emergency mental health team in my area.

"I have an older brother that is in his late 40's that has been struggling with mental illness. (I forgot what he's been diagnosed with - the medical term whether its MDD or bipolar/ or a combination of both). He is currently being helped by a medical professional but not sure if he's on meds or not..... 

My question is how do you actually deal with a family member that is currently mentally ill and goes through these random bouts of rage or psychotic episodes? I'm asking because I really am struggling how to deal or react or process things. Recently still trying to deal with one of his many episodes where he's lost his temper and just went bezerk. He will go through these bouts and go off the deep end and then the next day he apologises and says he's not in the right of mind. It's not just rage, he will say things that just don't make sense or pull random things from our childhood.....some moments he will call me to ask me about something that happened years ago... 

I know we are not supposed to take what people that are going through mental illness ....I mean whatever they say/ as they are not in the correct mental space but he says and does the worst type of things - and each time my mom will tell me to ignore it because he is 'unwell'. 

I've experienced this many times - he will go through these bouts, he just goes completely mental on me - the last time it happened I was in the ER and it was something completely out of the blue. He has come to my house and screamed until the neighbours almost called the cops on us - all because of something that didn't go his way. His wife will say that she has gotten 'used' to such episodes where he just goes off on her/with the kids and then the next day its back to square one. 

Please don't be offended and I truly apologise if I'm not using the correct terms or putting it into the correct words here - I am struggling as to how to process or feel after facing such situations. Sometimes it does scare me because I do feel he is capable of hurting me - when he's doing it. The most recent one he was inches away from my face and just screaming /shouting and just non-stop abusive or just spewing hateful stuff. It would be triggered by the oddest things sometimes...... 

I just don't understand how/why or what the hell to do? Am I supposed to just stay quiet or just not react when he goes through these episodes? What's the best way to handle things - I do find myself trying to put space in between us whenever he is about to go off /or start one of his episodes (tbh I don't even know if you can even call it that or if thats the correct term to use?) I don't see him all the time but I feel like I'm on edge if when/if I see him. I can never tell which way things will go - somedays its like the best brother like old times and next- its like a complete hell.

"Trigger Warning: suicidal thoughts. This is a story I wrote about the effects of being bullied. I understand the hurt when youâ€™re the target. I know Iâ€™m not alone. Itâ€™s been many many years but I still remember the feeling. 








My friends had me come over


They called me to their room


I got up and I followed them


Said I had to leave real soon


I sat up on the bed


Like so many times before


And out they pulled a pistol


From their grandfatherâ€™s top drawer


I sat in silence shaking


Thought they were showing off


But they put it right against my head


I waited for it to go off


They laughed after it clicked


They called me names, Iâ€™m such a coward


And I swore Iâ€™d never speak to them


They were relentless in their power


Theyâ€™d find me in the hallways


They would always call me names


They would chalk it up to horseplay


Then they would do it all again


I wish that I could disappear


Get lost and not be found


Hide within my memories


And never make a sound


Am I so small and worthless?


Is it fun to see me cry?


I close my eyes and wish for death


It doesnâ€™t hurt to try


Those who think they know me


Think that Iâ€™m some kind of joke


I donâ€™t think that they know me


Or the thoughts that they provoke


Wouldnâ€™t it be funny


To just sit around at home


Slit my wrists and maybe


Iâ€™ll just write them all a poem


Iâ€™m sure that I could still write


I mean itâ€™s just two little cuts


The letters might be messy


And theyâ€™d all just say Iâ€™m nuts


Or go out with a bang


Just to have a little fun


I could end it in moment


If I could steal that fucking gun


I would get them all together


Surprise them with a call


In a second pull that trigger


Will they hear me as I fall?


Iâ€™d be dressed up for a party


As the blood dripped down my cheeks


And Iâ€™d leave each one a present


A gift for them to keep


I guess it might be funny


To be the last to laugh


To have them sit and wonder


Maybe wish to change the past",General_disorder

I'd also wake up from weird dreams. I went for professional help and I was told it's probably normal with stress.  I also was checked for a sleep disorder and I don't have that.

You refuse to see that your perceptions of people are harming those exact people, as well as the ones you *should* care about the most.

"Iâ€™m diagnosed with PTSD from other events in my life, among various co-morbid disorders that go along with it, but Iâ€™ve realised over the last few years that Iâ€™m definitely dealing with trauma from a suicide attempt I made almost five years ago. I wonâ€™t go into detail because that isnâ€™t helpful for anybody, but it was very nearly successful and the nature of it was very traumatic for myself and for my family.
Iâ€™ve been finding myself having flashbacks and dissociating because of this particular event, and Iâ€™ve realised that I am unable to deal with triggers, or conversations in depth about the specific way I tried to end my life. I find it hard to talk about because of how my emotions are around it, and also because ultimately it was a choice I made, and technically self inflicted.

"This is long but please read I am so mentally destroyed because of my therapist. 

Today's session left me feeling worthless &amp; than I was a failure and I didn't expect it from my therapist who I had so much trust in.Â 

I was talking to my therapist about being lonely. It's something I've struggled with &amp; have brought up the her before (this time though had a specific trigger). After that I told her some classes I'm planning on taking to help myself get out more (which she had told me to do) and I was looking forward to taking these classes. (Pottery, Martial Arts, Painting, etc)

It went downhill when I said the classes have to wait a few weeks due to an injury to my arm that won't allow me to participate.Â They have flexible start times, so the wait is only a few weeks. 

All of a sudden she started blaming me for feeling lonely because I was putting off these classes. I stressed to her again that it was beyond my control due to my injury but that wasn't enough.Â 

She then went on to blame me about changing my mind on college. Awhile back I mentioned thinking about it but due to many personal reasons that she has previously heard &amp; claimed to understand that college isn't possible this year due also partly to things beyond my control.Â 

I explained to her that I want to take things slow. I've had several personal tragedies this year (that she knows about) and even if I wanted college right now I'm in no mental shape to deal with that on top of my full-time job. I'm also thinking I'd perfer vocational school instead of college.

I want to take these next few months and put my life back together. I want to take life a day at a time, I want to get back to things I enjoy. I want to clean my house because it's become a mess in my depression. I want to get out and meet new people, I want to take casual classes with things that interest me without all the deadlines &amp; stress. I want to go hiking on my days off again. I want to start training again for a 5k when my arm healsâ€¦.Â 

After months of stress, of worry, and running around having to deal with every new life altering problem. I don't want to jump into a classes that I don't even want to take. I want to find myself again.Â 

She didn't understand that, she said I'm wrong &amp; that I need to go to college no matter how hard it is &amp; how expensive it is and that's the only way I'll succeed in lifeâ€¦

I left my session today is tears. It's been 7 hours since my session and I can't stop crying. I feel so hurt by the person I trusted wouldn't hurt me. I feel betrayed, I feel lost, I no longer have the support because she was my support. I don't know how to move past this.Â

"This is my first post in reddit and sorry english aint my first language. I was diagnosed with bipolar hypomania or mixed episodes like a year ago after being misdiagnosed with social anxiety and major deppression for five years. I didnt even know what bipolar was until I had a roomate that had that condition but I never even was aware if I was having high or lows. I was unaware for a while until I had a nervous breakdown a year ago and decided to go to three psychiatrists that diagnosed me as bipolar and I started taking depakote. 

In terms of relationships ive never had a girlfriend, only one time and it was long distance and it lasted a month because we both had numerous issues. Ive had a lot of casual sex with numerous partners mostly in my manic times and done numerous drugs and had risky behaviour, I just realized ive been doing this a year ago. 

So, to get to the point, Ive been trying to stop my medication and stop seeing my psychiatrist  , I know is a bad idea, three months ago which is around the same time I met this girl. When I met her through a friend We went to my place and nothing happened but then saw her two weeks later and hooked up, things started going really fast as it usually does and we were spending weekends together and going out on dates. I started getting needy and clingy and professing my â€œloveâ€ for her which she didnt correspond as she was coming out a relationship and she just wanted to hang out. So all this and the fact that I was reducing my meds was bringing up minor manic episodes at times when I would become paranoid and jealous and start pushing her away as I always do. I broke up with her the first time cause I thought we would better be friends, the I called her an hour later for her to come over. The second time was because she arrived late and then she was anxious so we made up. Third time was because I started to feel more attached and feared that I might lose her. And now the fourth time this weekend because I thought she was with some other guy which it should be cool because we only dating but I keep feeling that everyone out there is there to get me.

I went to her house with flowers and chocolates even though she blocked me and explained to her that im bipolar and although its not a excuse I like her a lot and sometimes is out of my control and I dont mean it, that I want her in my life and that I really love being with her. She said she us not a tennis ball to keep bouncing on the wal and that she is really hurt and felt like I will keep doing this all the time and she was crying and very upset with me which I understand. She said she might think it over the weekend to see if she takes me back

I honestly think she would be better off without me as Im a complete mess and I think things just might get worse, although I realized many bipolar relationships, the bipolar person is always pushing the other person away. I dont wanna keep doing this, especially not witth this girl, but she says that now she is going to be scared of anything that she says or does because I might dump her and that she will not be able to be herself. I really dont want her to feel that way, i want her to be free and not locked down on my emotional mess. I have to let her go but part of me still cares a lot about her, I just dont want to make her cry ever again or hurt her. I feel like a jerk for playing with her feelings. 

I know dropping my meds is a really bad idea but I miss my old self and wanna have a heathy relationship but im even scared of myself as im usually self centered and unaware. Never dated a girl more than three months which of course is a red flag, wanted to see if anybody else identifies or see me as a complete wacky.",General_disorder

I'd laugh, I'd be extremely happy, but after all of it has ended. I can't think, I feel emotionless. Like I'm a husk, I can listen and I know what's happening around me. Although, I can't feel anything. After a while, I do 'regain my emotions' and I can laugh, cry, be mad etc. It's like I have a battery.

"  I feel like there are two people inside my brain. I don't mean that literally, but there are two completely conflicting sides of me and I know that's normal but it just goes so deep. I feel like I have a more immature, needy, innocent little child version of myself who is trapped inside my brain. When I make hard decisions I'm not usually affected by them at all until that child completely takes over. 

I just attempted to end a toxic relationship that I was in and I didn't have any problem with doing so and had no emotions attached because I know it's what I needed to do. Though later on something in my brain completely switched and that childish version of me came through. My emotions became sadness and longing and my thoughts became things like ""Who's going to take care of me now?"", ""Nobody else is going to let me be my real self or be happy"", ""I can't make it on my own."" Though the only thing that this person actually did for me was talk to me. I couldn't even see him in person. Now I just feel the most indescribable empty feeling inside. I'm sure that I will eventually give into these thoughts and ask for him to talk to me again even though he doesn't treat me well at all. This is an ongoing problem in my life and it always happens when something is really good or when something is really bad. 

When it happens I just feel like I've been taken over by new thoughts and feelings and needs and it comes out of nowhere and I try to make it stop but it's just so strong and comforting.",General_disorder

"So Iâ€™ve never really used Reddit before but I had a really terrifying experience last night and Iâ€™ve felt really off since. I got super high last night and whatever strain my friends have makes my anxiety worse and my senses highten. as Iâ€™ve smoked with them Iâ€™ve slowly remembered parts of my childhood. It was really helping for a bit, talking to my therapist about it and he said he thought itâ€™d be good for me to keep going. I dug too deep yesterday and fell down the well. I stumbled through so many memories and traumas and was able to truly take a deep dive into looking introspectively without a barrier blocking the worst stuff. Iâ€™m kind of gaslighting myself into believing some of it was fake because I truly hope it is. Iâ€™ve never felt more out of control of my mental illness. It truly is like a parasite on my soul which has grown so big itâ€™s trying to take over and run the show, ruin my life. I thought it was not bad enough and I could manage it but last night was an eye opener. Iâ€™m terrified that these toxic thinking patterns are so engrained into me that I doubt every thought I have constantly. Without even trying. Last night was so much and Iâ€™m really overwhelmed with everything I saw and felt. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m supposed to be okay after what happened in the past, because the only way for me to keep going was to block out the bad memories. Now they keep coming back to haunt me in my intrusive thoughts. I donâ€™t know where to go from here ig and I just need some advice with healthy ways to start working through this and feeling ok until I talk to my therapist next week.",General_disorder
"I've been having a peculiar issue at sleep. I wake up completely terrified, screaming until my throat hurts and sometimes violently. Sometimes I jump of my bed and try desperately to exit my room.

It's not something that happens frequently or follows a pattern. It happens randomly, sometimes months can go by without it happening, and other times various days in a row. I honestly don't know how to deal with it because I don't know when it will happen again.

I always sleep with my door locked, it makes me feel really safe. I don't believe in paranormal things, although I do suggest myself a bit if I see some terror. Even so, when this happens to me, I don't watch or read horror stories before sleep. It just could happen any moment.

When I wake up terrified, I can't remember what I dreamed, although sometimes they're very lucid dreams. I wouldn't say those nightmares share a particular theme or are related to a trauma. As far as I know, I never suffered from any abuse that makes me remember anything horrible.

However, every time I wake up terrified, I have the feeling that someone has entered my room and is watching me. I can't say for sure who it is, I just feel someone. Sometimes I also wake up when someone knocks my door or I hear a loud noise. My mother says that whenever it happens to me, I moan or cry, and it's when she comes into my room that I wake up with horrible screams.

Sometimes I also dream that I lose my breath and wake up a little scared, although to a lesser extent than what I described above.

Does anyone know of a similar sleep disorder? How could I deal with it? I don't know if it helps much, but I've been keeping a dream diary for a long time. But like I said, I usually don't remember what I dream of when I wake up terrified.",General_disorder
"My bf of 3 years has intermittent explosive disorder and I have tried to be supportive and kind.

He used to be so kind and sweet to me and now I donâ€™t even know who the hell he is. He destroys my things, screams at me and calls me names all the time. He uses his strength and anger to intimidate me into getting what he wants, nearly every day. Iâ€™ve known him for years before we dated and he never once acted like this that Iâ€™ve seen. He used to always be so nice. He is honestly turning into a really shitty partner and I just keep finding myself wanting as far away from him as possible. He scares me and I am walking around on eggshells to keep him calm and revolving everything around him.

He used to only do this exploding shit at home but now heâ€™s starting to do it in public too. I am so embarrassed.

I probably am going to end up with PTSD from this for all I know. Idk how he can change so much from being literally perfect to whatever this is. Is it just because heâ€™s comfortable with me now or something? Why would he treat me like this if he loves me like he says?

Iâ€™ve been depressed for a while and for a few years or so Iâ€™ve been feeling very weird. Iâ€™m 16 btw and my sister has many mental and neurological problems. Iâ€™ve never been to a therapist but Iâ€™ve heard that teenagers act up so I may just be doing that.Being with my friends is hardly enjoyable anymore. Whenever Iâ€™m with them I feel degraded and it feels like theyâ€™re mocking me with everything they say. I know this isnâ€™t true because Iâ€™ve known them for 10 years and all our parents know each other. I feel like my parents hate me and wish I died sometimes but I know that they love me and care for me. My sister is borderline mentally abusive to us but Iâ€™m used to even though itâ€™s puts a lot of stress on me everyday. Peoples eyes always seem to mock me and I feel like Iâ€™m the only one who cares for my self. I truly feel like the world hates me and is against me but Iâ€™m also very grateful for being born lucky.

"Hello, my name is Sophia. I am 17 and i live in Tennessee. I have lived with my mother my entire life until i turned 13. I was taken away from her mainly because of truancy. I wasn't going to school at the time, because i lived in a really bad part of the town and the schools there were horrible. I wouldn't go to school because of my anxiety. The kids there were really violent and overall it was just a horrible environment. My aunt now has custody of me and i go to a better school.

Leading up to the point where i wasn't taken away from my mother, a lot of horrible things were going on in the background. I really want to know what is wrong with my mother. She struggles with mental illness horribly and because of that, i was neglected by her. Her neglect has caused a distance relationship between me and her and has left emotional scars on me. There is so much to type here and i'm kind of in a rush so i can't be very detailed.

These are the traits of my mom and some of the serious events that took place between me and her:

\- She would always go to the doctor because she always thought there was something wrong with her mentally and physically. 

\- she was convinced i had bipolar disorder. When i was 9, i would act up (like any other child) and she convinced me and psychiatrists i had bipolar. It's like she wanted me to be sick. I was put on medication around that age for my presumed bipolar that we later found out in my teenage years i didn't have. She was also diagnosed with bipolar, so i don't know if she wanted me to have it too?

\- when i was 8 or 9, she threatened to cut herself with a knife in front of me and my brothers. We were living with my uncle and apparently he was ""abusive"". He would always tell her to get a job but she wouldn't because she believed she wouldn't work because she was physically disabled, which she wasn't. Sure she had some knee issues but she could stand and walk fine.

\- She would send me to psychiatric facilities very often. Ive been at least 3 times. So many times i don't even remember. I was depressed at the time, but i believe it was because she was contributing to my depression.

\- She would force me to get up and do everything around the house while she just sat down all day and watched TV.

\- She took a bunch of different meditations (still does). Some for her bipolar disorder, some for her pain, etc. She took so much i remember she would have a whole basket of pill bottles.

\- At one point, she was so out of her mind that she starting having really bad hallucinations. Im not sure why. After I was taken away, she said she would see this pit of fire in her living room and that she would see all her kids fall into it. She was taken to a hospital after this and when she got out she promised me she would do better. However, she got back on all her pills and started sitting down at home all day drugged up again.

\- She told me to hit her with a broom once, so i did. She then called the police on me and they took me to a psychiatric hospital again. I kid you not.

\- My brothers don't live with her either, they live with their father. But she lets one of my brothers manipulate her and take control over her. One of my brothers who is 14, steals her money, hits and abuses her, calls her names like ""faggot"" or ""bitch"", and she still allows him to come over on the weekends. I constantly tell her not to let him stay with her, but she always makes excuses for him.

Can someone describe to me what she's struggling with and what kind of damage this could potentially leave on her kids? To this day i struggle with anxiety and depression. I feel like she has significantly contributed to it  Sorry if i didn't explain very well or go into much detail.",General_disorder

4.She made a gross lie about me touching my little sister wich I haven't and never would just so I couldn't be near her and it would seem justified even though I've done nothing wrong to her



5.she didn't tell me things just so that when CPS asked me questions I couldn't awnser we had issues with CPS and I brought in with my sister and a lady asked us questions I lied about the hitting and said I was clumsy wich isn't completely wrong

"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, please redirect me to a different, correct forum if it is not the right one. I won't put a very long description so let's just get right in the story. I'm not asking for possible diagnoses I'm just here to search for help and how I can stop thinking this

Ever since I was around 4 or 5 all I could think about was sex. If you asked me what I was daydreaming about the answer would be that - sex. I'm really ashamed to admit it because I've never been one 5o talk about these topics so openly

When I first began daydreaming (around that age) it was about literal animals having relationships like human and having sex. I was 5. It's been more than a decade I'm in my late teenage years and I've not yet to tone it down. I daydream every single hour of the day unless I force myself to stop and even then I still have troubles

I remember asking some of my friends once and all they said was something along the lines of hormones ajnd being a teenager. I don't particularly disagree but I've been doing this since I was 5. Hell I was barely 5

A little bit of TW but it was never just ""casual"" sex. I've always fantasized about getting tortured. Hell I wish I was joking, I was still around the age of 7 or 8 when I thought about these themes. I grew up thinking about hetero relationships but I soon realized I don't have any interest in men and its only been about women for the past half a decade. The thing is though I've never been directly in these fantasies, it's always another ""version"" of me? One that doesn't look like me. And id like to have sexual relationships not, so I dont think this is something that I necessarily control

My grades were never consistent because I just can't focus. This has to be some sort of mental illness or symptoms of one that I haven't seen talked about. One of my theories is OCD because my mom has it but I don't like diagnosing myself and I'll soon go to a therapist to talk about things, however I'm not so sure how much that soon is

 For now I'd like to please ask if any of you have any suggestions or if any of you have experienced this and how to cope properly. I'm tired. Genuinely. Thanks folks",General_disorder

"So about a year ago me and a friend of mine decided to have a fun night hotboxing and doing some magic mushrooms. I had been doing those sorts of nights before and it always ended up being a blast. Not that night though. 
It started off fine, with us having a lot of fun, watching nature documentaries and funny things. At the end of the evening my friend got tired so he decided to go to bed. He went to the toilet, whilst I went on discord to play some games with another friend. The first friend took a while and I didn't hear anything yet, so I went to check up on him. He was about to head upstairs and looked very sleepy, so I laughed at him and directed him to go to bed. He stumbled against me and suddenly fell down. Hard. I thought he just lost his footing which scared me enough, but then he stared having spasms. I was shocked (by now it was like 2-3 at night and I was high af) so I rushed to his side. He started having difficulty to breath and turned purple whilst his eyes turned upwards and went full on white/red. What happened over the past 10 minutes was a blur, but it involved several calls to 112 (the dutch alarm number), cpr (Ive never had any training), him being out of consiousness and not breathing for several minutes, him getting up and falling a couple of times and in the end him thankfully getting up. He went to the hospital, got checked and turned out fine. 
Ive talked to him afterwards and he seems to be doing great. Working out a lot, bought his own house, seems mentally well. But I've been dying inside. Ever since that night I've been suffering from severe PTSD, panic attacks and depression. Almost everyone blames me for what happened. I got threatened by his family members. My brother (who went with the friend to the hospital) has been cussed out, instead of being gifted any sort of thanks. 
It's been killing me. My friend doesnt seem too bothered though. He told me he had another attack like that a couple of weeks ago, but when he was sober. But still he just goes on. How do I do the same? Ive been to therapy, but that didnt help me too much. I keep having the attacks. I cant trust my own body anymore.

"I am 20years old and my entire life I have always thought there was something different about meâ€¦ there are a lot of different reasons I think this. However, Iâ€™ve been Iâ€™ve been specifically hyper focused and curious about what other people think of this:

For as long as I can remember, things about myself have not seemed normal- as in no one else seemed to relate or have any understanding. Starting from where I remember, around pre-K , I remember sleeping with all of the lights on in my room, including lampsâ€¦ this continued on and off for years. 
When I went to into kindergarten, i was introduced to â€œbloody marryâ€-i donâ€™t even know- the girl where u say her name three times and flush the bathroom toilet. Reflecting on this I feel so sad for my younger self. I was so legitimately terrified, that I would not sleep in my own bedroom. I had to be in the presence of someone else for my entire day and night. For around a year, I had to beg my sisters (two of them- a couple of years younger than me) every single night in hopes they would allow me to sleep on their bedroom floor for that night. If they decided they did not want me to sleep on their bedroom floor that night, I would erupt in pure fear and panic and I remember crying so hard begging my sisters to let me sleep on their floor. I would give them my things to repay them for letting me sleep on their floor because I was too scared to sleep in my own bed and room 4 feet down the hall. 

I sleepwalk.  I remember one night, while sleeping on my sisters floor, I sleep walked to my sisters wall,opposite of the actual door. I began banging and hitting the wall begging,crying, and screaming, to let me out and for my mom to come and for help. 

Another time I sleep walked was when I was in middle school and I went out of town for a weekend. I sleep walked out of my hotel room because I was convinced I was left alone in there and I needed to get out!! I remember I became aware of what was going on when I was in the elevator going somewhere by myself. I was so scared because I remember feeling so scared and panicked that I had to get out, but then I also did not have a phone or know where my room was. It was humiliating asking the front desk for help at 2am.

Other sleep incidents Iâ€™ve had, multiple times, I would SLEEP TEXT my mom and call her 1,000 times saying â€˜help meâ€™ in terror. I donâ€™t know what exactly caused me so much panic, but I remember it involves being alone and scared.

When I was a little bit older, my fears formed into being terrified that someone was going to attack me and/or kidnap me. Iâ€™ve never felt safe in my own bedroom. I (still do) check every single (possible and not possible) spot in my bedroom over and over again to make sure that there is not a person hiding somewhere. Despite me checking and proving that no one is there, I can never trust myself. Even though I am aware that there is no one there, I still need to check again.

This extends to how I feel in my own house. I remember trying to fall asleep at night and convincing myself that a noise I heard was a person and i needed to wake up my parents to check.  I was so terrified to stay at my own home alone for even 10 minutes. My younger sisters always made fun of me because I didnâ€™t act my age and they were more mature than me because I was too scared to stay home alone. I did not stay home alone by myself until I was around 16-17 years old. humiliating. 

When I got my own car, I felt safer at my own home. Thus is when I started to stay home alone. However, my fears have been shifted to inside of my car. Before I get in my car I have to check every single spot (possible or not) to make sure there is no one hiding. I take out my flashlight and open every door to make sure I get a good look. However, I am convinced that as I am driving, there is someone back there even tho I checked!! It is a never ending cycle of checking and then needing to check again!! I know there isnâ€™t anyone back there but I have to check!!! If I donâ€™t check I get very scared and paranoid that there actually IS someone there. 

I am literally 20, live with my parents, and still do a lot of this stuff. I want to, but I canâ€™t imagine ever living by myself because I would get too scared.

"So I (17 FTM) am a black trans boy. I havenâ€™t had any gender affirming procedures yet, and recently Iâ€™ve been drowning in dysphoria. I also struggle with intense racial insecurity because of people telling me I â€œact whiteâ€ and things like that.

These are things I deal with constantly. But recently Iâ€™ve also been losing a lot of friends, to the point that I only have two people in my life I know fully support me. I had a breakup about two months ago and Iâ€™m just so miserable. The meds Iâ€™m on donâ€™t help. They just keep me from feeling anything.

In may I tried to end things, and I failed. The subsequent hospitalization and counseling has put my family through so much. Sometimes I wish my attempt had succeeded so I canâ€™t burden them anymore.

I have no social life really outside of my family, so my people-skills may be somewhat lacking, but I do not consider myself a horrible conversationalist. I'm not expecting anything particularly meaningful or life-changing, and would consider this post an amazing success if I could even just have a few pleasant conversations to alleviate my loneliness (and yours, perhaps). I would absolutely love to have a long term friend and penpal but im not counting on that happening from this sorta lame post of mine. I am interested in many things; I love video games, I have a broad taste in music (though I want to mention that I have gained a big appreciation for Bigbang lately, band-wise), I love the horror genre in just about anything (books, movies, games..), I'm an insatiable bookworm, I'm really into anime/manga, and.. what else? I go do karaoke, sometimes, though I don't do it as often as I would like to, because it feels too energy-consuming. Oh, and English is my first language, I would absolutely love to help you learn English if you want!

&amp;#x200B;

I've been struggling with mental health issues all my life which makes it difficult to find friends. Most people only seem to care about you as long as you make them feel good about themselves. I'm looking for genuine people who want to share laughter as well as tears, someone who is honest and doesn't judge. Maybe we could even become friends?

&amp;#x200B;

That might sound depressing but I'm actually pretty optimistic. I try to see the good in everything and everyone. I like getting to know you, details and all, everything you're willing to share. I'm open to pretty much any topic aside from dirty stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I like to think I'm an interesting person and worthy of someone taking the time to get to know, but it always seems as if people lose interest in me and I don't know why. I just want to be good enough for someone. I want friends who care for me as much as I care for them, and I want someone to sincerely appreciate me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot of love for all animals, especially dogs (I have a puppy). I like watching TV series, browsing Reddit, coloring, cosplaying, going for night walks, and drinking tea.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty awkward and insecure and sometimes that shows when talking but as long as you're kind and respectful, I'll do my best to be a good support to you and return the favor. I've been hurt a lot, so please don't talk to me if you're gonna be an jerk. I'm an INFP, for people that are into that.

Some of my favorite anime is Death Note, Totoro, Rising Of The Shield Hero, Fruits Basket, DBZ, Howl's Moving Castle, Elfen Lied, and Seven Seeds.

"So I have a question! For the past year on and off Iâ€™ve been having really strong and vivid hallucinations in my peripheral view. Im a very anxious person and I used to be very paranoid but have grown out of that. So I have a history of seeing things when I was younger but wasnâ€™t diagnosed with anything (I was tested once). Later by fourth grade I developed depression and slight onset of paranoid schizophrenia by middle school but they donâ€™t diagnose it apparently until ppl are 16. Which is cool Bc it totally calmed down after my basically meditating and changing my life everyday. But lately my depression is back as well as this paranoia. As well as these vivid visions of ppl in my peripheral. Iâ€™ve seen ghosts so I know this isnâ€™t like this. This feels more abnormal and reoccurring. Im seeing like full faces in things sometimes as well. When I look back itâ€™s gone.

"Iâ€™m a 25 year old female. 

I struggle with severe mental illness, including depression, borderline personality disorder, PTSD, etc. 

Ideally, I would love to have children - a big family to be exact. But, I just donâ€™t think thatâ€™s realistic when I have severe mental illness. I also think it would be selfish of me to have kids when I know I have severe mental illness. I canâ€™t bring someone else into the world and drag them through the mud with my mental health struggles. 

When I am really sick and have severe episodes, all I do is sleep all day to escape the pain. Just the other day, I felt like I needed to go to the emergency room because I was triggered by a traumatic event from my past. I donâ€™t want to have kids if Iâ€™m in and out of the psychiatric hospital every other month. When I have anxiety attacks, they last a long time and itâ€™s all I can think about. If I didnâ€™t take my medicine, I honestly donâ€™t know how I would be acting. I would probably be worse than a drunk or high person. 

If I had kids, they would be ignored during one of my depressive episodes. I legitimately wouldnâ€™t be able to take care of them. My kids would probably grow to resent me because I would probably be in the psychiatric hospital every other month, or just generally not involved in their life. Thatâ€™s a lot for a kid. Itâ€™s a lot for an adult too, but especially for a child. 

I also would love to get married, and I donâ€™t feel that thatâ€™s the same type of responsibility as having kids. But I also know my husband would probably resent me for bringing so much stress and pain into his life because of my illness. At this point, Iâ€™m seriously considering just staying single and childless my entire life. 

In yâ€™allâ€™s opinions, would you ever have kids despite having a mental illness? And if you do, how do you manage it?",General_disorder

I think everyone is looking and thinking about me, and a part of me sometimes feels better than them. (I donâ€™t really think this but itâ€™s a feeling, I donâ€™t want to feel I promise)

I get overly upset and avoid that person , when I should be happy when others get something Iâ€™ve been wanting.

"Iâ€™m just getting straight into why everything in my life sucks.

I have abandonment issues, Iâ€™m scared of people leaving me for whatever reason. Seriously, itâ€™s my worst fear, my friend secretly hating me/leaving me. Iâ€™ve had multiple anxiety &amp; panic attacks over the thought. This year has been particularly bad for me and my abandonment issues for whatever reason.

It all started in late May. Me and my friends love the show stranger things and the premier was coming out May 25th I think. We were planning to watch is separately then call after and discuss the show. I did that, I watched the first part then texted my friend (Iâ€™ll call them Red, for privacy sakes), they didnâ€™t answer and that was fine I just assumed they forgot to wake up for the premier and Iâ€™d talk about it with them later. Throughout the day I texted and attempted to call Red, and my other friend (Iâ€™ll call him Blue). I got no responses, all my calls were left to ring out and my texts went unanswered. 

Later that week I had found out that Red and Blue hung out without me that day with a whole other group of people. I was invited to their hangout but I was asleep when they sent it since I woke up so early for the premier like we planned I slept in pretty late. It hurt a little that I wasnâ€™t even texted that they were both busy and instead left to my own wonders and anxieties about why neither of them would answer my calls the entire day. 

I then found out from Blue that him and Red had made plans with that other group they hung out with for the upcoming dance for our school. I was again, kinda hurt by this but didnâ€™t say anything because I didnâ€™t wanna be controlling. It wasnâ€™t until the day before the dance when my family found out I didnâ€™t have anyone to go with that I finally called red and blue nearly in tears that I was sorry and didnâ€™t want to be a jealous friend but I was upset that I didnâ€™t have anyone to go with. Plans ended up changing and I went with blue and another person to the dance, red stayed getting red with the other group.

I thought that would be the end of it. No, it was far from the end of it. Throughout June me and Blue talked a lot! I tried to contact Red by calling our GC but they were always busy or just straight up didnâ€™t answer or tell me why they couldnâ€™t join (most of the time I was just left with no answer as to why they couldnâ€™t talk). So once again my anxieties started to get to me, I was worried I was being replaced by the group Red went to the dance with. 

I did end up getting Red on a call once or twice. But all I can remember about these calls is blue and red talking about the hangouts they had with the other group without me. We did talk about other things on those few calls but thatâ€™s all i can really remember.

I ended up confiding in Blue about my worries. And I am so ashamed to say what I did during June. I ended up talking bad about Red to Blue. And before you go off at me in the comments about how Iâ€™m a toxic and jealous person, I know. I know Iâ€™m bad and I shouldâ€™ve handled my emotions better but I canâ€™t take back what happened now. Blue also ended up talking about Red with me.

In late June though I ended up talking with Red on a call about how I felt like they werenâ€™t reaching out and how I wanted to talk more and I didnâ€™t appreciate how they would bring up hang outs theyâ€™d have without me in front of me. They agreed and said we should talk more and they were sorry about bringing up hang outs I wasnâ€™t invited to in front of me.

The next day however I got a long paragraph text message from Red saying I put to much blame on them for not reaching out and that Blue told Red everything I said about them. 

I apologized to Red for everything. For not seeing it from their perspective, for talking bad. And I do truly feel awful and guilty about it you have to believe me. But there wasnâ€™t much more I could do to help fix this but apologize and give Red the time alone they requested to have.

Iâ€™ll be honest, I was angry at Blue. I wasnâ€™t angry at him for snitching on my bad talking, that was fair. I was mad that he snitched on me but not himself. My mindset was if he really cared about Red he wouldâ€™ve told on himself too. 

So I gave Red 2 weeks of alone time, then I called Blue and said he had to tell Red what he said about them too. Blue agreed with me that what he did was shit talking and confirmed he didnâ€™t tell them what he said. He sounded very obviously angry at me that I was even daring to speak with him.

I gave Blue a week to tell Red, then I informed Red myself. Let me make this clear, this was not some motive to try and get Red un mad at me or try and get Red to like me more. This was because I thought it was unfair Red didnâ€™t get the whole story. Red thanked me for telling them and I donâ€™t know what they did with that information.

I texted last Saturday in our GC that I would like to discuss our friendship before school starts and figure everything out. I was fully prepared and ready to accept that they didnâ€™t wanna be friends with me anymore. I just wanted a conclusion to all of this instead of just being left to infer if we are friends are not. I have gotten no response from either of them so far.

During this entire time I have been plagued with suicidal and intrusive thoughts. My mental health has tanked from the isolation Iâ€™ve endured from neither of them speaking to me. I spent the entirety of July having no social contact with anyone and it destroyed me, itâ€™s still destroying me.

And I know this is all my fault because I shouldâ€™ve handled my emotions better and not shit talked. But Iâ€™ve tried my best to repair things, I feel like Iâ€™ve done all I could to repair what Iâ€™ve messed up.

What do I do? This isnâ€™t even me asking how to fix my friendship I just have no clue where to go from here. Iâ€™m so lost, and I know I fucked up and am wrong here but I ask that you donâ€™t just berate me in the replies and give me some advice please.",General_disorder

"Recently Joanna Moncrieff and colleagues published a study in Molecular Psychiatry examining the evidence for and against the idea that depression is the result of, or is associated with, a biochemical imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain - especially serotonin.

Critics have said that this is beside the point, because a) many medications appear to be effective despite their mechanism of action being uncertain (this is very true, and was true for decades in the case of acetylsalicylic acid), and b) no reputable physician has pushed the ""biochemical imbalance"" theory in decades. I find myself wondering if (b) is really the case.

So my question for you is this: If you have been diagnosed as having major depressive disorder (not bipolar disorder), have you been told that your difficulty is the result of a biochemical imbalance? What was the profession of the individual who told you this? Please do not violate your own privacy; if you have an account with your real name, please do not take part. I am interested in people who HAVE and HAVE NOT been told this, so please consider the question either way.",General_disorder
"CW: mention of suicide, self harm, periods

Hello! This is sort of a vent post, but also inviting others who have PMS/hormonal issues + mental illness to share their experiences. I was originally going to post this to a menstruation subreddit, but I feel uncomfortable doing so for reasons I won't get into. I hope it's okay to post this here.

So for some background info, I'm 22, diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and I have pending diagnoses for ADHD and Autism. For a while now, I've been showing signs of PCOS, including pretty severe amenorrhea. I only had one period in 2021, two in 2022 so far (I know, I'm seeing an endocrinologist soon). 

When I got my period last month, the PMS was hell, worse than any PMS I'd ever experienced. My mental health was absolutely awful, to the point where I was seriously contemplating suicide for the first time in a long time. Well, assuming my uterus decides to work this month, I should be getting my period in a few days now, and my mental health is once again in shambles. Every negative emotion feels 100x more intense and I've been crying a lot, which isn't typical for me. I've been on antidepressants for years and did TMS therapy, so usually I'm fairly mentally stable, but it feels like that's all gone out the window. I self harmed for the first time in a long time a couple days ago. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has ever experienced mental health issues this intense specifically before their periods, and how they've been able to deal with it or if they've received any treatments for it (I'm not asking to be prescribed treatments here, just want to know what some of the possibilities are). I will talk to my endo about it and I'm considering therapy again, but I'd like to hear other peoples' experiences. I'm genuinely worried that if I have to deal with this every month, I will end up attempting suicide in the future. I know all of the suicide hotlines and resources, I've been dealing with mental health issues since I was 10. I just can't remember the last time things were this intense and I'm not sure if there's anything I can do about it since I only really feel this bad when I'm PMSing.",General_disorder

"ng story short I have been in a 7 year relationship with my boyfriend. Everything was wonderful in the beginning and nothing seemed out of the ordinary until about 3 years in when my boyfriend confessed to me that he binge drinks. I was shocked but realized all those Sunday nights he â€œleft me alone to studyâ€ (I was in college at the time), he was binge drinking in his apartment. Come Monday morning, he was back to himself doing the best he could do to suppress what happened the day before. 
Ever since then, his episodes of binge drinking have been on and off for these past 4 years. I tried to play the supportive partner role and help him cope with his feelings as best as I could but it seems like thereâ€™s no avail. Weâ€™ve tried everything from therapy, counseling, and medication but what Iâ€™ve noticed is that he hates exploring his childhood past. I learned through bits and pieces that he was sexually assaulted as a child by older kids when he was at his baby sitterâ€™s house. In addition to that trauma, he told me he was also beat by his immediate family (mother, father, and older sister). 
We recently started counseling up again with a close friend of his but the problem is that by him talking about his past, the memories he blocked out are coming back out and so are his binges. Right now he has been on his third day of binge drinking and it seems like nothing can stop him. He still finds ways to buy alcohol and iâ€™m struggling to get him to stop. If someone has been through this personally can you please let me know how to help him overcome this and stop binge drinking.

"I am a fifteen year old female living in England.

My attacks include all the traditional symptoms including a racing heartbeat, nausea/vomiting, trembling, chills, a churning stomach and extreme fatigue.   


I have had all types of therapy over the past four years but so far nothing has worked - I've been through the CAMHS system (up to stage 2, I was recently discharged), I've had CBT, called helplines in times of crisis and tried every breathing/grounding technique in existence but nothing ever works. I'm getting pretty fucking tired of waking up, feeling so terrified for absolutely no reason that I uncontrollably throw up, and going days without eating as a result. The only hope for me now is medication. However, as mentioned before I only made it to stage 2 of CAMHS as my attacks aren't regular (only a couple of times a month) and you need to be in stage 3 to be prescribed medication.  


I'm lucky enough to have been blessed with very supportive and patient parents and for that I am eternally grateful. They too are trying so hard to get help for me but we just don't know what to do. I'm losing so much weight and I don't feel like my normal self anymore, the panic just keeps getting worse and worse so I was just wanting to ask if anyone has any advice on how to get CAMHS to work with us in the way that I need?

- doesnâ€™t ask me deep questions or anything about my childhood 
- doesnâ€™t always have a plan - every session is random

Whenever I text her, that stupid word â€œcheeseâ€ gets in my head and triggers an anxiety attack when I communicate. It sometimes makes it hard to take a person seriously or truly listen to them because itâ€™s intrusive to my brain. Another example is, I associate smelly vagina with the phrase â€œthe mapleâ€ Why I do this is beyond me. But I had this crush that I associated with a smelly vagina for some reason. God only knows why. I sure as heck wish I knew. So it was extremely difficult to talk to her because whenever I would communicate with her, â€œthe mapleâ€ would get in my head. There is 0 evidence to suggest that she has a smelly vagina so why I do this is unknown. But it was intrusive to my ability to communicate with her. And for some reason, I associate moms of teenagers with the phrase â€œweâ€™ve got the bananasâ€ and whenever I talk to my friends moms, that gets stuck in my head and triggers anxiety. Usually, Iâ€™m able to fake it not being a problem but being in college, the assigning words thing became so overwhelming, I had to isolate in my dorm and looking at people was hard. I donâ€™t understand the science behind it. What I do know is that it is very silly and irrational. Itâ€™s ridiculous to think assigning â€œthe mapleâ€ to someone can trigger loads of anxiety when attempting to talk to them. I saw a psychiatrist and took Zoloft for a bit. She said I had OCD and generalized anxiety. The Zoloft did nothing. She told me sheâ€™s never heard of this case before. Itâ€™s very hard to talk about. I come on here because I would like to hear if anyone else has experienced this because I feel alone. And if so, whatâ€™s the solution? The thoughts just keep ruminating and it affects my ability to socialize. What the hell is wrong with me?",General_disorder
"about a few months ago i was diagnosed with depression. i have antidepressants now, but my mom hasnâ€™t been giving them to me recently so i havenâ€™t been feeling well lately. but this feeling is different from depression. whenever iâ€™m home alone or i havenâ€™t talked to someone in a while, i get this weird feeling in my stomach and i just feel sick. my throat tightens and i start to cry. i get bad thoughts. thoughts mainly about separation from my family or my boyfriend. i get scared since theyâ€™re really the only people i have. i figured i developed some kind of separation anxiety, but the symptoms for that seem much more extreme. people with separation anxiety seem to not be able to handle being physically alone at all, but iâ€™m able to be alone for a while until i start to breakdown and have those thoughts. iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s wrong with me, please help.",General_disorder

"Hey, I hope everyone is having a great day. Well, first of all, I apologize for my bad grammar, English is not my first language. So, for as long as I remember, I've suffered from depression. I experience relapses and sad feelings since I was a kid. Later on, I started to isolate myself. I was afraid of social interactions. The fear of being judged always holds me back. Earlier this year, I met a girl. She was the only person that made me feel free to talk about everything and do things without fear of judgment. She became my girlfriend and I was comfortable with her. But we decided to take a break for some time and we both accepted it well and agreed to be friends, but she barely talks to me anymore. I've lost the only person I was able to start a conversation and now I feel so lonely. We study together, so these social interactions got even worse, cause we are in the same friend group and she avoids me and I do not want to make her uncomfortable, so I just keep overthinking all the time I'm at school, more than I used to overthink before, and I just can't handle 6 hours every day of anxiety feelings that even makes my breathing hard at times and when this period ends, I only fear the next day and can't stop to overthink about all the little things that happened. I keep thinking that I don't wanna be me anymore and don't want to wake up the next day. All I want is some sessions of psychotherapy, but I'm a minor and my parents don't support this. They are Christians and say that I need a good relationship with god and everything is going to be okay. I don't know what to do, my social anxiety just doesn't let me live my life.

"tldr at the end
before i started therapy and medication, i had depression symptoms, and when i started to have panic attacks for no reason, i started therapy. got prescribed with some pills and it was going alright, but the more time i was taking pills, the more i wanted to hurt my self and commit suicide. now i had these thoughts before taking pills but it wasn't as intense as it was while i was on meds. i even attempted it, i think i would've never done that off meds. turns out i started having bpd symptoms, i neevr had any of its symptoms before medication, so i stopped. completely. i stopped taking all my pills without telling my therapist. i know its wrong and it might get worse but it just went back to me having depression not even an intense depression which has me surprised but it's my experience. but the thing is, i no longer had bpd symptoms. idk how to end this but i can't put my thoughts into words rlly but i tried my best.

Hi there. My partner just communicated to me that he is scared that I will become suicidal again and scared of the repercussions for our future together. Unfortunately I know I have a depressive personality. I cannot promise that it won't happen again because I do not know what the future holds. I told him to think about it and decide if he wants to have a partner where this potential exists. I'm not suicidal at all right now but it makes me feel really insecure that he feels like this. I gave him the honest answer: I don't know. I know mental illnesses don't just go away. I've always had a very pessimistic view on life and really believe everything is messed up in society as a whole. Was I right in telling him that I do not know and that he should make the decision for himself? Can we make it if he can't relate to me on this level? He's never been in my sort of situation. I'm thinking it's just best if we call it quits. I don't necessarily want to be with someone who can't deal with my rough patches and I don't want him to feel obligated to stay with me. I want him to make the best decision for himself but I feel bad that I couldn't comfort him at all with my answer,General_disorder
Questions in title. Thank you in advance!,General_disorder
"The nature of my condition is this:
 
The ""seizure"" acts as a memory suppressor. If my brain brings up an unpleasant memory (""cringe worthy"" memories, mostly of me doing/saying things strangely/oddly/abnormally and wishing I had done/said things better or more normally, of which countless of them I have cos I'm unfortunately socially inept) I will then have a ""seizure"" that manifests in the form of loud short-lived shrill shrieks and/or rapid stiff shaking and jerking of the body. They usually last 1-3 seconds, but I can experience it multiple times and all in all could add up to maybe 7 seconds, or there could be quite a few seconds of time in between each one so it's not really measurable. After the seizure, the memory usually finds it hard to resurface, and it becomes very murky/vague when somehow recalled at a later time. I can physically feel the memory being pushed back into the depths of my brain too, and if I'm lucky I never remember it again out of the blue. Sometimes I don't forget it even after the ""seizure"", and it's quite uncomfortable just sitting with the memory until it goes away, but that's very seldom. They happen very frequently, daily or almost daily, and grow stronger when I've done something ""cringe"" recently or if something triggers me or reminds me of it (meaning I want to really suppress memories of those occurrences).

I've had this for years now, but none of the doctors that have seen me know wtf I have. (Or they mostly dismiss it and just treat me w/medication for BPD lol. To be fair I go to in a public hospital in a 3rd world country, so.) 

It's bad because the people around me especially family have been very startled (quite literally jumpscared) when it happens and yet I can't even explain why in like a simple word cos there doesn't seem to be a name for it. 

All I can think of is that it relates to trauma. I've seen how DID fragments the identity to protect the self from traumatic memories. My memories really should not be classified as traumatic cos they seem trivial but I think I do have trauma and that it relates to loss and ostracization/isolation, acting ""normally"" and socially acceptably seems to be important to my subconscious to the point where I have to develop this weird ass condition to express disdain for those memories.

So the question as it stands is thisâ€”what even is my condition? Does it have a name? Has anyone experienced it? Am I just making things up to gain sympathy points or to have something to post on reddit to farm karma? Or is it something that has actually already been identified in other people?

If anyone could tell me or redirect me to someone who could know, I would be very grateful. Sorry for the trouble.",General_disorder

"As a child, I purposely held on to these memories and iâ€™m not sure why. iâ€™ve never told anyone about them except my sisters and maybe a friend. 
My mom is a full blown schizophrenic. The last time I can remember her without hallucinations or delusions was when i was around 3 or 4 but I was too young to tell. When I was 4 I started living with my paternal grandparents because my parents basically chose drugs over us, but when kindergarten ended my mom took us to a far away state for a whole year. In that year she was rapidly changing. She would say things like â€œremind me Iâ€™m your momâ€ in the daytime and things like â€œYou arenâ€™t my kid who are you iâ€™m going to k*ll youâ€ by the night time. 
Thereâ€™s a few times that really stand out to me. 
This one night, that year, she had woken me up in the middle of the night, (me out of my two sisters, i felt i got picked on more and sometimes i cant help but wonder why), arguing with her mom, being delusional and paranoid as ever. She repeatedly told me â€œYouâ€™re not my daughter, sit your ass on the chair and dont moveâ€ 
My grandma (her mom) told me to go back to bed but I was too scared to move. My mom then took a 5 gallon water bin and dumped it all over me, and sent me back to bed. I just crawled into bed soaking wet. I didnâ€™t even cry. Somehow that moment hit me worse than all the abuse she put me through. Especially now in my 20s
By the end of first grade my paternal grandparents went and took us back from our mom and had custody of us ever since. I never told them about all the abuse I faced because I was only 6, and I didnâ€™t understand what abuse was until my friend got taken by CPS for it in 7th grade. 
My mom is still schizophrenic to this day but she always apologized over the years for the way she treated us. She was somehow a bit more present in my life than my dad has ever been but I pushed her away for years until recently. I could never open up in therapy as a teen perhaps it was too late.
I am 22 now, and very very sensitive. I mean I have always had painful teary outbursts, along with negative angry ones but now i am pretty much super sentimental. Im vegetarian i canâ€™t even eat animals thinking about what they go through. Just thinking about the wrong thing makes me cry. My inner child is never satisfied because no one knew her pain and now I donâ€™t know what to do with this pain. 
Itâ€™s finally surfaced, all those bad memories and I donâ€™t know what to do with them. It hurts so bad. I donâ€™t hate my mom, i love her with all my heart, she has an illness and I understand that. But its hard to live with so much painful childhood memories. I used to see red in her eyes as a child, I still remember the demon I saw in her. What do i do? How do I move forward? 
I feel so disembodied from who I was, and I struggle with knowing who i am, because of her iâ€™ve never known. i cant stand this feeling and i just wish i could hug my inner child who was repeatedly let down. Who wanted her parents to choose her though they never did.
I under all this is in the past, but itâ€™s hard to let go. I feel like im abandoning apart of myself that never was seen, by forgiving and forgetting and my inner child refuses to let those moments &amp; memories go. I was just a kid and now that kid is crying again and again and cant be consoled as tears fall down my face at night.",General_disorder
"
So Iâ€™m on holiday in Greece and I have a swimming pool there and it started off with me worrying about going underwater too long and I actually stayed in longer that I should of to test myself. ThenI started researching and what came up was far from reassuring, I searched up â€˜Is it hard to drown yourselfâ€™ and there was a question on quora so I clicked on it and looked if there was answers and this one guy gave a step to step on how to drown yourself. It didnâ€™t get better bc there was another guy on here trying to get vulnerable people and give them a way they could drown which scared the hell out of me. Anyway obviously this triggered my OCD and when I got back in the pool with my family I did some unnecessary testing.
I would put my head underwater and when I was running out of breath I would see if I felt anxious or I wanted to drown and I felt nothing and this scared me so I did this multiple times. Once I was thinking for so long if I felt anxious or not that i was underwater for a long time and my family had to make me realise I was under there. Iâ€™m scared that I will get determined to drown myself and Iâ€™m scared I will do it (Iâ€™m not depressed)",General_disorder

"Okay, yes this is weird as hell but I canâ€™t help but see a correlation between him being hyper sexual and his inability to jerk off and have an ejaculation. The guy apparently has wet dreams very often and thatâ€™s likely because there is a sperm overload caused by his lack of ejaculation. That would explain why heâ€™s extremely horny and super desperate to find a girl to have sex with. Heâ€™s a virgin and has literally no concept of how to talk to girls but I digress. The point is, heâ€™s unfortunately bipolar, has ADHD, probably OCD but heâ€™s also not very smart to begin with. And with that being the case, the guy doesnâ€™t know how to jerk off. It would be gay as hell for me to teach him but I honestly think that would help with his hyper sexual tendencies. After all, heâ€™s never witnessed post nut clarity or the refractory period so Iâ€™m sure that would change his perspective on being desperate for sex. If he had the ability to relieve himself, he wouldnâ€™t be so damn horny and desperate to get sex and fail. It may not eliminate the problem altogether but it may improve it by a landslide. It would be weird as hell to teach the guy to jerk off. How can he learn to jerk off.

"he told me that he thinks I'm just tired and my brain is playing tricks on me and it's the biggest amount of bullshit I've ever heard. he was so quick to dismiss me that I didn't even try to talk to him. I had spot on to him for around an hour, I don't even remember him asking about what I was experiencing (I think he got notes from what I've said to other people) he asked alot about my sleep and how I felt throughout to day, I told him I always felt exhausted and like I wasn't even in my own body and he interpreted that as me not having enough sleep (i sleep 7-18 hours a day)- completely ignoring the fact that MULTIPLE professionals thought I had severe depression and that I'm heavily medicated for it but. I hate him. so I'm hearing babies crying and little girls under my bed telling me that no one will believe me and whispering and laughing. rhythmic knocking and door handles jiggling like someone is trying to get in. men following me around and walking through doors and out the next closest one without any faces just a smooth surface where it should be. black cat like creatures running past me and standing in door ways staring at me with red eyes and scampering off. footsteps and whispering. women laughing and men yelling my name... becasue I'm tired??? I sat in a corner of a room with a butcher's knife shaking on the floor becasue I thought a man was following me home and was trying to get in the house, I woke up the next morning with blood on my hand becasue I had cut myself. he said ""oh I see shadows and thing too when I just wake up!"". he also thought my antipsychotics were making me groggy so I was seeing and hearing things and made me start taking a lower dose. completely ignoring the fact that it was happening any where at different times of the day even if I was wide awake and in any mood. I'm second guessing myself, he said that if I really DID have psychosis I have to be on way more of my medication to make it stop, even though I have asked to be on more of it because it wasn't stopping and was denied. and besides, I had already seen a psychosis specialist from the same fucking place and she said she believes that I was experiencing these things as a symptom of a different mental illness and not something like psychosis or schizophrenia. he said that he probably won't see me again and ended the call, the first time I saw him I spoke to him for 40 minutes and this time for around 10.

Pretty much as soon as I left for college and had space to heal myself I pulled a 180. I now have so many friends who I love so much and I know they love me a lot too. Iâ€™d never want to hurt any of them. Iâ€™ve even reconnected from some people from high school who are so impressed with how much Iâ€™ve changed.

Its been a couple months since that point and my writing ability has yet to return, the blocks still there and I cant get it out.

I absolutely adore music and I listen to it for like 8 to 10 hours a day, yesterday my brain basically told me I dont enjoy music anymore and now I cant find enjoyment in the music I loved anymore and its driving me absolutely nuts. For one last example my brain started telling me my hearing was getting worse and it ruined so many of my social interactions, I went to the ear doctor and my hearing was apparently perfect, but I still cant get it out of my mind that my hearings bad. Also this isnt like a puberty related thing, ive had this same problem since I was about 6 or 7, when I cried all day long cause I was unable to turn off manually swallowing my spit or breathing, just to add it in cause i dont know if its related or not  ive always been incredibly incompetent in every day tasks to the point you would think im 4 years old and from the ages of like 8 to 13 I was insanely terrified of the dark and when I tried going to sleep I always thought robbers were downstairs and were gonna kill me and things like that, although that went away as I grew up, I also used to be incredibly confident, but now have severe social anxiety.

Iâ€™m diagnosed bipolar, n think iâ€™m rapid cycling but I honestly donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening with me. all i know is that i keep having visions of dying, have full blown conversations with myself, go from sobbing/feeling everything to emotionless/apathetic/careless and I see black figures that i stare at (or avoid) until iâ€™m viscerally scared of it. earlier today I nearly convinced myself the CDC, CIA &amp; FBI were trying to cause mass hysteria through articles to control ppl/make us lose our minds for observation and im still kind of believing it. I also take song lyrics as inspiration for change in my life and think my friends and family absolutely hate me.

iâ€™m not taking meds rn (i feel like thatâ€™s obvious), abuse drugs on weeks to month binges (liquor, coke, weed, E, molly, percocets, etc) &amp; have very risky, scary sexual encounters/get off to the most violent, immoral porn.

whenever iâ€™m triggered by something, i think i go into psychosis(possibly?) but i never even know iâ€™m in psychosis until after when I feel super confused, shameful, severely depressed or manic and am dealing with the severe consequences of my own actions (actions that feel like dreams) ie: recently unfriended all my childhood friends n burned bridges, skipping weeks of work, not talking to family, not eating or leaving the house. I will also be talking then all of sudden itâ€™s like I canâ€™t see or hear and I just come to seconds later and donâ€™t know what I said to the person standing in front of me. It happened yesterday and has 2 or 3 times now.

I get into these episodes where I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s real n what isnâ€™t. if iâ€™m real, if my surroundings are or what iâ€™m even doing with my existence. I also go through periods of not wanting to speak or move, along with being extremely anxious in/about my body to the point where I donâ€™t know how to position myself normally n feel like an uncomfortable, stiff blob.

but yeah, now iâ€™m scared to go again bc I donâ€™t want to disappoint my family, iâ€™m gonna miss my cats n I feel so embarrassed for being this way. I also want to go for a short amount of time but iâ€™m scared that if i tell the whole truth, iâ€™m gonna be held there longer than anticipated.. i donâ€™t even know if iâ€™ll remember what it is thatâ€™s important to mention.

the worst is that i feel I have no control over it. im just watching myself do these things to myself while these voices are screaming at me to stop (or sometimes encouraging bc i will be feeling so important or as if im doing nothing wrong) but I never stop. it doesnâ€™t even feel like me half the time.",General_disorder
"people MY age or younger , struggling just as much, less, or more, graduating early or something in my school I think proves that I'm not good enough? people say not to base your worth on grades or on other people but since school is all I have it's like I should just not exist.
the world doesn't revolve around me, obviously. but when i sit here and people , MY FRIENDS, are just graduating and shit and i'm barely being taken seriously with my mental health and i'm anxious or making a fuss about something that isn't a big deal to anyone else, it makes me feel like shit. holy shit man im not graduating and my friends are just going above and beyond.. my family is telling me everythings going to be fine (but its not and they just don't give af to say anything else) and everything js just going on rn???  i don't feel accomplished or like i have purpose anymore and i dont have self esteem or confidence

"Needing to self-reflect.


In my childhood, my mom was very strict ultra conservative Christian that â€œhomeschooledâ€ my siblings and I, and my father was physically and emotional negligent he didnâ€™t participate very much; My life was that way up to the age of 12.

At the age of 12 my mom divorced my dad because he was emotional unavailable which in turn caused a lot of drama. My father then picked up and alcohol habit and my mom became almost hysterical she stopped believing in Christianity as much and completely changed (looking back now it was likely a midlife crisis). 

She became a partier and started to drink all the time blasting loud music at all times of the day and night being very drunk, somehow she held down a jobâ€¦ this made her almost completely absent emotionally and often times physically. 

All of these things happening while my siblings and I were being â€œhomeschooledâ€ hardly anything schooling was going on at all. I tried using the resources I had at the time to teach myself things because it was increasingly hard because of the emotional distress because of my environment. And this lasted for the rest of my childhood.  Whether she was drinking or not she was hysterical. She would scream and cry at all times of the day. 

Before the age of 12 she didnâ€™t teach us many things either she called the â€œunteaching methodâ€. My sister didnâ€™t learn to read until she was about 13, and I still donâ€™t know my times tables it was things like that that fell through the cracksâ€¦. Including social isolation.

She started giving me alcohol at around age 14. She would also give me alcohol when I was feeling down to â€œmake me feel betterâ€.
The older I got the more I drank and I did so to avoid my feelings. At the time she wanted to â€œpartyâ€ together and would often tell my very crude things about her personal life discussing things about her boyfriend. They could often be overheard loudly engaging in â€œactivitiesâ€ sometimes in the same room as me when I had no where else to go.

All of this happened for years.

My father then became completely absent from my life and I never talk to him now. He became very violent at one point abusing our animals and pulling guns on my mom and things like that.

She has calmed down a lot now but has a good job but continues to struggle with her addiction and mental health. Having many mood swings. She is either very happy or very sad, very extreme.

I am an adult now I am just using this platform to vent because I donâ€™t know who to talk to about it.

I now struggle with alcohol, social anxiety, anxiety in general, depression, and I tend to avoid many of the things in my life including emotions which is why Iâ€™m writing this out to self-reflect.

I am consistently taking steps to improve myself and grow and I take responsibility for my life and my actions just wanted to vent my thoughtsâ€¦ Because the fear to do simple things can sometimes be crippling.

"I am diagnosed with emetophobia, OCD, BPD, and depression. Last winter, I began to experience these symptoms:

1. False memories of me vomiting in places/situations I never did or donâ€˜t even know.

2. Jamais-vus: The opposite of deja-vus. I feel like Iâ€™ve never seen or experienced certain places/situations Iâ€™m actually familiar with. Everything around me turns into uncanny valley. 

3. Derealisation. Life isnâ€˜t real.

4. Depersonalisation. I am not real.

5. ""Visions"" of me vomiting in ""the future"".

6. Paranoia. The world seems dangerous, threatening and unsafe. At night, I always feel like someone or something is watching me. Iâ€˜m particularly afraid to look down the hallway or out the window. At daytime, EVERYONE and EVERYTHING is a possible trigger for all of the symptoms above.

7. My thoughts change depending on the weather. If itâ€˜s grey and gloomy outside, itâ€˜s grey and gloomy in all of my fake memories/visions as well. Winter always used to be the most difficult time of the year for me. Now itâ€˜s summer. The sun is so triggering. My brain associates all things summer with â€¦ vomiting??? The sea, blue skies, holidays, temperature, atmosphere, mood, everything is connected to nausea and vomiting. And I feel the worst between 1 and 7 PM. The only weather that can actually calm me down is rain.

I have never in my life taken any illegal drugs, but I heavily drank alcohol for three years (2018-2021).

Does anyone know what I am experiencing?",General_disorder
" Hello everyone. I (22, F) need your help.

I started going to therapy this year and then I realized there was actually nothing so very wrong about my life and environment that could explain why am I like this. I always just assumed I am a bit different than others and stressed because I'm gay in a semihomophobic country, poor, or surrounded by assholes. But after being halfway honest for the first time in my life with another person (my therapist) I realized I could maybe be the problem. The issue is that I can't tell my therapist everything because I don't want to get locked up or worse. I will try to summarize a list of my ""problems"" and I hope someone can relate and point me in the right direction. I am looking for some ideas about healthier coping mechanisms or solutions.

1. I'm suicidal since I was 13. Mostly passively but with dangerous short periods where I actually make a plan or stop myself at the last moment. Recently these periods started to happen more frequently hence I'm writing this post because I am getting VERY TIRED of having to save myself all the time, it's EXHAUSTING. I also started to self-harm at the same age and continue to do it .
2. I am an addict. I get addicted to basically anything. I first got addicted (pills) at 15, then came alcohol (I hate it now, it lost its magic). Brief experimenting with other drugs, luckily I'm too broke to continue any of them. I am currently addicted to weed (I'm high all day for 2 years basically). I don't mind the addiction personally but it is expensive and illegal where I live which makes it very unpractical so I wish I could just function without it.
3. I feel empty and bored out of my mind ALL THE FUCKING TIME. So I do shit. I fight with people. I steal at work. Imagine problems to occupy me ( I realize they are imaginary only after I solve them and it doesn't change a thing). Sabotage myself and others (ex. broke my roommate's laptop just before an exam so she couldn't study and I could watch her panic and help her find a solution and be a hero :)) I am actually a very busy person because I work and study and have a very active social life yet I am still boreeeed.
4. Related to 3. I love to steal, it makes me feel alive. I steal from shops. From my parents when I visit. I actually stole from every single friend I have. I also have zero respect for boundaries I guess. I go through their journals and internet history and their wallets. Keep evidence and info just in case they try to blackmail me or so I could win a fight easier or keep them from leaving me. I thought everyone is like this, but people are usually shocked when I just joke about it.
5. I don't have a single person in my life that I am honest with. All my friends know different versions of my past, opinions and dreams (some more true than others but mostly lies lol) depending on who they are and what I need from them at the moment. But also I don't really feel like I have a real me it changes constantly so maybe I am not lying after all. I have to admit I find it fun to lie sometimes. It just fills me with some type of joy I guess? Sometimes I lie for no reason at all, it is just more natural than telling the truth. I also did some fucked up things to them behind their back (spilled secrets, manipulated friends to fight each other, almost broke up a couple) which they haven't found out. I am not very aware while I am doing it (most of the time, sometimes I plan). They all describe me as very caring and compassionate, which I am most of the time. I am that type of a friend people tell to stop being such a doormat lol. I like making people feel special and loved. But I also love lying to them and secretly having all the control.
6. When I don't feel empty I feel angry or desperate or feel every emotion I get frustrated very easily. And cry when frustrated. I have angry outbursts where I break things and hit myself. Sometimes anger is so intense I do it in public because I can't just keep it in anymore. I have these random episodes of intense loneliness and isolation and jealousy of everyone who has a romantic relationship (I never had one, it's hard as a lesbian to find someone.) Anger brings me most problems since student jobs usually include customers which I HATE WITH ALL MY PASSION and I often have angry episodes which get me fired. Or people think I am crazy or overly sensitive which I HATE.
7. CONSTANT MOOD SWINGS. I hate this the most, its energy consuming and I can't get half the shit done. (ex I wake up suicidal, feel inspired to change my life 2 hours later then angry at the world in the afternoon and like a black empty hole by evening.)
8. I get bored of/ start to hate everything. No job is interesting for longer than 2 months. I love meeting new people, it's one of the rare things that make me feel alive. New friendships are so much fun. But after a while people get so boring I just want them to leave me alone. So I start fights or ditch them if they are not useful anymore. I am also very indecisive so I change my mind constantly about everything in my life. The only thing that keeps my interest long-term is my career choice, I fucking love what I study and that's the reason I am still alive.
9. I feel trapped in life and have a strong urge to just run away where no one knows me and start over. My family expects me to work and help and study. Friends want me to be stable and not do impulsive stuff. They all take, take and take. I just want freedom.

Life is just getting too hard for me. All I wanted in the past is to go out and have fun and adventures. But now I feel too limited by money, obligations, people, and location. All I want to do is sleep all day, or get high and listen to music.

"32F, Bear with me, this is long but I just needed to confess this all since I havenâ€™t talked to anyone else in my life about this.  I am really struggling right now and not sure where else to post this. I just recently hit 10 months sober but I feel like Iâ€™m doing everything Iâ€™d do in a relapse except Iâ€™m not drinking. I have been MIA from my job for the last week. Iâ€™ve stopped paying on my credit card bills and let my car insurance lapse almost 4 months ago. In general, Iâ€™ve been pretty much ignoring any and all responsibilities I can get away with. I have pretty much cut off all communication with my sober support networks and others that keep an eye on me and like to check in. Iâ€™ve stopped communicating with my sponsor. I stopped going to my regular meetings and home groups. 
Currently, I live with my Aunt and do not have to pay rent so as of now thankfully, I still have a roof over my head and am living relatively comfortably. 
Honestly, Iâ€™m not sure why I started acting this way. I went through this cycle of feeling really impulsive in late April/early May. I started over spending by a lot on beauty and skincare products and some clothes and shoes.  my aunt decided to buy a house suddenly and move out of the condo she had been living in for a couple of years. Because, I had been terrible with my money, I really had no choice but to pack up and move with her to this new house....On top of that, a few weeks before the move was suppose to take place, my aunt fell and majorly fractured her hip. She had to get surgery and could not put any weight on her right side which pretty much rendered her bed ridden. My aunt and I donâ€™t have any family living in the same state as us and we are both pretty much estranged from most immediate and extended family. I felt like I suddenly had the full burden or facilitating the move into the house for my aunt and helping her as she healed from her hip fracture. I was able to start working from home after my auntâ€™s injury. Realistically, she probably shouldâ€™ve been in a rehab facility for the first month of her recovery but she insisted on being in her home  so I thought I could make it work. She needed a lot of help and assistance right off the bat, as soon as she got home. She had a lot of issues with sleeping and pain management and so I didnâ€™t get much sleep being the only one at home to help her. Even though I was suppose to be working from home, I quickly fell off. Iâ€™d be so tired during the day after staying up all night with my aunt that, Iâ€™d end up spending a good chunk of my work day napping in between trying to continue assisting my aunt. At this time, I started getting really bad fatigue, like no matter how much I slept or tried to catch up on sleep, I still felt exhausted  all the time. The fatigue came with a mix of generally feeling depressed and a little hopeless about my life. Despite all of this, I pushed on with the move and got my aunt moved into her new house. She hired movers that took out the larger furniture items, I just had to make sure everything was ready and out of the way for them to take it. Her lease on the condo doesnâ€™t end until the end of September so I figured I could slowly pack up and move the small things and Knick knacks and bring them over little by little. 
By the time I got my aunt settled into the new house, I went from feeling progressively more mentally  unhinged to progressively more out of control. I pretty much abandoned work. I was still clocking in every morning but I was doing the bare minimum to just make it appear that I was present. Then I stopped answering my phone. My co-workers and supervisor contacted me and I just didnâ€™t take the calls. I couldnt explain why. I just felt shut down. I still was mot sleeping through the night and my aunt seemed to need something every 20 minutes. I was doing all the cooking, cleaning, meal prep, helping her get dressed and cleaned up daily. I just felt overwhelmed and constantly exhausted. I slept whenever I could, including any time during the day I could get a break from my aunt. 
I have struggled with mental  health issues since my teenage years. Iâ€™ve been on and off different mental health meds since I was 13. Thankfully, My sponsor was a big proponent of me getting outside help with therapy and meds so that became a part of my recovery journey as well. I started on Wellbutrin 3 months into my sobriety and that helped tremendously with a lot of my depressive symptoms. I felt motivated to start bathing, brushing my teeth, and start med taking care of myself but I still struggled a lot with procrastination at work, putting stuff off for too long and not being organized, not feeling motivated to return emails and calls or taking forever to respond. These things had been issues I had with my job since I started almost three years ago. I did end up getting testing for ADHD that ended up being frustratingly inconclusive.
I just donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I have been given so many wonderful opportunities and advantages in life that others didnâ€™t have and I should be doing so much more with it. I went to good schools. I grew up in good neighborhoods. I have a masterâ€™s degree but I feel like I barely function as an independent human.
I was working a 12 step program with my sponsor as well as attending meetings once to twice a week.  All that has slowed down tremendously. My sponsor has over 24 years of sobriety but  has been struggling to deal with a really horrible tragedy that happened in her family about 6 months ago. I completed my step 4 but weâ€™ve yet to do step 5 and this has been dragging out for months. 
I feel so uncomfortable talking to anyone else about my struggles because it feels inexplicable. All of my problems I have 100% caused for myself and I canâ€™t explain how I let myself get here other than being a lazy, cowardly, spoiled, entitled, unable to communicate failure of a human. I donâ€™t even know how to begin working on things. Iâ€™m stuck in this house with my aunt who has a broken hip, who is driving me crazy with absolute loss of control over everything else in my life right now. I just needed to confess this all because I havenâ€™t expressed everything that had been going on with me to a single some yet. 
I have all of these AA adages stuck in my head like donâ€™t get stuck in a pity party, have gratitude, pray, surrender and hand your will over, do the next right thing, self-centeredness is the root of all our problems. Acceptance is the answer. I canâ€™t bring myself to go to a meeting because I almost feel like I know what I will hear. I just need to get unstuck. Iâ€™m sober but my life is still very much out of control and Iâ€™m baffled.",General_disorder

"Does anybody feel the same as me?

I am a maladaptive daydreamer, I figured that I am ever since I read an article of what it was about. Whenever I watch new anime or read manga that I find interesting I always fantasize about the main characters together. After that, since I admire the characters, I start fantasizing about how I have the looks, attitude and personality of one of them. Like I'm creating a fictional me in my head. Even If I finished watching it, it's still fresh in my mind for how many months. This doesn't happen when watching real people movies.  I don't desire the lives of real peole no matter how successful or happy they are. I only desire these fictional characters. I get so into it and can vividly imagine the scenario. I also feel the emotions depending on the daydream. I become happy and act like it's real in my mind. I smile, laugh or cry depending on the situation in my mind, if someone was watching I would look like a fool. I don't think I have a problem in my real life, I don't hate everything except my job. I hate my job, but even though I hate it I don't think I'll ever change if I quit my job. I have a lover, a wonderful and supportive lover. We've been together for four years but I don't feel the same as when we first met or when we were on our first 2 years. When we started going out I only daydream sometimes since my attention is focused. Even with my ex, I once again started daydreaming after the first 2 years.. We broke up, in our 3rd year together since she found someone new. At that time, I have thoughts of killing myself. I feel useless. I don't think I'll have suicidal thoughts ever again, I am a lot stronger now. I will never have suicidal thoughts again but I think the afterlife without pain must be wonderful, that's why I keep enduring and living. I have anger issues, when I'm angry I tend to say horrible words and forgot everything else no matter who that person is, I verbally abuse my lover, but only when I'm angry. I think I am financially stable, I graduated college and passed a board exam. I have a well paying job but I hate it, it's corrupt. I have 4 wonderful cats but I rarely spend time with them, I feel guilty but I'm not doing anything. I keep daydreaming because it makes me happy. I feel empty if I'm not. I feel that I won't be happy if I'm not like the character in my head. Whenever I'm not doing anything I start to daydream like crazy, like a lot of hours, like 5 hours straight. So, am I depressed? Do I have a mental illness? By the way, when my mother was around 45-50s she started hearing voices of our neighbors or relatives, but she's sane. She knows what she's doing, but she's verbally responding to what she hears. Does mental illness run in our blood? I got INTP-A in a personality test, does it have anything to do with it? How can I be happy? I don't want to keep living feeling empty.",General_disorder

"Hello Everyone! I hope everyone is feeling well. 

I'm going to start with my educational background. I received my bachelors in Psychology and Economics in 2017 from Elizabeth City State University, Go Vikings!   I always knew I wanted to become a therapist so going on to gain my master in psychology was a no brainier. I graduated with my masters of clinical mental health counseling in 2019 from the University of North Carolina Pembroke. During this time I also started my first paid Internship and I have to be honest with you this was the most rewarding and regretful  time of my life. This internship taught the true importance of proper mental health recourses within the community. It allowed me to develop relationships both professional and personal that will truly last a lifetime. This time became regretful, by seeing the sheer amount of people that struggled with mental health that weren't able to get help because they couldn't afford it or didn't have insurance. At the time I knew you couldn't help everyone, but your opinion changes when there are more people going out the door than coming in. I knew I had ideas about trying to help under served communities. 

During my internship there were several things I found not to be desirable about how the conventual therapeutic practice is ran. I decided after my internship was completed I would open a practice that broke conventual norms and allowed people of all backgrounds to access to affordable mental health consulting.

 Fast forward to 2021 I completed my internship and started my own mental health consulting practice, that places an emphasis on providing mental health consulting for underserved communities, for an affordable price. My main goal is provide help for people who need it and not just people who can afford it!

My mind is so screwed up, I ruin everything. Even the best thing to ever happen to me, and it only just started.

Is this a normal thing and everyone is like this? based on other people and how they act it seems some people actually must feel what they do since they react more impulse like if you burn your hand you automatically move it out of the way

"Iâ€™ve had a pretty rough mental health day today. I figured it was because of the weekly Sunday scaries. Within the past few months, I started taking medication to help me with my anxiety/depression. Long story short, after trying out two different medications, nothing seems to be effective. My family physician told me to look into therapy, so this week I will be doing as such. Itâ€™s really hard for me to talk about my emotions and trauma, so taking the next step and seeking a therapist is going to be extremely hard. Nevertheless, Iâ€™m hoping itâ€™ll be beneficial to me. What sucks about allll of this, though, is I think I have to get in touch with a psychiatrist or other medical professional that can help me out with another mental health issue. I think I have BPD. I hate even saying that because I donâ€™t want to be the type of person to self-diagnose. Recently, though, Iâ€™ve done the research to try and understand why my medications werenâ€™t working and why my mental health seems to be all over the place. I never even considered the possibility of having BPD. But after reading about it and reading about how those that are diagnosed with it feel, it all seems to be adding up. I donâ€™t know. I guess Iâ€™m just having one of those moments where you think, â€œwhy would I have (______)? thereâ€™s no way I could.â€ But then all the signs point to it and it turns into a â€˜lightbulb over the headâ€™ moment. So anyways, Iâ€™m gonna look into getting that figured out,  too. A night where I thought I was experiencing the Sunday scaries turned into a lot of self reflection and admittance.

"Final attempt. I think I can explain this better tonight.

Hello to anyone reading this and hopefully your day went well today!ðŸ™Œ

Yesterday, I made a post talking about what I believe to be OCD and how it is exhausting me so much. I think I can explain it more clearly now. 

So what I'm going through is pretty unusual. I'll just get straight to it;

I have this thing where I would look up someone I find to have an attractive face. Basically a face I wish I could have. And aura too (yes it's as weird as it sounds ðŸ˜‚).  When I look them up, I will go to a mirror, and look at myself, and look at a photo of them on Google images and somehow expect my mind to perceive myself the same way as the person I've pulled up on the phone. Obviously this won't change my appearance. But my mind convinces me otherwise.

So I did this today about 3 times. And when I do so, I'm never satisfied with the perception I have of myself. When I look in the mirror, I genuinely do think I'm a fairly good looking guy.  With or without the photo pulled up.  When I stop looking at myself in the mirror though, my mind thinks of my face a certain way. 

For example: right now, after the last time I did this, I'm stuck at this delusional thought that my face is a bit bigger than it was when I did this the previous time. I know it's obviously not true. But I swear to you I can't find peace because throughout this day all my mind is telling me is that unless I do the mirror thing again, my face will remain bigger than usual for the moment.

Someone pleaseee help me!  Should I just do the mirror thing again? Or just force myself to live with this and hope for my delusional false thoughts to fade away?  I absolutely despise living like this. From the outside, people may think I'm fine, but I'm seriously fighting demons inside. My mind is a cruel monster. Never allowing me peace.   Please any advice/comment would help so damn much! ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ I'm begging!!!! And thank you so much for reading this btw, much appreciated!!!


Oh and another thing (Spoiler alert from the TV show 'Better call saul' down below)











If you've seen 'better call saul' , another way I could describe my delusion is like that of Chuck's. His 'condition' was pretty much his mind making him believe something that doesn't actually harm him but his mind is so powerful that he actually allows batteries to affect him negatively.  When Jimmy snuck a battery in his suit without him knowing, he didn't react negatively to it.  So it shows it's all in his head.  Sadly in the end he does go completely crazy and kills himself because of his mental illness.  I truly fear this for myself.",General_disorder

"Iâ€™ve never been diagnosed with a mental illness but I am in my head so much itâ€™s insane. I have considered talking to my doctor but figured I could ask here too. I am a 30 year old single male with no kids. I have always felt anxious in general and quiet around people until Iâ€™m comfortable. Iâ€™ve never been in a committed relationship and itâ€™s only getting harder to communicate. Dating in the past was normally one sided coming from the other end. I have real strong ocd tendencies and trust issues and when the conversation turns to my feeling I go silent or change the subject. So basically Iâ€™m always in my head wondering about my future, being alone, all my friendships, how to improve, where to improve. I just want to relax mostly but love all the things that keep me busy. Lately I have mostly cut contact with everyone and hangout with myself. A lot of times I feel like Iâ€™m being watched and get nervous. My few friendships I have are rocky. My fault for not reaching out and declining so much lately, acting insane when I do spend time together asserting my opinions trying to justify my boundaries. It always comes off wrong leaving my friends wondering. I storm off and hold grudges. At some point I realize Iâ€™m the asshole but I canâ€™t communicate this. I ignore and go off to do some activity. I was addicted between 19-23, using whatever starting at 15, from 24-28 I was completely sober working towards all my goals.  I believe I was having mental breakdown stressed out from work and started smoking weed again. For the first few months it did calm me down but made me stupid and lazy. I wasnâ€™t working towards my goals and my work situation only got worse before I attempted to quit. I was moved out of management back to my previous job. I was sad and definitely got some much needed sleep. Now I still struggle at times with my role and especially communication with my coworkers. If I smoke too much the day before work I have a cloudy negative mindset the entire next day at work. Iâ€™m now micro dosing and feel more confident at work but itâ€™s just weird too. Iâ€™m sorry this is all over the place I just donâ€™t feel like I can get anyone to take me serious and I canâ€™t keep living in my head.",General_disorder

"Posted in Relationship advice, but I wanted to try here too.
My bf(22m) and I(22f) were hanging out and drinking together the other night. We got into more serious topics of discussion, and he told me he doesn't feel like people actually enjoy his company, and he just feels like an accessory when he's around people.  He feels like they dont enjoy his company, and theyd be just as happy hanging out alone as they are with him. He has some self esteem and mental health issues, and had a serious panic attack late last year, that's left him more prone to smaller panic attacks. I know the best course of action is to get him in to see a doctor and a therapist, but doctors are so short here our clinic is booked up months in advance. I plan to slowly push for him to restart therapy, as the therapist he was comfortable with has left town. 

I'm just wondering if there's anything I could possibly do to help these feelings? I try to spend lots of time with him and be more inclusive, but I don't feel like its enough. I was thinking of cutting back on the time I spend with him and suggesting he picks up video games more often, as he has a group of online friends he seems happy to spend time with. If I were to open this as a discussion again, what would be the best way to reassure him that people love his company? I know people really do, he's genuinely a sweet person, I just don't know how to approach this.",General_disorder
"TW//brief mention of suicidal thoughts/delusions
sorry if this is kinda a run-on i just need to get it out. also just seeing if maybe anyone has experienced anything similar??
for some context i'm (21f) diagnosed w adhd/anxiety/depression. i've been on and off taking ritalin/adderal/vyvance since i was 11/12 and have tried a few different ssris since 12/13 but always seemed to have the worst/strangest side effects from any i took so i stopped taking any for a while. 
anyway , recently (like 3 months ago) i started having serious suicidal thoughts like i have never had in my life. before it went too far i forced myself to go to the doctor and get prescribed an ssri again, it's been so long since i had taken any i figured i could try something. my doc prescribed me wellbutrin, i didn't notice anything at all until about 3/4 weeks in. overall my mood/extremely short temper was seeming a lot better. but one day while i was at work everything was fine, nothing happened to set it off but i literally felt like i was playing a video game or something?? like i was watching myself do what i was doing but i wasn't controlling it. i cant even describe it but it was like a weird out of body experience . i went to the bathroom and just hyperventilated for the last few minutes of my shift and no matter how hard i was trying to calm myself down i felt like i couldn't come back into my body or something (i'm sorry if this sounds weird i just genuinely don't know how to describe it). i probably shouldn't have driven home like that but i did and again the whole drive home everything felt completely fake, i felt like everything i was seeing was just my imagination or that i was in a dream. when i got home i was scared to get out my car because i felt like someone was following me. when i finally ran up to my apartment i had this pit in my stomach and i felt like there was someone hiding somewhere in my apartment. i looked around everywhere just to have peace of mind. i have anxiety so obviously i have the typical anxious thoughts and feelings but i have never had any like paranoid(if that's the right word??) thoughts. i've been having thoughts/feelings like that ever since then. i feel like im being like watched or stalked or followed, or that i'm gonna get killed or attacked by someone (literally my close friends/family/coworkers/random kind stranger at the supermarket) but i am also conscious enough to kinda be able to tell myself it's not real? but i still am not ever fully sure or convinced that it's not? idk honestly i am just scared that im losing my mind or something, but i know that with like paranoid schizophrenia for example people truly believe their delusions wholeheartedly. sometimes i don't feel like i'm living in reality anymore and sometimes i feel just fine. i'm afraid to tell anyone i know or a therapist or something bc i don't want to get like involuntarily hospitalized or something. i don't know if it's for sure due to the medicine but it could be , at the same time i feel like it's helping my mood and my anger management. idk this has turned into a super long rant that it wasn't supposed to be but has anyone had a similar experience? advice ? words of wisdom lol literally anything to help me not feel alone",General_disorder

"Hello guys, Iâ€™m not a foreign speaker, so I may do some mistakes in my post.

Everyday I wake up, I feel terrible. The weight grasps me with every step. My mind is empty, and my feeling is numb. I have been shut in for so long that I could only find happiness through daydreaming and sleep. Up to a point that I started to see hallucinations, it was fine because I used to see the girl I love in my headspace.

Honestly, I don't think I have schizo but when I became stressed and felt unsafe, I was scared because I saw things that aren't human. They roam in my home, I can hear their steps, their voices. They usually look at me and disappear after a few seconds but they remain longer in the dark. They have blood skin and look human but not human. The worst is that they also follow me into my dream, the scariest dream I had was me in a really dark place and they did a massacre around me, I could hear humans screaming everywhere. I wish I could kill them, I get angry at them for making me scared but I can't because I do know they aren't real but they also feel so real. They are less likely to show up when I'm less stressed however, I am really scared of everything at night like they are still around somewhere I can't see.

I can also see them when I close my eyes. I usually said to myself that maybe it's just my brain trying to trick me and this is common to other ppl too but I'm not sure about it. I wish I could post a pic that describes what I saw.",General_disorder

"Hihi! I wanted some advice or maybe some stories from people who may have/are experiencing something similar. Iâ€™m not looking for anyone to diagnose me Iâ€™m just hoping i can hear from people who know what im talking about.

Theres multiple things i wanna talk about so bear with me lmao

1.) My entire life ive felt like everyone has some secret agenda to subtly psychologically torture me. Even when i was young (elementary school age) I used to attend an after school program and whenever i went to the bathroom i would peek through the windows to make sure no one was having some secret meeting where they talk about everything they hate about me and how to ruin my life. Itâ€™s so fucking annoying because even now that i know most people arent out to ruin my life (especially my friends) i still view everything as some sort of threat if that makes sense? Like my friends will say something to me and my mind automatically sounds alarms and shuts down and i can get kind of nasty (which is something im really trying hard to work on) and it hurts people around me even if they meant no harm. 

2.) almost everyday i wake up and wish i didnt (i am not at risk of suicide i promise) and i dont know what causes it i dont know how to stop it and its more of a nuisance than anything. I have no desire to live past 22 i dont wanna grow old i dont wanna start a family i dont wanna get a job or be successful bro i dont even wanna wallow but its all i have the energy to do. I canâ€™t bring myself to watch my favorite shows (except for the ones i can just run for background noise that i dont have to pay attention to) i canâ€™t bring myself to listen to my favorite songs anymore all i do is take care of my dog and my grandma. Everything just feels like its not worth the effort. Of course there are better days but the good days never seem worth bad

3.) Sometimes i get very agitated for no reason and i know thats normal (i think) but it feels excessive sometimes? Like its everyday all the time Ill be asked a simple question or someone will be talking for slightly too long and ill just be seething in silent anger. Ill legit damn them and their family to hell and back (in my head of course) for no reason. Its starting to affect me daily because of my home situation im asked to do things all the time and i get so mad that i almost send myself into hyperventilation or smth for no reason. 

Iâ€™ve looked done a little research on anxiety, depression, and bpd(2 specifically) and i see myself in a lot of the symptoms but idk. Anyway yeah! If you have any advice or experience with feelings like this please let me know (only if youâ€™re comfortable!) thank you for reading! Have a good day &lt;33",General_disorder
I want to do everything bad I can manage I need sensation. I want pain and to be numb. I want nothing and everything. Either I can't feel anything or I feel emotions in my skin like a fire. I don't know what I want. I don't know what I like because it depends who's around. I have to escape and I don't want to be within 100 miles of anyone but loneliness comes over me in waves. Everything is perfect until everything horrible. I have one type- damaged. I hate it and I love it. I hate myself more than I've ever hated anything and everyone else can fuck off too. Why does anyone put up with me? I make up these horrible imaginary scenarios in my head until they're real and I feel panic in every part of my body. I look for disapproval in everyone's face and give anyone anything until I think I don't see it. I want my head to shut the fuck up. I need to be punished. I need to hurt. I deserve perfection and I'm superior to everyone. I love then I hate there's no inbetween. I physically can't wait for anything I need everything in an instant and will die if I don't get it. I need to be hit. Knock my teeth in and choke me out. I can be one person one day and be a completely different person in 2 weeks. I've burned bridges with everyone who has ever been important to me. Please stay but also I hate you. Things and people and ideas are religions until they aren't and I throw them down. It's like I have no skin. I can never be satisfied. When I'm happy I'm sad about losing it- I need more. More is always better until I get bored. I want to be high every second of every day. I need silence. I'm drinking beer like water and edibles like I'm starving. Just to function like a normal person. I need to fight everyone but I need them to love me. I would rather be dead. I need darkness. I need sex but I need it harder and I need it to never stop. Fml I have to be up at 4 in the morning why would I agree to do things. I can't do anything.

"This started a couple months ago when I noticed that I fake and force out a lot of my emotions, since then Iâ€™ve been trying my best to stop faking emotions and have talked to my dad about all of this already but he doesnâ€™t believe me and thinks itâ€™s anxiety even though I havenâ€™t really felt anything towards this for months. I want to believe heâ€™s right and wanna have some â€œawakeningâ€ moment where I realize this was all just overthinking and I can go back to how I was before but I really donâ€™t feel anything anymore and have even noticed that Iâ€™ve become more manipulative recently.

But the thing Iâ€™m talking about tonight is the fact that I realized I donâ€™t really enjoy talking to people and realize Iâ€™m very different from the people I talk with online, I was In a call with them tonight playing Minecraft and while they were talking and laughing and cracking jokes I was just silent for the most of the call and really didnâ€™t feel a need or really wanted to speak. I felt bored, empty the whole time. I talked a few times here and there and I faked a laugh at some moments but like I said before I didnâ€™t feel anything.. I didnâ€™t wanna stay in the call and kinda just wanted to leave so I kinda just left a few minutes ago and decided to post here, could I have turned myself into a sociopath?

"So hi, I've never been on this thread before.

I usually stick to other places on the internet these days, rather than mental health or mental illness related communities.

I'm not sure why I disconnected from mental health spaces--I think that maybe it was the neuro-normativity. (I'm not in the mood to have some kind of discourse about what counts as neurodivergent or not. But I feel like mental health conversations are very centered around neurotypical people. It feels very ostracizing to have one huge portion of my identity--mental illness--be constantly discussed as though it can be fixed through getting a massage or practicing some rich-class centered form of ""self-care."" &amp; that's on neuro-normativity for the day, folks)

But I guess that's kind of an *example* of the thing I'm about to get into.

Online spaces are something... I used to see as a safe haven. They're a lot more welcoming than the environment I live in, in real life. I often feel really lonely and disconnected from everybody in real life, with... like, the exception of my best friend, and sometimes my mom and my sibling.

But I'm sure you all know that ""more welcoming"" doesn't always help.

Because sometimes I just feel like I'm more vulnerable to hostility than non-mentally-ill people. Like, it's really easy to find myself slipping into self-hate when I read something on the internet.

For example, I'm in a lot of social-justice related spaces, because that's something that matters a lot to me. Social justice spaces place a lot of value in particulars of language, how we refer to ourselves, how we refer to each other. And that's good, in my opinion, because I feel like a lot of minoritized people have been made to be the *last* voice anyone consults on how *their* identities are talked about. But on the internet, I feel like a lot of ""activists"" in ""social justice spaces"" tend to use many terms and ideas very flippantly, without giving them the proper weight and considering the nuances, especially if they're talking about an identity that's *not* their own. (Ironic, in my opinion.)

God, sorry, I'm sure I'm over-complicating this. 

Anyway, these spaces used to feel like a haven of new knowledge and suddenly a place where I was *accepted* and *safe* and it was okay to tell my story. In particular here, I'm talking about LGBTQ+ spaces, because I am an LGBTQ+ human (of some kind, not really sure *which kind* though).

But sometimes I feel like I get shut down really quickly. Like, if I have questions about a topic I don't understand yet, and I'm trying to ask those questions in good faith, some people throw shade. And sometimes I understand that, but they also do it in a way that's really ostracizing to someone who's neurodivergent???

So the way I *feel* when I say or do something wrong gets like, really magnified, really fast. I just kind of implode and spiral into self-hate, and it takes me forever to drag myself out of it, because I can't separate the fact that I am a human person who makes mistakes, from the idea that, surely, if I make a mistake, it must be because *I* am *a bad person*.

I try to not lash out in response, in situations like that, because I know when I feel like this, I'm not processing conflicts through a rational lens and then I can't really respond in a healthy way. I just try not to hurt people out in the online world, at least not *intentionally*.

But I think... it's when I'm trying to figure out when I'm the one who's actually wrong or not. In some circumstances I feel a little like I'm being bullied, but it's hard to tell, because ""*it's for the sake of discourse*.""

But I'm just increasingly feeling like some of my online ""safe spaces"" don't feel safe. And I think I need to figure out a way to separate myself from these spaces, because obviously it's not *helping* my mental illness.

But ""quitting social media"" cold-turkey, or whatever, doesn't usually work for me. I have ADHD (clinically dx age 10, if that's the sort of thing you guys care about). So, like, the internet is a source of dopamine for me. And because I'm both ADHD *and* depressed, giving up this particular source of dopamine tends to leave an unfilled dopamine well, where I get under-stimulated and... depressed.

I don't know. I am probably highly over-complicating all this.

But anyway. So, I guess I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to protect yourself better in online spaces, or how to replace the need fulfilled by social media. I don't want to forever separate myself from spaces where I've had good conversations or learned a lot about myself &amp; others. Online versions of this, however, just seem to slip into being toxic really easily, because it's so easy to type things anonymously and say mean things to people on the other side of a screen. Because they can't *see* you, and anonymity protects them from being held accountable.

And without the context of a real-life conversation, we're missing nuances, we're missing body language, we're missing elements that can give us context to how we respond to each other. (Though god knows, if politicians have done *anything* for me, they've taught me real life people are just as capable of treating each other like *crap*.)

And amongst all this... I know that my mentally ill brain is also isolating out the *worst* interactions I have and then *obsessively* ruminating about them. I know, logically, that the worst things that have happened online aren't even the rule, necessarily, because I don't even really post stuff that much?

But it still really gets to me when it happens. So.

(Also, I am posting this at 1:25am my time. So. Yeah.

I just... I kind of suspect that happens a lot on a thread about mental illness.)

Anyway. I'm just trying to use the best language I can to contextualize and explain my experiences, and I'm sorry if I used a lot &amp; talked too much about discourse. Apparently, I'm just one of those people who has to over-elaborate on *everything*.

If you have tips for any of the things I just wrote, big or small, feel free to share.   &lt;3",General_disorder

"I got married to a beautiful woman about 2.5 years back. It was an arranged marriage. However soon after marriage, there were clashes between me and my wife, based on very minute and small things, which started ruining our relationship. Those clashes bothered me a lot and I was always worried about the future of relationship. I'd faced anxiety issues and OCD few times previously and hence I started thinking negative and worst case outcomes obsessively. So whenever a fight happened between me and my wife, my mental health deteriorated, because of anxiety. I started getting sexual issues soon after marriage and was unable to perform sexually.
Then the worst thing happened - I lost my wife to dengue. She wasn't able to survive the infection and passed away couple of weeks back...
I still cannot believe she's gone and will never come back. I'm broken beyond repair.
I'm filled with guilt and shame. I hate myself every moment thinking that I couldn't give the sexual pleasure to my wife though she deserved it. I took various medications, but couldn't resolve the issue.
When I recall the hurtful things I said to my wife during our fight, I just want to kill myself... (although most of the time she was the one who initiated the fight, on many small issues which most people just ignore).

"My parents are forcing me to see a psychiatrist. I've seen a few. Im not into it. All I have is ASD. Im not sure of how to convince them I am fine. Well I have to see one and I really dont want to answer questions. I dont want to be prescribed stuff any more. What if it's a physical illness? I keep getting blood tests but they arent very conclusive in my opinion. Well I don't have any deficiencies or hyper/hypo thyroidism. I'm pretty sure it's something to do with my liver though. Plus I don't exercise much. It could be that. 


Plus I think I just experience things differently. Currently my doctors dont think so. They mention Bipolar, and Schizoaffective. I just dont think they got the right account of how things are. I've never had a manic episode, only depression. I've never hallucinated except for on weed or acid. I have hallucinated actually but I think it was just day dreaming or something like that. Plus it didnt cause me harm. Just a headache and a lot of confusion. The only thing I need help with is my lack of motivation. It's a really terrible feeling. Nobody seems to care about that though. I'm never depressed when I feel this way. It's just a weird feeling of detaching myself from things. It's like I dont enjoy things because why should I do them? It makes it hard to do things. Most of the time I just sit in the shower. 

I have a really hard time with seeing myself in the mirror lately. I just dont know how to relate to what I see. It's like I'm not me. I'm not allowed to really talk about certain things because I know people will react a certain way and I'm tired of reactions. I cant talk about how I feel. Its upsetting for other people. I'm on meds again because I quit taking them and it got out of hand. I quit for about 4 months. I've never been hospitalized though. It's been a threat though. 

I dont really know what to do anymore to be honest. I have very conflicted feelings about myself. I want good things for myself but another part of me hates myself and wishes bad stuff would happen to me. Honestly it's like I have no real idea of who I am. I have arguments with myself a lot. I'm really confused about my life. I'm at the age where I should be doing more with my life but I just dont think about it. I mostly sleep and stuff. I'm honestly scared to leave the house lately especially at night. I'm scared something really bad is gonna happen. But I dont quite understand why I'm scared of it because another part of me wants bad stuff to happen to me. I dont want bad stuff to happen. It's a part of me that is bad. I'm not fully me anymore.

Nobody understands. They just tell me to relax and quit being paranoid. I don't tell them about the part of me. They wouldn't care anyway. I'd get just get my medication upped. It's not like it really does anything. A part of me really wants it to not work because then it will prove that I dont need them. I'm sorry if this post barely makes sense.

So I feel uncomfortable around him. He obviously puts me second to most of the things in his life until itâ€™s time to post a picture of me on Facebook and get praise from his 6,000+ friends which most of them he doesnâ€™t know. They all praise him for being a great father meanwhile thereâ€™s my perspective over here (I just feel like he uses me for attention and doesnâ€™t care about what I have to say or how I feel). Whenever I rarely voice my opinion or tell him that Iâ€™m upset by the way he speaks to me he just knows how to start an argument with me saying me and my mom are trying to make him look like a bad parent. Really, my mom shouldnâ€™t have to defend me/my POV to him because he just doesnâ€™t seem to care what I have to say. He literally bullies me and has me crying for hours on end because of his narcissistic personality. Toxic masculinity. Even his mom would have to yell at him to get him to listen to what 14 year old me had to say. Without going too into depth, the amount of mental stress heâ€™s given me in the past 17 years has me drowning. It could be something so simple that he blows out of proportion by saying shit that no one should ever say to their daughter.

Literally degrades me while Iâ€™m standing in the back hallway telling me to delete the post (as if heâ€™s gonna fire me from my job?) the post is literally one sentence with no oneâ€™s name in it and I have no affiliation with anything virtually important to the company. I tell him ok well I get what youâ€™re saying but im not deleting the post, itâ€™s how I feel right now and you donâ€™t have a say on what I post on my private social media. He continues to bully me over the phone and tells me that if I donâ€™t want to listen to him then heâ€™ll just stop being a parent. On the surface that may not sound too deep but with our history and with what heâ€™s said to me before it just tore me up to be standing at work and hear him yelling at me like a small child. Im pretty emotionally unstable at times so now I find myself crying in the back hallway and begging him to not say that as his said similar comment before. Of course he makes it my fault and says heâ€™s never said anything like that to me before. The parent may not remember a comment like that but the child will likely remember that forever. I cussed him out and he asked me â€œwhere did you learn these words?â€ As if they were no-no words and that I need to listen to him and that I have no clue what Iâ€™m talking about. Then as you could imagine, after he basically condemns me HE TELLS ME HE LOVES ME BUT I SHOULD LISTEN TO HIM.  After explaining to my mom, once again she has to defend me against him and remind him that Iâ€™m not a child. Itâ€™s definitely a little thing that had nothing to do with him and he blew out of proportion but this is piled on top of almost two decades of me being knocked down by him. I havenâ€™t talked to him since. I feel like it would be so much easier to just cut him out of my life instead of going back and forth with him every couple months dredging up the same argument of me not being respected and the constant bullying. Most of my depression is because of him and his aggressive religious influence, his nonchalant attitude towards my feelings and his narcissism, needing constant attention from everyone else and never supporting me until itâ€™s convenient for him. 

Definitely didnâ€™t mean for this post to be so long but I just needed to get something out. I know I need to talk to a professional about my experiences with him.",General_disorder
"Hi. Iâ€™ve been dissociating for about 6 years now. Somewhere in my senior year of high school I began having issues with my vision, it was flashy and grainy and hard to focus. Where I once was able to perceive depth and scale was now flat and fuzzy. Memory slowly started to disappear  and  I started to lose control of my thoughts and imagination, dealing  with  intrusive irrational thoughts and fantasies. I began to lose  interest in  my creative hobbies and even music stopped bringing me joy.

Iâ€™ve seen a doctor who sent me to get my vision checked, but technically my vision is perfect. Iâ€™ve started seeing a therapist who seems to be more focused on getting me out of the house than on digging into why I dissociate. I'm not sure if I have trauma, and if I do I don't remember it, or it could be just a bunch of scattered things, but nothing specifically comes to mind.

About a year ago, when I started my gender transition, dissociation disappeared almost completely for a period of two weeks. I felt emotions much stronger, my vision was mostly back to normal, I could enjoy music again. I have no idea why it disappeared again. I take a micro dose of magic mushrooms every once in awhile as it brings me back, clearing up my dissociation though only for a short period of time.

Iâ€™ve started a bunch of healthy habits to hopefully help deal with the  dissociation, I do a lot of cardio exercise and go for regular walks, I eat well and practice intermittent fasting, I meditate every day for   about 10-20 minutes and I try my best to create digital art like I used to. I am able to feel excited about art at times, but it doesnâ€™t make the dissociation go away, none of it really does. It has me wondering   why Iâ€™m doing any of this in the first place.

I want to feel better. I donâ€™t want to dissociate another day in my life. Is there something Iâ€™m missing? Please help me.",General_disorder

This may be OCD.... I'm not sure but either way, it's mentally killing me lol.

Hello to whoever's reading this, and thank you so much for doing so!  I'm gonna try my absolute best to describe what I'm going through because it's pretty odd and straight up, weird. ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜‚

My mind is constantly playing tricks on me. I'm separating myself from my mind here because deep down, I know all the things I worry about, aren't actually there or haven't actually happened. But something in the back of my mind keeps saying ""you're lying!"". ""Go check it again. Repeat that. Repeat it again! Keep doing it.""

I'll give you some examples to give you more of an idea;

When I enter the bathroom, I'll lock the door, and know that it's locked. But my mind makes me look at it about 5 times to make sure it's locked. I swear if someone had a camera inside our bathroom and saw me looking at the door knob constantly, they'd think I'm deranged ðŸ˜‚ (I sadly might be?)

This one is complicated and will most likely make you think ""wtf is wrong with this guy??"". But lemme go ahead lol

The other day, I was actually looking up astrology and was pretty much obsessed with it. I truly don't believe in zodiac signs and all of that but again, that voice in my head keeps forcing me to believe in it.  Btw, to anyone who does believe in it, absolutely no problem with that. I just didn't want to believe in it because it overwhelms me and causes me to obsess over the traits I'm supposed to have and why I act like how I act. Sigh, I hope this is making sense lol

So I spend literally hours checking some famous celebrities zodiac charts and all, and I started actually making patterns in my head.  So I would say, ""oh me and him have the same sun and moon sign, we're actually the same person"".    

This may not sound like a big deal and I know it wouldn't be to any other person, but to me , it's more or less killing my peace.  I don't even feel real. I feel like I'm stuck in this state of my mind seeing myself as nothing special at all.  As if I've lost my identity and I can't see myself the same way.  

I absolutely WISH I never searched and obsessed about astrology.  


But that wouldn't erase this problem I have which is bigger than just my obsession with astrology.  It's pretty much my obsession with my mind not seeing flaws in anything.
Having to repeat stuff, and then overthink stuff.  Overthinking and being deluded is killing me, man.


I've tried my best to describe this.  I apologize if this doesn't make too much sense, it's really hard to explain it.  If anyone has read through this, first of all, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!! Much appreciated ðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ.  Secondly, if you have any advice, or help, or if you're going through something similar, pleaseeee let me know.  It'll help me so much!  I don't wanna be stuck in delusion and obsession.  I truly want and need help.  I've got a huge mental illness.  They say accepting that you have a problem is the first step to overcoming it.  I definitely do accept it. Once again, any advice or comment will help! Thank you!!!",General_disorder

"Hi, I'm on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues.

Recently, I've been starting to think that mental illness isn't real. Deep down I know it is real and that my thoughts are wrong, so I guess it's just that I don't want to believe that it's real.
Now I've started to believe that I'm not mentally ill (I have a diagnosis of anxiety and depression), and that I'm just broken and I've come to the conclusion that maybe God is real (I was an atheist or agnostic, not rlly sure which) and he gave me a curse to not be able to function normally.
For added context, I'm supposed to be getting an autism assessment soon but I don't really want to go. However in this case its not that I believe its not real, I just don't want to have autism.
Honestly I'm not sure why I'm having these thoughts. Maybe I'm delusional? Or am I just in denial?",General_disorder
"A few years ago I suddenly started feeling really stressed. I figured it'd eventually pass, but didn't. I started feeling anxious throughout the day. This went on for awhile before I decided to get some help. 

I started with an ER since I was having really bad anxiety and exhaustion. They ran several tests and everything was fine. I was told to follow up with my PCP. I made an appointment with my PCP and he mentioned stress. 

A few weeks went by and I still wasn't feeling myself. I decided to get a mental health assessment. I was told that I had stress and I was referred to counseling if needed. 

A few months into this I start hearing voices when I'm trying to sleep. I'd also wake up from weird dreams. I went to an ER since I was having hallucinations. They weren't much help at all. The next day I go to a Psych Center and sign myself in. After an assessment they send me home saying you have anxiety. 

It has been going on 3 years since this started. The anxiety has improved somewhat. I still get the voices when I try to sleep. I started worrying about this being signs of psychosis or schizophrenia. I go to my PCP and he said that it wasn't. So I'm still struggling with anxiety and having hallucinations.

"I come from a family where mental ilness is very common.
Dads side- Personality disorders, autism, depression, substance abuse and psychotic disorders
Mothers- OCD/hoarding, anxiety, depression, Personality disorder
So naturally... I'm mentally screwed too.
I receive DBT treatment for BPD and my life threatening self harm. My therapists (my individual and family therapist) want to have a meeting/session with my mother and I, as her hoarding has greatly effected our home and my life.
My mother has some narcissistic tendencies, so is extremely scared of being judged or thought about negatively, victim card in every sleeve and pocket. She doesn't want to/refuses to acknowledge her hoarding as an issue. Now that my therapist decided to have a meeting she's pissed at me because she knows damn well they will blame her for certain things, or like see it as a problem (because it is). And she's scared of 3rd parties judging her but I find it so comical.
I did everything I could to please her from a young age, even tho she treated me like shit and neglected me, so take the shit that you yourself served. My hope is that it will make her realize that ""oh shit i have an issue and it's effecting my family very negatively"". And then get treatment/get better. But as of rn, she doesn't want to get better, as she is blind to the fact of its massive problem. But what happens if the meeting goes down south, what should I do? Kms? Run away?

"I've been diagnosed with different things by different therapists and put on medication that didn't work or had poor side effects by different psychologists.

From my understanding my brain is psychologically weak. It had trouble doing things, focusing, being intelligent, poor sensitivity to time. Uncultured, lacks empathy, low social intelligence.

Then there are other things, like auditory processing disorder, poor function within sleep deprivation, and some sensory processing disorder as well.

Most touching in most environments doesn't feel pleasant, synthetic fabrics feel itchy, abnormally high pain sensitivity.

Its difficult to find help. In all my reading of psychological literature, I identify with having executive function disorder the most, but none of my therapists have diagnosed me with that, only with things that have executive function disorder as a symptom.

Okay so Iâ€™m a 19 year old girl and feel like I could have a lot of things. My dad has undiagnosed Autism and my mom is on anti-depressants. My grandpa had severe schizophrenia. When I was a child I moved from Scandinavia to California for 5 years and then moved back. My parents are together and things from the outside are good and normal.

-So I am an over-thinker for sure, on the other hand sometimes my brain shuts down in specific situations and I literally donâ€™t think at all. 

-Iâ€™ve had an eating disorder for 6 years now since I was 13 years old. First anorexia, then bulimia and now I binge eat daily.

-I get a lot of fomo, but donâ€™t like going out and socializing. I use a lot of energy analyzing people in conversations.

-Iâ€™m very self critical and donâ€™t trust anything I decide to do, so decision-making is the worst.

-I tend to over-understand people (or at least I think I do). Like I can sense peoples emotions as my own. If someone is hungry, bored, restless- I get all caught up in their world and then feel the emotion of that even makes sense?

-Iâ€™m very sensitive to sounds, smells and light- but only when I focus on it. My room is always messy, but I feel best in a clean and organized environment.

-I donâ€™t have any sense of time. Sometimes I want to get things done, but canâ€™t get my legs to even move.

-I feel like I hallucinate. I sometimes think everyone is looking and judging me and get very anxious for half an hour, but then when I finally look up, there are no people around me. My friends think Iâ€™m weird because I often think I hear them say things that they havenâ€™t, and then I comment.

"So this is very strange and has been happening for the last 4 years and has made my life completely debilitating. I donâ€™t know exactly where itâ€™s coming from or if itâ€™s natural and can be improved with psychotherapy. I used to listen to these audios on YouTube called Subliminals. Subliminals are made by repeating positive statements over and over again with the idea that they will reach your subconscious and make changes. These audios are supposed to be able to change your mindset, appearance, and bring things into your life by changing your subconscious beliefs. I used to listen to this channel named, mind power. I used her curly hair video and to my surprise, it actually worked. Or at least I perceived it as working. I changed my hair type from 3a to 3b curly hair.

The creator of these subliminals had her channel taken down in, 2018 after being exposed for using harmful affirmations. Shortly after using her audios, I had insomnia for the first time in my life. Terrible insomnia that lasted 2 weeks, I was micro sleeping on and off for 2 weeks straight. Sometime after I got over the insomnia, I remember waking up and the world felt artificialâ€¦nothing felt real anymore and everything just seemed colorless. I think this is called depersonalization. Since then, Iâ€™m chronically depressed, have severe brain fog, memory loss, personality changes, Iâ€™m apathetic, hopeless, have suicidal thoughtsâ€¦ but one of the strangest symptoms I have is that I believe that my skull is shrinking. It feels smaller everyday I wake up, when I touch it, it feels smaller and it looks smaller in the mirror. I have had both a cat scan and an mri and those test both confirmed that their isnâ€™t anything physically wrong with my brain or no signs of skull thinning. Would you consider this a delusion? 

I donâ€™t know if this is a result of her audios or not, but after listening to something called a subliminal flush, which is supposed to remove harmful affirmations from the subconscious, my skull was growing back in real timeâ€¦now I know this sounds insane, but through my perception and senses it felt like it was changing back to its original shape. Eventually the subliminal flush stopped working and my skull started to change shapes againâ€¦now it appears to be even smaller than it was before I listened to the flush. 

I made the ignorant mistake of listening to this guy named, sapien medicine on YouTube in may of this year and it has made my symptoms and quality of life much worse. Now I have suicidal thoughts in my mind all day long, music playing in my head all day long, even worse memory, and overall just feel like death. Iâ€™ll never be able to explain just how much suffering this has caused me with words aloneâ€¦I genuinely donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ve managed to not end my life yet.

Idk if this is all psychological or not or if their audios have had a real impact of my mind and body. I also have a long history of childhood trauma and maybe that could be playing a role. What do you think I should do from here? Thank you",General_disorder
"The first thing I remember is dreading family gatherings when I was a very young kid. I felt highly anxious going there, I kept to myself and hid in the bathroom, and I felt major relief going home.

As a preteen I had one really close friend and one or two casual friends. I always felt comfortable around them and going between our houses was never an issue for me. However, when it came to being in middle school, I kept mostly to myself and spent many lunches and recesses alone (often by choice, sometimes due to a lack of friends).

In high school as a teenager is where I really began to struggle. I was able to tolerate a small group of close-knit friends but I was always the butt-end of everyone's joking. When I began working part-time jobs I became overwhelmed with incredible, horrifying anxiety, which did not diminish with time. The more I went to work, the worse the anxiety became. My breaking point was at McDonald's when I realized I could not handle making burgers and I quit in tears. I then knew that something was wrong with me; I began therapy at the age of 16. It did not help. I went into complete social isolation. I did not go to prom.

In college I avoided people as much as possible. I could tolerate living in the big city downtown, but I avoided my roommates like the plague. Although I had many opportunities to network, I spent my free time alone, out of choice. I wanted to be alone. I dropped out after the first year and moved back home.

A year later in university (more my speed) I essentially replicated my college behaviour: avoiding my roommates; deliberately spending my free time alone. It was around this time that I realized I preferred to be alone, that I didn't derive much pleasure from social interaction. It was also around this time that I went on my first date with a woman, which ended horribly because I got really high one night and convinced myself that she was being unfaithful. I exploded on her and she cut me off permanently.

A similar thing happened later on with a close friend of mine. She was very busy, and I convinced myself that she didn't want to see me. I positioned myself outside of her house and told her I was there. She threatened to call the police and that broke me out of my psychosis. We're on good terms again but if you were to ask her, she would tell you that I was acting literally crazy at that time.

I have done other terrible things to people without ever realizing I was doing them. Some of my issues are more sinister. I can't work with people without feeling like the world is about to end; I work at an assembly line because machines make more sense to me than people do. I often distort seemingly innocent social interactions into wild and bizarre suspicions that people either hate me or want to ruin my reputation. I have managed to hold on to a few truly wonderful people who love me for who I am, but I have damaged many, many relationships otherwise. For the most part, I never realize what I'm doing wrong until it's too late. Then I beat myself up to hell and back.

I don't understand people and I always prefer to be alone. I have always lacked the desire to form relationships, especially with myself: I hate performing self-care / hygiene and I have numerous health issues because of that fact. I have no desire for sex or intimacy and I don't believe that I belong in bed with another person. I have no intention to raise children because I believe that I would psychologically ruin them.

All I can do is create art and study things I want to learn about. Those are the only things I am good at.

As a kid I would lie about people I was friends with, people Iâ€™ve dated, things Iâ€™ve done, places Iâ€™ve been, to anyone and everyone, these lies were so complex that everything tied together, no one knew I was lying cuz everything always tied back to each other, example: I went to Idaho on vacation with Blake and his uncle jay, I never said this exactly but yk what I mean, Blake wasnâ€™t real, uncle jay wasnâ€™t real, going to Idaho wasnâ€™t real but no one ever knew that because I wouldâ€™ve previously lied abt other stories of Blake n uncle jay n having family in Idaho and wtv, this was with every lie I did, thereâ€™s lies that Iâ€™ve been keeping up with anyone and everyone for years and years and years, even people who didnâ€™t previously know me, I would tell them the lie and keep going with it anyways, Iâ€™ve lied abt being addicted to drugs that I wasnâ€™t, places Iâ€™ve been, experiences Iâ€™ve had, people Iâ€™ve known and things weâ€™ve done together, what I had for lunch, random thing to make myself look better, people Iâ€™ve loved, things Iâ€™m gonna do in my day, hobbies, everything. The thing is Iâ€™ve never really had any real hobbies or interest or life experiences or anything, but I always lived my life as if I did, I lied about having anxiety disorder for so long as a kid that now I have one, I was so jealous and envious and sad that I never did anything all my other friends did, we were super poor, my dad was a raging alcoholic, mom died at 5, so I would just sit in bed and make up these lies and live through them, Iâ€™ve lied abt having sex before (havenâ€™t) being kissed before (havenâ€™t) having a relationship before (havenâ€™t) but in my everyday life a lot of these lies that Iâ€™ve put up for years and years and years, I live my day to day as if they actually happened, doing all the things in my life as if these were true when I know, they were all lies, I moved since a kid and now live on the country side, I barley see people or talk to anyone even over the phone especially people that have known me longer then 2 years, but I still keep up with all the same lies, i wouldnt say I make up new lies very often anymore at least not big ones that you have to keep up with, I thought that maybe I always kept up with those lies outta the fear of someone realizing I was a compulsive liar, but I moved. To a completely different area, and didnâ€™t stop, I even bring those lies to social media such as reddit n discord n everything, so even people that donâ€™t even know what I look like. I lied abt having a anxiety disorder till I got one, I lied to myself n everyone about loving this chick n being so attracted to her when really there was nothing about her personality that made me want her it was jus attachment n lies, until I became actually in love and obsessed with her for months and months, I wasnâ€™t rlly attracted to her actually personality just who she was to me since we were so close with each other (she was horrible n toxic n didnâ€™t even like me like that so it hurt no one but myself anyways) I completely believed this love tho, I would hurt myself constantly and beg for her back after she would block me or something. And it was all real pain I genuinely felt n ig this is the first time Iâ€™m saying that I never rlly was that into her in the first place, I started having panic attacks while in cars and Iâ€™m not rlly sure why, it started one random day outta no where n I donâ€™t even know when but I came to the conclusion that it was cuz I dissociated while in cars, but I wasnâ€™t, I believed this too not like believed that I felt dissociation while in cars but believed that it wasnâ€™t dissociating if that makes sense. Whenever I would tell my dad or my therapist or my psychiatrist or anyone I would always tell them it was dissociation, I went on to talk abt my dissociation problems with friends and new people I meet as if that was happening, but it wasnâ€™t, Iâ€™ve had a actual dissociation episode before, I know exactly what that feels like. I wasnâ€™t dissociating, I actually havenâ€™t dissociated since that episode but since I went with that native for so long now I freak myself out whenever I look at something because I feel that if Iâ€™m not hyper aware of everything it around me itâ€™s â€œdissociationâ€ but it actually isnâ€™t, this is just how I am now because I used to be so fucking anxious all the time n now Iâ€™m on medication for my anxiety. I would often lie about going through things that were much more then I actually went through, because my life was so sad, so fucking sad, but boring. Everyone else around me who was in constant pain always did something, they had a hobby that meant everything to them n was there escape, or they went completely off the rocker n started partying and doing drugs, or they had a complete awakening and started to search for the true meaning of life or something like that. But me, I never did any of that, I tried to have hobbies n such but i could never stay focused or motivated to do one things enough to learn it, that still applies to this day. I didnâ€™t have any urge to do drugs I was always too scared of death n dying since mom died. But I couldnâ€™t find any bigger thing to look at or a bigger meaning behind all the things that happened n all my problems, for a very long time itâ€™s jus like I was jus, there. Itâ€™s like all my childhood was a weird blur, a blur I could remember, but itâ€™s like every single day was completely thoughtless b empty for me, obviously I had thoughts n emotions everyday then but I canâ€™t remember any of them like at all, I would sit in my room watching YouTube videos all. Day. Long. I loved music, I still love music but since the stuff with the girl itâ€™s hard to listen to music without thinking about her. But I still love music, as a rlly young kid my dad would play music and cry after my mom died, ig I didnâ€™t like my dad crying or I was scared of those emotions, cuz I pushed music away for a rlly long time after that, I couldnâ€™t listen to it or hear it especially around my dad without being extremely uncomfortable, around 11-12 is when that started to go down but I still wouldnâ€™t listen to music in front of my dad, so I would take a lot of walks, I walked A LOT, there was a park near my old house which I also used to go over too and listen to music while on the swings. But I would walk miles and miles a day, hours and hours, at least 2 hours a day, sometimes 8 hours a day. I would wake up on the middle of the night to just go and walk around listening to music, when I had the urge to walk I had to, even at school, when I had the urge to walk I would walk out of my class (was never good at school, as I said I could never focus and reading has ALWAYS given me a headache) and I would go behind a building or onto the track, n just listen to my music and walk. I still walk often and have that â€œI need to walk nowâ€ feeling in my mind and my legs. Rewind back tho, my sadness was always kinda jus there, I was sad very often, but very content ig, none of what I was feeling towards my situation made any sense to anyone, when I would tell people these things they would always invalidate me, n never take me serious ever, they thought that since I was just walking thru everyday with a very content mind just soaking in everything ig, that I hadnâ€™t had that had of a home situation, so I started exaggerating how I actually felt, when things in the home got very bad (aka when my dad started drinking after work) ig I would jus go on a walk, i would walk around looking at the sky n the sketchy motel across from me, i would sit at the gas station n chill, idek i would jus walk, n listen to my music, my mood was always sucked into my music, I would completely immerse myself into my music n it like I would become apart of the song ig, but no one believed how sad n how bad my situation actually was, i never tried to run away, I always tried to help my dad, I never wanted to cut or do any of the unhealthy mechanisms people use to cope at such young ages, or the healthy ones. I jus wanted to walk, when I walked it was like I became apart of my own little cartoon, I always thought If I was in a cartoon. Not like trippy psychedelic everyone looks like a cartoon but like, I would imagine all cars passing were cartoon cars, I would make up full story lines between me n people I see on the street or people at my school, whenever I went on my walks it felt like I was writing a story. I could find a story in anything.  since no one believed me about my struggles, I would exaggerate until people payed attention, n cared, n validated my feelings, I started talking about how miserable I was, n all the unhealthy mechanisms I was using even tho none of it was tru, I lied about fighting people and always being angry, but ig the feelings slowly started to manifest itself, cuz now 16 years later Iâ€™m typing this out as the first actual time I acknowledged all the things Iâ€™ve lied about, and the things in my day to day life that I try to â€œfixâ€ but ultimately wont cuz Iâ€™m making up lies about why Iâ€™m feeling the way I am.

"Schizoaffective diagnosed with extreme anxiety/agoraphobia and some OCD in the mix for fun.

I have been seeing my therapist for 3 months. Since then my mental health has absolutely tanked. My therapist is, on a good day, somewhat helpful. On a bad day, condescending. She made fun of the fact that I struggled with disordered eating (said that she could never have an eating disorder and that she loves food too much) and then tried to tell me I was self diagnosing and I was dumb for doing that. 

Sheâ€™s made fun of my agoraphobia (telling me Iâ€™m not agoraphobic Iâ€™m just insecure about my body and have social anxiety) and told me Iâ€™m not really schizophrenic. (I am diagnosed and medicated by a psychiatrist). 

I have since had to up my depression medication and Iâ€™m so stressed I fell into a manic episode 3 weeks ago. I have been struggling to go to appointments for my therapist and my case manager because of my depression. And they have done nothing but guilted me about it. They keep harassing me and shame me when I do finally show up.

I know itâ€™s not just me because I always go to my psych appointment on time and have generally no issues, my psych is very kind, compassionate and is always patient with me. 

Mentally Iâ€™m really down today and I canâ€™t handle it, I donâ€™t want to get hospitalized because of MY OWN care team. 

On top of that I had an appointment today with my case manager and she just badgered at me about not answering her phone call earlier in the week (I was in class and I just forgotten to call her back), and when she asked me about how I was doing in school, and I told her I got a great score on my exam; she just used that opportunity to tell me about how good she was in the subject and how it would be easy for ANYONE.

"I (F25) For more than 10 years have wanted to end my life but they were nothing more than intrusive thoughts. About a year ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and anxiety about two years ago. The truth is that I always saw a light of hope when I had days, weeks in which I only thought about how much I hated being alive. Even with the medicines, even with the therapy, nothing has changed or I only have very short moments where I really want to ""live"". I had never had a specific plan yet and recently I finally started with one. Mainly I am going to pay off the debts that I have and then I will sell and give away some of my belongings that are expensive. I always thought that taking my life was something selfish because my mom (who has anxiety for as long as I can remember) and my dad were going to suffer a lot and I am almost sure that my departure would destroy their lives and they would become miserable. My mom only has me, since my dad is not very close even though they live together. I'm already at a point where I don't mind being ""selfish"" because I've already endured 10 years of being miserable. And the truth is that I can no longer stand having contact with them or with anyone. I just want to finish everything at once. 

Another thing I have thought about doing is managing to talk to one of my closest friend, so he would find my body and for my parents I would only tell them that I â€œleft the countryâ€, and that I do not want to have contact with them again. 

My question is, for the parents who are here, would it be less painful to know that their son committed suicide, or that he ""left the country"" and never contacted again? 

I want to cause as little pain as possible to my family",General_disorder

And it affects my social life (at least i think it does, none of my friends have said anything and theyre honest), i just seem that im the most annoying person to myself but at the same time the funniest, but also lowkey depressed, but also super outgoing (im really starting to go off-topic here, sorry), like my friends and i will be laughing like CRAZY and making jokes and adding more and laughing more and i say some super unfunny shit and like I KNOW ITS NOT FUNNY AND I DONT EVEN COME UP WITH IT but no, i have to be on that dumb shit like why cant i be normal. nobody tells me im weird and i am popular, but i dont seem to think that im any of those to myself it only depends on my mood and i always overthink shit (not relationship overthinking) like oh this, oh that, and even when im with the same people that i assume ill get judged, they never judge, we never judge, theyre great people idk why i think this stuff.",General_disorder

I was bullied a lot and cast out when I was younger, and I donâ€™t want people to ever feel the same as I did. I didnâ€™t realize it at the time, but I truly felt so alone. But itâ€™s so difficult to protect people when the one time Iâ€™m vulnerable and show someone that I really care about them, they call me sensitive.

Also i have a fan in my room that is has a timer function that beeps when u press it. 3 days ago i was just chilling and i just hear the beeping from my fan and look at it and see the light flashing on and off. It stopped after a while and i asked my sister who was closer to it why she didnâ€™t turn it off. She said it never was on in the first place.Yesterday i was having my earphones at max volume and heard a loud fly bussing noise even through my head phones and even saw it flying around.

But then he just randomly pulls up his sleeves to show me what look like scratches idk but they were basically showing me their self harm. I genuinely didnâ€™t know what to do or say, but I ended up just saying I hope things get better.

I was so upset afterwards because why would someone do that ? Iâ€™ve only been clean for like a week and well it just all went down the drain after that.

I rode on the swings and slid down the slide. I actually enjoyed myself for the first time in years. I actually got a little emotional thinking about old times. My childhood was kind of shitty but there were some good moments. Also, it mustâ€™ve rained the night before because I slid down the slide right into a puddle. My new shorts got soaking wet.

Hello everyone,

So I know it's not wise to self diagnosis myself and I've seen multiple different therapist (psychologist and psychiatrist) regarding this and nobody really answered this question for me.

So around 2014-2017 I was heavily abusing adderalls and cannabis. I have stopped consuming adderalls completely after college early 2017 and reduced my cannabis usage by half.

I picked up modafinil around the end of 2017 because I couldn't stay awake for work which now I realized was possibly due to experiencing withdrawals from the adderall abuse.

Since end of 2017 up until 5.5 months ago (2022) I was taking modafinil/armodafinil every single day.

I completely stopped cannabis usage around mid 2021.

Now that I am off it, a whole bunch of weird things has been happening to me in what I assume is my brain recalibrating itself.

Now that I am off the drugs, I'm starting to realize how crazy I behaved when I consumed modafinil. I was hostile towards people.

I was extremely grandiose to the point where I was delusional about my life. I thought I was gifted/genius. I was literally convinced I was a genius without even being tested or any evidence as I only did enough to pass my classes in school. I thought I was smarter than all of my therapists after reading a couple of comments on reddit/quora regarding psychology.

I was paranoid that my father would set up listening/recording devices in my apartment when he would visit.

I socially isolated myself from everybody. Now I am going over 2 years without any sort of interaction from people my age.

I have more symptoms but these are the main ones that I can think of right now. I never hallucinated visually. I've had auditory hallucinations in forms of sounds like bangs and thumps (not voices) but this only happened right before I went to sleep.

once I stopped taking modafinil and became sober all of these symptoms slowly started to become opposites more or less.

Would a mild form of psychosis without visual hallucination symptoms look like this?",General_disorder
"so since august ive had a stroke and broke up with a toxic girlfriend of 3 years moved back in with my parents and have been doing absolutely nothing for myself and smoking weed. yes yes ik no shit your sad right? just wait 

to put into perspective my sister who lives like 2 hours away offered to get me out of the house and stay with her for a few days and for some reason i thought this was a good response

â€œive become much too pessimistic and negative to have around and be in constant discourse with, though i really appreciate the offer. i think back to when me and xxxxxxx first moved in together (it felt like i couldnâ€™t escape from all the negativity) and i wouldnâ€™t wish anything similar to that onto anyone, let alone my sister.  so im not going to put you through that. again though thanks for the offer.â€

way to make her feel like shit just for reaching out right? and it took me 30 whole fucking minutes of revising before i decided the text was perfect. revising??? for my sister??? 

im too far gone and if any of you have nothing better to do you can read my mini mid life crisis below. 

i might talk in circles and sound weird but this was originally just for myself in my notes and suddenly decided i want the opinion of reddit

in doing this im literally setting myself on a path of self destruction. ik my parents wont ever pick up on my subtle/notsosubtle suicide hints and my sister is the only one who would actually do any real digging on whats inside my brain. so by saying no im getting rid of the only good outlet in my life right now. idk maybe im an attention seeker, maybe i actually have a problem, maybe i just dont want to bother other people(the answer to each of these is yes). but what i feel, is that im trying to find my breaking point and see if anyone cares enough/is paying enough attention to me to see me looking for my breaking pointâ€¦ im self aware enough to realize YES this IS attention seeking with with a sad excuse. and yes this is a mental heath problem. 

so ik i have a problem and i need help. so why dont i get some? im just shitty and my ex has made me shittier. im very much struggling with self worth. and i cant find a reason to fix it

ive fucked up big time in the past and so the possibility getting famous is out of the question.

im a straight white guy so im already racist and misogynistic by default

THE FUCKING JOB MARKET

THE FUCKING HOUSING MARKET 

THE FUCKING GLOBAL WARMING

and the fact i believe the human race is a parasite to begin with, the less of em the better and yes that includes myself






well now aint that some dAngErOUs talk.

Hi!

Don't know where to post this I figured this might be a good place maybe someone had similar experiences.

I don't think its a serious issue or I have DID, in fact I'm almost sure I don't have DID.

I'm 21, I had a rought time in the last 4-5 years, I did struggle with some childhood trauma which I think I succesfully overcome but new ones emerged in the last 1 year due to my relationship with my ex who is a narcissistic with a hysteroid personality disorder.

After the break up, dunno maybe its just my coping mechanism but its starting to annoy me because it affects my daily life.

One day I'm serious, introverted, hate social media presence what so ever, like to dress in very masculine clothes, I got told I even speak with a deeper voice during conversations, a bit boring I would say, just a very one lane forward type of person, I get up, go to work, game at home a bit, repeat.

The other day sometimes its different, I hate the clothes I bought when I was in my ""more serious mood"" I like to dress a little more ""alternative"" (I had my emo/goth etc phase which seems like still hangs to me), I'm extroverted hungry for interaction, I'm bored at home and hangout in the city, I draw and I make plans to be a tattoer (I'm a software developer wtf) I like to post on social media from selfies to sketches I made etc, like I'm a whole different person from yesterday.

And this changes sometimes day to day.
Don't know if its normal or not but wanted to reach out because it is starting to feel odd and a bit difficult to manage my day to day life.

I just hope someone understands me here and could give me an advice ðŸ˜…

"do i suck?

Lemme walk you through a bit, I'm in 9th grade now from kindergarten to grade six I was at one school and changed for 7 to 8 and just changed to a new high school. EXHIBIT 1 - I had these two friends since grade 4 and they were nice but by grade 6 I was just hanging out with them to be nice and now they want to hang out so I'm avoiding him

 EXHIBIT 2 -  during grade six I really liked this girl but I had never really admitted it to anyone before, so what I did was I started messaging her and some other people in her class, and for some reason I told one of the other girls in the class that she had asked me out, and that girl then asked the girl I liked if this was true which she replied it was not, she then confronted me to which I never replied and just cut her out of my life. That's when my depression really started.

EXHIBIT 3 - grade 7, my depression is in full swing and I'm at a new school so not wanting to be left in the corner I was constantly putting myself into other people's conversations and though nobody said anything I can tell not they really hated me.

EXHIBIT 4 - now I'm super depressed, we talking sh, suicidal thoughts ( I was SUPER close to jumping off a bridge once but I couldn't because of my grandma) although I do have some friends and am fairly well liked in the class, but now I like this other girl, and after my last experience I decided I was not going to do anything about it, but then she starts talking to me and we start to be friends somewhat, and what we did was sometimes when she wanted to she would ask me to do therapy and she would tell me all her problems and I would help her out, now after that I got more comfortable and I told her about my depression and then felt awful about it, like I had just dumped the massive thing onto her and now I'm just this guy who uses depression as a light conversation starter and I hated myself for it, I cut myself so bad that night that I lost a chuck of my ring finger.

No fucking job, no licence, no experience.

In every aspect I feel like I'm just fucked. I have so much stress right now I feel like I could explode.

"I just I just got a job working at a college through a teaching agency. The college have already given me the position, however, the agency will not let me start until I get my GP to fill out a form confirming I am â€œfit to workâ€. This is because I disclosed I am autistic, have suspected BPD, am on medication, and have received long-term psychiatric treatment. No other agency Iâ€™m with, even the ones who know about my mental health, have asked for this. 

Iâ€™m a bit worried because it has to be my GP who fills out the form. He barely knows me beyond a few notes on my medical files and has been judgemental in the past regarding self-harm, my autism diagnosis, and BPD stereotypes. 

The gist of the form is: â€œthe candidate ticked â€˜yesâ€™ on having Mental or psychological conditions and have seen a specialist (psychiatrist/psychologist) and requires required medication for longer than 3 months. Please confirm their medical fitness so we can verify their fitness to work. Health Standards England Regulations 2003.â€ And the questions are â€œIs the candidate fit to work in Education, including having sole charge of minors in a â€˜robustâ€™ environment?â€ And â€œDoes the candidate have conditions that the college would need to be aware of in order to protect them and the safety of the students?â€

Are they legally entitled to ask for this or could it be discrimination? It seems like the second question is more about accommodations, but could it backfire if the GP decides to answer the first question with a stigmatised perspective on my conditions? I feel like my medical history from seeking an autism diagnosis and getting treatment for C-PTSD is being treated like a criminal record. 

Not sure if Iâ€™m overthinking it. Iâ€™ve made an appointment with my GP to sort this form. But if I have the right to tell them to shove it, I will on principle.",General_disorder

"Okay. Someone, please tell me I'm not alone.

Everyday, seemingly all day, I have a headache. It varies in it's pain and sensation.
 
I also feel like I'm mentally dragging my way through molasses, which also varies in intensity. 

It seems like in social situations, it's so much worse. I don't know what I'm saying. Don't know what I'm thinking. Or how to even feel. 

When I'm alone, it's a bit better, but can be just as bad. Especially if I'm inactive, it seems like my brain becomes a brick of cement and I can't do anything. I have to physically drag myself to every task.

The only thing that gives me relief, from the pain and the grogginess, is just being outside. But I still struggle with mental clarity. I still feel absent minded and bored.

I don't understand what is happening but I feel like an incapable husk of a human being. Work, social, passion, fun...all areas of my life are affected. I feel so confused.

Does anyone else experience this?

I have a few candidates for what this is. I can't seem to narrow it down to a possible cause and so idk how to approach this. I know it started three years ago, when I started ADs. But even when I went off, the feeling didn't go away.",General_disorder

All of this and more while i couldnt bring myself to do anything, not even school stuff and my mom did nothing other than make it worse by telling me stuff that i wont share.

I would like to say more but i dont really want to, so ill cut it dont to ""i may have ADHD"" and just get to the point.

Im really insecure about telling my mom cuz she sees me like im completly fine mentally and that im just lazy and get distracted easly, on the other hand, my dad, i feel like im a bit more confident beacuse i feel he loves me unconditionally (at least thats what he says) and hes the one that holds most of our money, but the thing is we're not doing really well financially and this is one of the reasons why i didnt want to ask them, but at the same time i just cant keep going like this, im tired and i cant keep doing this, that one voice in the back of my head telling me that im not worth it, but the characters i made up in my head due to daydreaming are telling me to get help, and i feel like im going insane

" 

Hi.    Iâ€™ve been dissociating for about 6-7 years now. Somewhere in my  senior   year in high school I began having issues with my vision, it  was flashy   and grainy and hard to focus. Where I once was able to  perceive depth   and scale was now flat and fuzzy. Memory slowly started  to disappear  and  I started to lose control of my thoughts and  imagination, dealing  with  intrusive irrational thoughts and fantasies.  I began to lose  interest in  my creative hobbies and even music  stopped bringing me joy.

Iâ€™ve    seen a doctor who sent me to get my vision checked, but technically my    vision is perfect. Iâ€™ve started seeing a therapist who seems to be   more  focused on getting me out of the house than on digging into why I    dissociate. Not that I have any significant trauma anyways. I had a    panic attack at work onceâ€¦ a lot of heartbreak in highschool. Nothing    that necessarily hurts to think about. Iâ€™m going to be seeing my doctor    again soon to hopefully get me to see a psychiatrist.

About    a year ago, when I started my gender transition, dissociation    disappeared almost completely for a period of two weeks. I felt emotions    much stronger, my vision was mostly back to normal, I could enjoy   music  again. I have no idea why it disappeared again. I take a micro   dose of  magic mushrooms every once in awhile as it brings me back,   clearing up  my dissociation though only for a short period of time.

Iâ€™ve    started a bunch of healthy habits to hopefully help deal with the    dissociation, I do a lot of cardio exercise and go for regular walks, I    eat well and practice intermittent fasting, I meditate every day for    about 10-20 minutes and I try my best to create digital art like I used    to. I am able to feel excited about art at times, but it doesnâ€™t make    the dissociation go away, none of it really does. It has me wondering    why Iâ€™m doing any of this in the first place.

I want to feel better. I donâ€™t want to dissociate another day in my life. Is there something Iâ€™m missing? Please help me.",General_disorder

But I find myself constantly going back and forth in my head and sometimes (rarely) out loud seeing them as good than bad. And no one is perfect and everyone has bad moments. But I feel like Iâ€™ll be so happy with them, no worries, they are the best human (sometimes to idolized point) and then itâ€™s like I flip to looking at every little thing they do and come up with a big conclusion that they are manipulative and horrible (once again to a very extreme hatred point) idk how to ever even tell them cause like I feel like shit when I hate on them internally.

" Hi everyone,

In this post I'm covering my history and medicines/supplements I'm on. I've gotten so much better.

I have schizoaffective disorder as of 6 years now and have been through the same kind of life most of you I believe. I don't know anyone with bipolar or schizophrenia. In and out of treatment 7 times, substance abuse, dozens of meds etc. My fatigue has been growing so bad recently until I started taking NAC. N-acetylceistine, an amino acid from NOW Foods. I have been able to get back to the gym for the first time in 4 years due to this! I used to be 220 6'2 all muscle at 21. Used to be on the deans list managing a partnered twitch stream and yt channel, etc. I've found contentedness in my life now on disability for now.

Pics of me before and after illness. I have looked MUCH worse, this is me today in the second picture.

[https://imgur.com/a/NUBSx0Y](https://imgur.com/a/NUBSx0Y)

I'm a bit heavier now due to all the meds but am steadily losing weight again so too timid to post my body. I'm seeing a dietician so things are turning around. I had severe depression at 12, crippling anxiety where I'd throw up at school and cry to go home in middle school, drugs at 16, suicide attempt at 17 and 6 months of wilderness treatment afterwards. More residential treatments etc that were I believe to be unnecessary when it was just a med adjustment I needed. Some boarding school. So things get better with meds and high self esteem/experience. Anyways.

I was sleeping 16 hours a day a month ago until I tried this medicine.

Just a bit you should know about NAC. You need to take a multi-vitamin with it as well as glycine because NAC depletes Selenium, molybdenum, b6, b9, b12 and glycine (From what I've read online). I take a NOW Foods Multi-vitamin. I think NAC also reduces copper. I had great results the first week I took NAC then got really, really, tired and felt like I was being suffocated with a pillow. I started the multivitamin and within 2 days was even better then the first week. I've upped my dose from 1 gram to 3 grams of NAC. I won't go higher than this. Start at one gram for a few days (you may feel bad for a day or two) but try to stick with it for a week. You should notice a difference in a few hours. It makes some people tired. 3 grams is pretty high but it's what I need.

I have tried several other nootropics such as Piracetam, Aniracetam, and Phenibut. Phenibut is legal but can be addictive if taken too often so I take it about twice a week, around 2-3 grams. It works on gaba (like benzos, but this is not recreational) receptors and dopamine. Piracetam ruined my life for a week. I like Aniracetam a lot before the gym or just twice a day because I like it. It feels like a better caffeine. I've been sober for a while now.

I'm looking forward to making more friends online as I really don't know the extent of this disorder. Feel free to DM me! I think my reddit dms are open. I have some questions, too if you want to comment.

Do you guys just feel weird all the time? Like the world is surreal? Strange sensations you can't really describe? Like how you used to feel years ago was much clearer and you could do more?

Oh, I take Saphris 20mg at night, Lithium 300mg twice day and Caplyta 42mg at night along with Vitamin D. Oh, and Potassium and Magnesium Aspartate 250mg at night. These entirely manage my hallucinations and delusions.

I may add people on Discord after I get to know you, I'm just not sure yet lol. Probably won't do voice calls as I don't trust the anonymity of online. Hope to see some comments!

If this post gains traction I'll update it with new supplements I find that work for me. Going to try Maca, Cordyceps and Sarcosine next.",General_disorder
Like for me I just want to know most peoples opinions. When you look it up it says it is a lifelong debilitating mental illness. But honestly it seems like itâ€™s just a â€œmore colorfulâ€ and harder life like super high highs and lower lows is the illness. Like I donâ€™t see how that is such a mental illness that needs drugs to cure I donâ€™t know. But also I know itâ€™s good to destigmatize mental illness but Iâ€™m also just keeping it real I have received lots of stigma from having this. Never felt mentally ill I was super smart in hs got good grades and had lots of friends. But getting told Iâ€™m mentally Iâ€™ll really did something on me. And this Q and A wasnâ€™t supposed to be about me lol. I donâ€™t know it just sucks like I donâ€™t want to view myself as mentally Iâ€™ll it makes me feel fucking retarded especially when the drugs they put me on to â€œfixâ€ my brain just make me slower and stupider while feeling like I have the worst hangover of my life and when Iâ€™m not on them I can get by just fine and no one thought I had a mental illness. So yeah I guess Iâ€™m realizing bipolar is a mental illness  but I dont know itâ€™s just so stupid like when ur getting told ur emotions and moods like arenâ€™t correct like as if they dont correlate to something in your life like you just get them. Im also aware this is a very poorly written paragraph it is simply a feelings dump at this point but I hope you still answer the question and answer lol.,General_disorder

"I couldnâ€™t go to school last year, had to have an IEP and it made me super miserable. 

To start off, I talked to my principal about me struggling with mental health, having panic attacks in school etc, so she told me that I could do an IEP. I saw it as the best option available at the time and since I go to a private school with only 120 students, I thought the teachers would make time for me and learn about whatâ€™s going on.

Well, I was dead wrong.

The teachers that were supposed to help me through the study materials complained about it constantly to my classmates and forgot about me on a regular basis. Theyâ€™d just leave me at home without any instructions at all, not even informing me about important tests.

On the days that I did come to school, the teachers absolutely disregarded my accommodations, since it was easier for them. My classmates saw me hyperventilating and decided it would be funny to imitate me and mock me.

My parents, on the other note are supportive, however all this was new for them and they were absolutely clueless about what to do, so I ended up suffering for 8 months straight.

My parents are also super against me changing schools and I donâ€™t blame them. I completely understand their point of view and since there arenâ€™t many school options for me where I live, I decided to stay at this one. I have two years left at this school and have zero idea about how Iâ€™m supposed to make it through.

"Ok so Iâ€™m pretty sure i have some kind of disorder. I might be subconsciously faking it but read the rest and please tell me if there is anything similar. 

So i think whenever i find out about a disorder i â€˜fakeâ€™ it. But i donâ€™t mean to?

When i first found out about Touretteâ€™s syndrome, i would twitch my head. I donâ€™t know why. At one point it would actually do it by itself. This sounds really attention-seeking-like but i wasnâ€™t doing it for attention. If anything i hate attention

Once again when i found out about schizophrenia, i â€˜fakedâ€™ it. 
So i found out about it from this tiktok of a guy with schizophrenia and he was drawing what he thought the voices in his head looked like. 
I thought that was cool (for some reason) and i drew a little face in the same style. I called him Lenny. 
And some how i started seeing him on walls, tables, dark corners etc. 

2-3 weeks after each of those things i â€˜forgotâ€™ to do them and the tics would just stop and Lenny was nowhere to be seen

There is more tucked away in my brain but i canâ€™t remember for the life of me what it is. 

Donâ€™t know if this is related but i used to (and still sometimes now) not be able to close my eyes in the shower because i feel like Iâ€™m about to get stabbed. Again might be worth noting, might be something completely different.

"Thereâ€™s these things about me, which i think are kinda strange, i searched them up and they are apparently traits of mental illnesses. if they are could someone tell me what symptoms of metal illness(es) they are?

example 1: so iâ€™ve never been the loud or conversationalist type, iâ€™ve always seen myself as introverted but in 2020 september, i started school like 4 months after my mom passed, and thatâ€™s when things started getting worse. i hate the idea of going to parties, being surrounded by people who i donâ€™t know.  i have this huge fear of being judged by others, or being embarrassed publicly. speaking in public is the absolute worst, my heart races, my palms are sweaty, even after the fact, iâ€™m still thinking about whether people were laughing, or if they liked it. the day before school i always have this sick feeling in my stomach as if i havenâ€™t been there a thousand times before. itâ€™s so strange 

example 2: a couple months ago, i got some new furniture for my bedroom, and i set it up by myself. however after that my room was messy with my clothes and books everywhere. i know my room needs to be cleaned, but iâ€™m so unmotivated to do so, iâ€™ve been trying everyday since june. even with showering, like i know iâ€™m supposed to, but it feels like so much work and itâ€™s so difficult to drag myself in the shower most days. iâ€™m not a generally happy person, reason being which i donâ€™t really feel like saying, but itâ€™s something that makes me sad that i might not experience as a teenager, and i live in constant fear of my dad because i genuinely believe heâ€™d take my life because of it. i also rarely cry, so rarely that my eyes burn whenever i do. the last time i cried A LOT was my moms death, i saw it all, i didnâ€™t even cry that much at her funeral, shed a few tears but not nearly as much as when she passed. now when i do itâ€™s every couple of months over something small that triggers me

example 3: for these 2 iâ€™m not really sure if it could be a symptoms of mental illness, as theyâ€™re both quite random but here goes. so i think id call myself a smart guy, or at least i used to be, back in like primary school. i used to be able to read something over a couple times and id remember it easily, now, itâ€™s hard to stay focused when i do. i have to read it quite slowly and multiple times to process what i read. and not even with books, iâ€™ve gotten very forgetful. and the other thing is how i focused on something 1 minute and completely discard it the next. for example, i really got into books a few months ago, and now i struggle to read because of how disinterested i am. it happens with a lot of things, being really into this thing for like a month and then idc about it anymore",General_disorder

"I've had this my whole life. Most of the time I just have annoying mood swings throughout the day. I wouldn't quite say that they are in the normal range since I  have ADHD and OCD so they contribute a lot to my mood swings, but mostly it's not that intense and not changing from one extreme to the other... Except for random times. Like e.g. one day I could wake up and feel extremely suicidal out of nowhere. I could have had a good or just normal day before and all of the sudden I wake up feeling like the most worthless piece of sh*t in the whole world. I look in the mirror and cry because I feel so ugly. I start thinking about every moment in my life where I did the slightest thing wrong and beat myself up for it. I start getting insanely mad and just feel sooo aggresively hateful towards everyone because I think that I'm the only unlucky person out there. I get filled with jealousy. Everyone is more attractive, smarter and just way more likeable than me. It's just hours of self pity, hate and anger. I get this intense uncomfortable feeling that I want to crawl out of my body because I can't bear being me. It's so unbearable, I then go on trying to look for suicide methods. Like I get really serious about it and prepare everything. I decide that this time I'll just do it and stick with it. But then usually the next day (or at most after four days of this ""manic"" episode), I wake up and feel the complete opposite. It's like I'm on drugs. I become so optimistic and motivated to change my life around. I plan out all those things I wanna do, how productive I wanna become and just feel like I'm on top of the world. I also become so grateful for everything I have and start feeling so much empathy and want to hug everyone. This happiness phase doesn't last long tho, only a few hours. After that I come back to my usual daily mood swings. Here it's also about the same kinda themes. I go from self-pity and self-hate to confident and optimistic but it's FAR FAR less intense and with much ""smoother"" transitions between those moods. 
But regarding my extreme type of episodes, it also works the other way around where I get sudden dopamine rushes first and after that I get into that rabbit hole again. 
I don't think I'm bipolar since this whole cycle lasts only a few days at most (it could even be all in one day or just a few hours). Also it happens at random times. I could go months feeling ""normal"" and then it just happens once or it could happen multiple times in a month. So what could this be? Does anyone else have this?",General_disorder

"Mental illness runs in my family but my mother has never officially been diagnosed. Iâ€™m not sure what sheâ€™s struggling with because it doesnâ€™t align with any other typical mental illness and she refuses to seek help. My mom has lied about so many things Iâ€™ve lost count, but she doesnâ€™t see them as lies. She genuinely thinks itâ€™s the truth. I used to think she was lying and trying be manipulative until I realized how real it is to her. For example she used to tell me awful stories about my father that I believed until I finally got old enough to realize they werenâ€™t true and logically didnâ€™t add up. Now itâ€™s to the point where some things she believes are so outlandish that thereâ€™s no doubt her thinking is in delusional territory. Now she thinks her ex husband is spying on her, lives in her neighborhood, and is hiring people to damage her house. She also thinks her husband is cheating on her when he goes to work or even a gas station with no proof whatsoever. She thinks the church she used to go to is out to get her, theyâ€™re stalking her, theyâ€™re plotting to sabotage her relationships and everything they say and do is directed towards her (even though itâ€™s been over a year since sheâ€™s been).  She thinks they are still talking about her and plotting to ruin her life right now. She sees people walking in the neighborhood and thinks theyâ€™re being malicious and trying to spy or sabotage her relationship with her husband. Everything in life has an alternate meaning to my mom, and everyone has a secret malicious motive, even cashiers at grocery stores. Sheâ€™s  fixated on this, and has a hard time ever changing the subject. This is exhausting for me because Iâ€™m all she has. She has no friends or family because she is so paranoid everyoneâ€™s out to get her. She used to tell me my friends were plotting to kill me and I could tell she genuinely believed it. If I go against any of these delusions Iâ€™m now part of the problem and she starts getting angry with me so the only option I have left is try to deescalate the situation. She just called and talked to me for two hours in a delusional rage. I hate not believing her because I love her and I feel guilty for even doubting her (for a long time I believed everything) but I know itâ€™s a lie because when I ask her to elaborate on certain things she canâ€™t and her argument begins to fall apart/not make any sense.

Part of me thinks that it isnâ€™t an excuse for someone with a mental illness to treat others like shit, but I guess I think if it is because of bipolar it would allow me to understand.

Idk. I'm just scared. My depression is the worst it's ever been.

My question is why do we as a society cater so much to Gender Dysphoria?

Iâ€™m not asking this is a rude way, but as a genuine question. (And no, Iâ€™m not Christian. Yes, half of my best friends are apart of the LGBTQIA+ society, and Iâ€™m a firm believer in living your life the way you want to as long as youâ€™re not hurting anyone.)

I just genuinely want to know why I, as a straight woman, should feel so pressured into putting down my pronouns in general, but when Iâ€™m obviously a woman? I personally feel like we as a society are catering to a mental illness instead of helping people by getting to the bottom of why they disassociate from their gender and why they feel so uncomfortable in their own skin that they undergo dangerous and invasive surgeries.

Now, nobody is any less of a person for having Gender Dysphoria, you canâ€™t help it and it has 0% reflection on who you are as a person. But why is this the only mental disorder that we as a society are REALLY pushing to cater to? 

Scientifically, there are only two genders because there are only XX and XY chromosomes. Why is it that we as a society have normalized someone choosing to be non-binary (according to science, you literally canâ€™t be non-binary. Itâ€™s not physically possible.), but if someone has Dissociative Identity Disorder, we as a society donâ€™t play into their mental health issues by addressing them by their 20 different identities throughout the course of the day? All we say is that they need help. 

I really donâ€™t understand this societal mentality and I feel like people have lost sight of common sense in the name of progression that isnâ€™t really progression if youâ€™re not actually helping anyone with their mental health. 

I feel like all weâ€™re doing as a society is trying to push the idea of enabling mental health issues into becoming severe because all weâ€™re telling people with Gender Dysphoria is to be themselves. But if theyâ€™re born a man, but theyâ€™re identifying as a woman, how are they being themselves? Shouldnâ€™t we as a society help them by getting to the bottom of why theyâ€™re feeling this way? I mean, thatâ€™s what we do if someone has body dysmorphia.

I canâ€™t feel happy and I canâ€™t feel sad. Nothing really bothers me like it used to. It feels like my emotional sensations have been turned off, but to outsiders I probably look like Iâ€™m functioning normally. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m just going through the motions. Surviving, not living. Colors arenâ€™t bright or vivid. Even my sense of smell is weaker than it used to be. It feels like Iâ€™m in a constant fog or almost like a veil is covering my awareness. Could I be too pre-occupied with my thoughts to allow my emotional sensations to function properly in response to my surroundings, due to lack of awareness? Everything feels cold and robotic. Iâ€™ve had social anxiety since my parents divorce when I was a child. My mother said that I used to be an outgoing, happy kid but after the separation I went into a shell and was very quiet and shy which I still am to this day. I would and still do avoid groups and I try to hide when in one. Public speaking terrifies me to the point of trembling. Iâ€™ve had anxiety and panic attacks ever since my father passed away of cancer when I was 18. I was in denial when he was sick, assuming he would be fine. Him dying was never an option in my mind so I treated him the same as I did prior to his diagnosis, if not worse. I also did this with my grandmother when she developed dementia, I slowly distanced myself to avoid the impact of her loss. Itâ€™s like I have no regard for others feelings. I do whatever I need to do to protect my own feelings and I feel so guilty for it. My dad and I were inseparable and I loved him more than anyone in my life (my grandmother wouldâ€™ve been second). If I had to lose anyone he wouldâ€™ve been the last one Iâ€™d choose to go and he ended up being the first significant loss Iâ€™ve ever experienced, right on the cusp of adulthood. I just recently found out a month ago that he wasnâ€™t my biological father and that my biological father had passed away just a few years ago. I donâ€™t know who I am, I feel like a stranger in my own body and I canâ€™t comprehend it. It feels like my life is a movie or a game. I also donâ€™t feel my age, like Iâ€™m in arrested development or something. I donâ€™t feel like I know how to be an adult so Iâ€™ll act how I picture an adult is supposed to act but itâ€™s very unnatural and embarrassing in hindsight. The panic attacks arenâ€™t full blown attacks like they used to be but they still try to come on, but maybe Iâ€™m just able to shut them down easier since I know how to recognize them. Iâ€™ve had several episodes of paranoia over the last few years, thinking that subliminal messages are being given in songs or advertisements to make me think that people arenâ€™t who they appear to be but they all know the purpose of my life and like itâ€™s some kind of sick game where they know whatâ€™s going on and drop hints about it to tease me, like a big inside joke and Iâ€™m the only one who doesnâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on. Itâ€™s torture. Iâ€™ll get very depressed for months at a time and gain weight from drinking alcohol regularly and have no desire to improve my life but then Iâ€™ll wake up one day very motivated to change and feel optimistic and positive and Iâ€™ll have extreme willpower like losing 45 pounds in 5 months and doing things I never thought Iâ€™d do like taking a college class. But then Iâ€™ll start to not feel like eating healthy at all and over indulge constantly and Iâ€™ll feel like college isnâ€™t who I am and Iâ€™ll drop out of the class with no backup plan. It feels very impulsive. Iâ€™m either all in or all out. And Iâ€™m easily influenced. Iâ€™ll get big ideas about my potential and purpose that isnâ€™t rooted in reality, but it feels possible and right in my mind. Like thinking that Iâ€™m meant to do something impactful with my life like being a writer or musician but not being very good at either one in reality. Iâ€™ll feel like Iâ€™m extremely important and that everyone cares about whatâ€™s going on in my life and that they are always watching or admiring me. I feel very special for some reason even though Iâ€™m probably not of interest to anyone. Itâ€™s extremely hard to live balanced or how I envision â€œnormalâ€ or â€œregularâ€ to be. Itâ€™s hard to trust people. I feel like I donâ€™t know myself. I feel hopeless. I feel lost and confused. I have no firm ground to stand on. My mind and emotions feel like scar tissue from thinking so much over the years. Iâ€™ve been into philosophy and religion since 2012 and I over analyze everything. I believe anything that I think. Itâ€™s hard to discern between fantasy and reality. I find patterns in everything. My thoughts are endless and I constantly beat myself up over past mistakes and regrets. My mind feels overworked. Iâ€™ve had a counselor say that I couldâ€™ve taught her philosophy class in college and that everything I was saying to her made complete sense from a philosophical standpoint but other doctors saw it as a schizophrenic disorder. Am I too aware and in tune with the nature of reality or am I delusional? Iâ€™m so confused. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. Itâ€™s hard for me to feel hopeful at this point but Iâ€™ve been searching for a good counselor and psychiatrist to be able to figure out whatâ€™s wrong with me. Iâ€™ve been told itâ€™s anxiety, depression, PTSD and schizoaffective disorder over the years. If anyone can help me understand whatâ€™s going on with me Iâ€™d be very grateful. I just want to feel like I used to, as scary as it may be. By feeling again it will hurt to lose whatâ€™s important to me but right now Iâ€™m not even able to enjoy what I have. It feels like Iâ€™m in emotional limbo. Every few months Iâ€™ll have a moment where I feel extremely aware and in sync with the regular life that I used to know and my emotions flood back all at once and I feel like Iâ€™m coming back to life again. Iâ€™ll even say to myself â€œwow, Iâ€™m backâ€ but I have to fight to keep feeling it and then it goes away. Is it possible to shut off your emotions? Will it get better?",General_disorder
"This might be a bit long but Iâ€™m desperate for answers. Weâ€™ve been dating for about a month, but I had a crush on them for at least half a year. Iâ€™m very happy that we are finally dating, but I have a problem. I found that Iâ€™m completely obsessed with them, to the point that when they went on a ten-day trip far away from my home I just have this crushing feeling of loneliness. It is so bad that Iâ€™m literally considering suicide because the pain is just too much to handle. It is also the case when theyâ€™re talking to someone they like (even completely platonically) I just feel nothing but envy. I definitely am more susceptible to obsession because Iâ€™m on the Aspergerâ€™s spectrum which means my brain just functions differently than to most other people. I think that it is literally ruining my life at this point. I hate myself for this kind of feelings, I know itâ€™s also mentally strenuous for them. And I really want them to be happy.

"I never had any mental health problems at all. Suddenly one day I felt really anxious. This went on for awhile before it when into panic and exhaustion. I went to get everything checked and I was told that I was in good health. As time went on I wasn't improving much. I went for a second opinion. I got the same answers that I was in good health. 

I figured maybe this was a mental health issue rather than a physical problem. I decided to get a complete mental health assessment. They mentioned some anxiety and I shown ways to help reduce my stress levels. Then more symptoms started appearing. I was getting voices, rapid thoughts, images with my eyes closed, intrusive thoughts, repetitive thoughts, etc. The hallucinations happen when I'm trying to sleep. I went to a local ER for mental health. They really didn't offer much help and sent me home. I decided to make an appointment with a regular PCP. I asked about psychosis or schizophrenia. He said I didn't have psychosis, schizophrenia, or even a sleep disorder. I was told that I have anxiety and possibly a mild form of depression.

I looked online for some book recommendations and one that kept popping up was â€œThe Midnight Libraryâ€ by Matt Haig. I finished the book yesterday and it made me look at myself. The book discusses suicidal ideation and regret and I think it was one of the most accurate depictions of my experience with depression. I would not recommend reading this if you are in a suicidal state; however, if you are coming out of an episode or looking for something besides sleeping to keep your mind going I recommend this book a million percent. I personally have a lot of trauma and anxiety regarding the pressure I put on myself to please others and this book does an amazing job of relating to that while being interesting and entertaining.",General_disorder

"Iâ€™m so tired of everything. Everything thatâ€™s going on in the world right now, everything in my own life. No one cares about me. Not my friends, that donâ€™t reach out to me even though I go out of my way to make sure they know I care. Not my parents, that make me believe that every ounce of myself I bring into their lives and home is a burden to them. Not anyone I know. People talk all the time about how you donâ€™t need anyone else to make you happy, but those people have those in their lives that continuously show support to them, people that they can easily fall back on in times of need. Iâ€™m alone, I donâ€™t have that. Not one person cares. I wish there were no stakes, that no one existed, that I could just be at peace, whether that be dead or in my life. Everyone always talks about how thereâ€™s hope and resources available, but itâ€™s never true, itâ€™s all a lie or scam. All people want to do is profit off of othersâ€™ ill-being, they donâ€™t actually care. I feel like a pawn, people only reach out to me when they want or need me for something. Hell, I did the same once to someone else, and I still think about it and regret it. How are people so heartless, how ones everyone just put social norms over the lives of others as if itâ€™s no big deal? People rant in this subreddit because they have no one left or had no one in the first place. Is it that hard to just let someone know that you care about them, if itâ€™s the difference in saving a life or letting someone kill themself because they have no hope left?

Iâ€™m exhausted just from waking up every day knowing that I wonâ€™t have the motivation to do shit, and feeling physically exhausted from absolutely nothing. Every day I loathe seeing people and living a normal life, because I know itâ€™ll make me feel 10x worse. No one knows how badly Iâ€™m struggling, and even if they did, they wouldnâ€™t care. I grew up feeling like I couldnâ€™t express my feelings, so Iâ€™ve held in all my secrets for years. And yet, Iâ€™m the class clown, Iâ€™m the lively person that no one would expect to be writing this. I have no trouble putting on an act, because Iâ€™ve been doing it for my whole life.

"I had a traumatic childhood and Iâ€™ve dealt with pretty major depressive episodes and general anxiety my whole life. Iâ€™m 36 and Iâ€™ve made decent progress to unlearn a lot of my shitty mental habits. But one thing that I simply canâ€™t figure out how to do is, what actions do you take to feel your emotions instead of blocking them out? Iâ€™ve blocked them out my entire life with one or another bad habit but Iâ€™m trying to learn a new way to be. But what steps do you take to actually lean into the pain and process it? My default state is to feel bad and then work to avoid it. Instead Iâ€™ve been trying to just feel the bad emotion and not push it away, but then I start feeling sorry for myself. If my emotional state is unstable at that point, this can often throw me into a spiral of depression that overtakes me.

"Iâ€™ve been feeling stuck all day. I was upset about something involving my partner, but I donâ€™t even really remember exactly what it was only bits and pieces.. I do know it wasnâ€™t a big deal really, or rather itâ€™s something I need to fix within myself. 

I work from home and Iâ€™ve been sitting, waiting for footage to load on Dropbox (Iâ€™m an assistant editor) so I can actually do something. I napped today, I ate. My room is disgusting, my kitchen the same and no one except myself is expected to clean at all. I donâ€™t have a car, so I canâ€™t drive somewhere pretty or serene. I want to go to the gym, I plan on spending my last 17$ in ubering later after I finish working so I can at least do that for myself. 

 I feel stuck in this dirty room, because thereâ€™s a man who sleeps on the couch all day, never showers, creates filth in the living room. My mom works in the office in the house all day, she can barely walk from weight and sitting all day from overworking. I want to be able to make her meals more consistently, clean more consistently, but I just really donâ€™t. I try, but I never stick through. I just stop. I stop cause I get angry, that no one helps me. So I stay in my room all day every day for those reasons because of guilt and me feeling uncomfortable with him. 

Itâ€™s rarely peaceful here, they always watch very loud movies with surround sound all through the night (Iâ€™m talking AMâ€™s) and it prevents me from feeling peace. They used to fight, he used to be this horrible alcoholic and has done awful things to me and my mom. Now he just exists.thereâ€™s not really much fighting anymore.

So Iâ€™m just sitting here waiting for things to upload, feeling very unsure of what I need right now to feel good I guess. I reminisced on my life 300 weeks ago via Instagram and I looked like I was enjoying my life so much. I was prettier, enjoying my friends. I felt like I had an identity, even a cute sense of style. I also remember feeling ugly, overweight, undesirable, and not good enough. Ironic that Iâ€™m envious of who I was before even though I didnâ€™t even realize I was already who I needed to be. 

Im not even sure what I want exactly to feel, so maybe I want to know what I need to feel or should be feeling?? Idk maybe not. I have creative projects, I tried working on that today and I didnâ€™t feel the same excitement and joy as I did last week when I worked on it. Aha, maybe I want to feel joy. What do I need to feel joy? And , why does it go away so easily all the time over things I canâ€™t even really remember  anymore..But I did just remember.. Iâ€™m having a hard time accepting the obvious things that make me unhappy. They just seem so broad, thereâ€™s no clear answer to what I need. I just wish someone could tell me what I exactly need and what I exactly want to feel so I could just get it done and feel content again.

"I dated a girl and I'm trying to work out if she did in fact have a mental illness. Here are some examples of her behaviour;

- Incident #1
This one time, she was talking to the ceiling lights 
She would wave hello and goodbye to the ceiling lights
And the reason as to why she would do that, is because she believed that there were government cameras in the ceiling of our house

- Incident #2
When people would pray over her. She would scream and shout at the top of lungs. It was quite terrifying. Witnessing a grown adult scream and shout at the top of her lungs. Terrifying

- Incident #3
When people would pray over her at church. She would make weird body contortions. Kind of like, spasms. It was kinda weird. Kind of hard to explain the body movements

- Incident #4
She would very often say that she gets ""spiritually attacked"" late at night in bed and she would describe that as ""feeling like somebody is eating her brain""

- Incident #5
She couldn't quite control her anger. When she would get angry, she would go from 0 to 100 within 1x second. It was very unsettling and scary the speed and the intensity at which she would get angry

- Incident #6
She would get physically violent. This one time, we didn't have a fight, we didn't have an argument, she just came up to me and punched me in the stomach around 7times being full of rage. That was very odd. There was no incident that happened beforehand that triggered the assault

- Incident #7
She was very hard to live with. She was very irritable. A lot of the times, she seemed to be in a combative/heightened state of alert type thing. A lot of the times, she would be ready to ""explode"" type thing over the smallest of things. Like me just grabbing the wrong towel for example, she would explode over it

- Incident #8
She would go into depressive episodes quite regularly out of nowhere. Nothing would trigger it

- Incident #9
She would sometimes go into ""retreat mode"" where she would turn off her phone for a whole week and nobody would hear from her at all for a whole week. She would sometimes disappear from everyone randomly for a whole week without warning


Additional information;
- her mother said that she is not ""sane mentally""
- she tried to committ suicide in her younger years
- she went into a psych ward when she was younger too but she hides from me what the doctors actually said that she had and she didn't believe the doctors diagnosis

"I guess it's stated about a year ago. I won't be using specifics to keep this as anonymous as possible. Point is I (M18), about a year ago got close to a distant relative of mine. Her and I talked a lot for about a year and got closer than I had ever been with anyone else. My family doesn't like or care for me and I've always looked for someone who did. She ended up being that person. We told each other everything. At some point I made a choice. If people didn't care about me, I wouldn't care about them and I would stop trying to gain their love that didn't exist. I didn't need it anymore. Not when I had someone who I know cares and loves me. (Not that kind of love, but just family love, yk?) Anyways, I cared for her and worried about her and made sure she was ok. She has a very stressful family life and she felt the same way about her family how I feel about mine. She talked to me about her in her darkest moments and she pulled me out of mine. A couple of close calls. But just as soon as I gained this compassion that I've been looking for my entire life, it was all taken from me. 

I usually talk to her every day, but one day I didn't get a response. I ended up calling her sister and it turns out her phone broke. Shit happens, I'm sure she'll talk to me when she gets a new one. 2 days later I get a text from her at 1 am. Of course, I'm awake, like any normal teenager. She asks if I'm awake but the text is panicked. I say 'yes, what's wrong?' She says she had bad news. Apparently her dad, who is unreasonably strict, thinks that there's something between us. He suspects that we're ""together"" and he forbids us from ever talking to each other ever again. I had to say goodbye to her in that one instant. 

It's been 3 weeks. I know that doesn't sound like much, but it feels so much longer. I had a nightmare about her last night. I was looking into what seems like a gym, but it was being repurposed as a medical facility. I was looking in through windows on the gym doors. I could see a lot of patients on the floor with dark blue mattresses and covers. I was waiting. I knew what was gonna happen. A voice over the speaker came on and ordered everyone to stand. Everyone did, except her. I screamed out loud in a cry and grabbed my pocket knife that I always carry on me and in fluid motion it was in my throat. And I fell bleeding out. My friends around me spending time with me because they knew that I'f they move the knife, I'd die sooner. Next thing I know I'm next to her. I can see her dull eyes look back at me with nothing behind them. I talk to the doctor and he says she'll be released tomorrow. But as I'm writing this, it occurred to me. I think that was us moving onto whatever comes after life. I can still feel the knife in my throat. Keeping me from swallowing.

I've recently started forgetting. I can't remember certain aspects of stuff we've talked about or done. I look at her pictures and she doesn't look familiar. It all seems too good to be true. I don't know what really happened. It's hard to belive that I found happiness in this dark world. Now it just feels like a pleasant dream I had, in the sense that it felt so real and I'm forgetting more of it as time goes on. What if I forget completely? I don't know what to do anymore. She's the only person who cares about me and I lost her too. I have nobody to turn to. Even if I did I'd be too scared to open up, which is why I'm here. Please help.",General_disorder
