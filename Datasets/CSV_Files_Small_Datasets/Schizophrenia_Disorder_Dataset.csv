"My boyfriend got me 3 stuffed bunnies and I became deeply attached to them, when I look at them I can see various expressions on their faces telling me how they're feeling, but that isn't normal right? I don't think this is an issue except for the fact that I'm obsessed with these bunnies and want to be with them all the time.",Schizophrenia

"So I am 21 In the Navy and sometimes I wonder If I have Schizophrenis.Like recently I developed a stutter and I'm nit the best speaker, but men in my family are just know for not being the best speakers.My memory is complete trash but like its always been that way,I've has one anxiety attack where I thought people were out to get me but none ever since. Plus I was just coming off smoking Dab pens all the time so I imagined that didn't helped.People say I walk and move slow but like idk if that's true or not.I do struggle with trusting other people but I'm a black male so people trying to screw me over isn't unheard of.IDK.What do you guys think.",Schizophrenia
"Hello. I'm sorry to write on the same topic as there is, but I didn't find the answer to my question anywhere. I believe others are reading my mind. I have a lot of evidence that this is true, but I talk to a psychologist and she says it's not possible. You can think of a way to deal with this. I would like to look for evidence every day that this is not the case. Does anyone have an idea? thank you for every answer and have a nice day. :)",Schizophrenia
"I don't know anymore. I had a psychosis last year, around the same time as now. And I'm currently not on meds anymore because I did not need them. The doctors also said that I don't need them. Well, well now I'm sitting her after I was in hospital and at the doctor to check if I have any physical problems. I had none, my hearth is ok and perfect. But it still feels like someone is sitting on it. I feel pressure in it. It's not  bearable. And it won't go away. That's when I get worried, at first I thought it had something to do with BPD. Because a girl did ignore me and didn't text back, what caused me to freaked out. That's when this started, by the way. Since then, I feel like going insane. It's like I'm gone burst from the inside. It feels like I'm exploding. I had  tactile hallucinations last year during my psychosis, which was not really a true psychosis in my opinion. I had no  unchallengeable delusion. And  symptoms were flying from one side to the next. Still I got Seroquel or Quentiapin which is a hell of a drug to put someone one. And I don't want to get that shit again. Also, back then I was in the teen mental hospital which is excellent in my area, but the adult one is trash. You can't go there, you don't get therapy or treatment, all you get is drugs. And no one cares about you. It was literally like that, but it feels like I'm going insane, nothing gets better at home. It just gets worse day after day. I try to endure it the best I can, but it's not ending. I feel like I'm dying before I hit new year... You know, I'm born 2002 and my birthdate has a lot of 2s in it. That's why I will 100% die 2022. I only have 2 more days and life gives me psychosis or hallucinations for me to die. I know this cant be true, but I still feel like it's true. I can't control it and push my feelings back anymore. It's like life is a hell. I don't want to have Schizophrenia. I will never be able to fulfill my dreams I get put on drugs no one listens to me and I sleep the hole day. All my creative energy will be gone because of some shit diagnosis I did not choose to have. Meanwhile, I'm still getting emotionally abused at home and no one loves me at all. I had visual hallucinations yesterday, but they went away today. I'm domed and going to die soon it's unlucky and even if I will not die how is this liveable when I have schizophrenia. I needed to  repeat this last year of school before college because of the psychosis and PTSD already once, I can't do it again. I will not be happy ever. If I don't complete this year, my mom will continue the abuse and I can never escape my faith. I really want to die, but at the same time I don't, because if I just got treated right this wouldn't have happened to me. What should I do in your opinion? Please help me? :\^(",Schizophrenia
"Hey guys. As you've noticed, we're being hit with a lot of trolls. And we know they're abusing you guys. We're trying our best to keep up but it's taking constant monitoring and we're not getting enough reports to catch everything so we have to monitor the entire sub constantly. So we want to know, do you want to go private, do you want to stay public and keep dealing with these garbage trolls, or do you want everything to have to be mod approved? Let us know! We'll give this a few hours!

"Hey guys, my mother is diagnosed with schizophrenia since I was little. We were giving her medications but she secretly threw them in the trashcan, worsening her condition.

The psychiatrist thought an idea, we give her medications secretly with her coffee everyday. This has been going on for 8 years though.

The thing is, if someone forgets it, she relapses and we start from 0. I want to tell her with a different way that she is ill, so she can get help and maybe start getting the meds herself. It is very difficult for my family and they start to lose their patience. Noone takes responsibility and that breaks my heart. How can I tell her?",Schizophrenia
I am unable to handle my dreams anymore. They are so intense and I wake up every morning not sure If it happened or not. I think this plays a part of how I am in the mornings. I'm very manic in the mornings and will just start cleaning till exhaustion. I guess it gives me a sense of control idk. I woke up this morning and I was like wth I thought I shaved my legs. It was a dream. I also have one specific person that reoccurs in EVERY dream. It's quiet emotional and exhausting. Can anyone relate? I have been diagnosed schizophrenic for 2 years. Tell me it gets better.,Schizophrenia

"Hey everyone. I'm struggling. There is a lot of pressure on me. My husband works but he is sick with bronchitis. So despite my physical disabilities I have been doing all the chores around the house by myself including with dealing with repair people coming in, running errands with my mother, doing the grocery shopping, getting my husband to the doctor, cooking all my husband's meals, unpacking still, getting insurance in a new state, finding doctors, PCPs and Mental Health specialists etc etc... but the last 3 days I've been without my antipsychotic because my husband has been too sick to go to the pharmacy and my mother didn't need to go there so wouldn't take me and I don't really drive. 

I've felt like people are coming to kill me. The voices in my head that watch me are getting louder and louder. My husband is verbally abusing me. I normally would make excuses for him but I don't feel like it anymore. He's been cruel. And I have to keep it together. And it's so hard. I've been sneaking out into the backyard to cry. I just have to hold it together a little longer until I get my medication later today.",Schizophrenia
"Well, slap me silly. I have managed to tick off a 25 person â€œSunday Schoolâ€ by leaving their cancerous app, which none of the teachers ever check up on. And the entire class is ******* ******off at me because it's my fault because my â€œpsychiatristâ€ cut me off my meds and I am just a little bloody irritated at everything. I get it, I need to grab those reigns a little, and it's going to take months to find a doctor who accepts my insurance. ACT LIKE CHRISTIANS AND GIVE ME JUST THE TINIEST BIT OF SLACK. Instead of the whole just saying â€œWhoah then, I am sorry. I'll pray for you insteadâ€. I hate everyone but one person in this church",Schizophrenia

"I've been hearing things all day long for years now. I can't remember a day where I went at least 10 minutes without hearing a voice.. At times they suggest I commit suicide but I've never tried to act on it nor do I want to. I've been to the psych unit many times in the past few years, but it rarely helps. If anything, it makes the voices weirder. 

This morning I had another panic attack from the voices. This one was short and only lasted an hour or two. I have been able to calm myself down and am starting to feel better, but going back to the past h unit did cross my mind. 

If you've ever been to the psych unit, what was the reasoning? Were you suicidal, homicidal, or depressed?",Schizophrenia

"I think I cracked what reality is. I've had schizophrenia for two years but it got especially bad after some long term drug use that I'm still working on. (Just weed, and Kratom from time to time.) But in two mind bending trips on psychedelics I discovered the universe is a infinitely repeating simulation. It's all also a pattern of infinite fractals. I seem to have memories of living my exact life millions of times before, that I'm all I will ever be forever. That some God or Creator made. That I'm just one consciousness and all of you are part of me and I'm all of you. If that makes sense. Ever since that and much more happened on those trips I can feel reality as a construct of fractals that infinitely repeats itself. Knowing we are all the same in our deepest self, I've been trying to add and find the answer as to why I'm here in this simulation. For what purpose are I being forced to live the same lives over and over again? Recently I was hit by deja vu and realized that perhaps that's me being able to subconsciously remember my previous toils in this body.

I didn't have any real optimism or expectation for 2022 but it'd be nice to take a day off from the paranoia to get a Korean style shaved ice with azuki beans and coffee ice cream, visit a book fair, etc. I was imagining how bleak next year will be with my friend leaving and my own life not improving.

Hey guys :)
Hope my post is allowed here, if you wanna remove it that's okay too.
My sibling (23, non-binary, amab) is on promethazine, lexapro and 5mg resperidone for over a year now. In July 2020 they told me their psychologist is expecting they will develop schizophrenia in the future. Shortly afterwards they got hospitalized for 3months to be stabilized.
Right now the meds won't stop them experiencing positive or negative symptoms. They told me they are about to get diagnosed with schizophrenia.

I already talked with my own psychologist about that and I feel so helpless when I try to help them or myself in this situation:
First of all I wanna validate them when it comes to their gender identity. But they getting are more and more detached from reality, their personality is changing and I also don't wanna confirm their delusions or encourage them to permanently change their body. I know they first told me about their dysphoria in their teens, but right now, it feels like a rock and a hard place in how i talk with them about that topic. And if  they are right about their gender identity i am scared nobody will take them seriously with that in the future.

Also they talk with me without the ability to emphasize with my own situation: they are telling me about their suicide ideation, the weird stuff they find on the internet and confront me with some stuff my PTSD-brain finds really triggering. I already told them that with my past it's hard to digest what they are telling me. But they won't stop and i am getting mad at them.

I wanna help them and I don't want them to further isolate themselves from me and my parents, but sometimes they really hurt my feelings and as I said I feel like I can't help them. I already asked them if they wanna be in hospitalized care again but they won't budge.
Also: they don't keep away from drugs which is concerning.

How can I help? I really don't wanna lose them.

"I have been meaning to make a post for a while but today has been so hard on me I finally felt the need to reach out for some support.  My psych that diagnosed me recently left and transferred me to a new one who I hadn't met before.  Today was my first appointment with her and it went exactly as poorly as I feared.  She asked me to explain my symptoms, so I told her kind of my story about falling into psychosis last may and having trouble getting out.  

I told her that I am currently struggling with visual and olfactory hallucinations, and that in the past had also dealt with some auditory hallucinations, delusions, and pretty all consuming paranoia.  I only had thirty minutes with her to explain my struggles and after that thirty minutes she told me that my symptoms don't line up with Schizophrenia which really confused me.  She said that if I wasn't dealing with primarily auditory hallucinations then odds are it is a neurological issue other than schizophrenia.  

On top of that, she told me that I should have undergone a psych eval before transitioning and continued to refer to me as ""transgendered"" and dealing with ""transgenderism"" which is super outdated and a big red flag in the trans community.

All in all, I got thirty minutes to try and explain my situation and got nowhere other than being told I needed to undergo neurological examination and that I probably wasn't schizophrenic.  In her mind, im not schizophrenic because I don't have literal voices berating me all day or extreme paranoia literally every day.  She took away the one thing that to me explained why ive been struggling so much over the last year after just 30 minutes of talking to me.

I feel really unstable right now because of all this.  Im questioning myself and who I am and whether any of this last year has been real at all.  Im really upset and spent the last 2 hours just crying reevaluating my life.  Idk if I need to find a new psych or if im really just not schizophrenic and its all been in my head this whole time.

And today after millions of coincidences which some of them were really hard to deal because they had so little chance to happen but when it comes to ocd they are actually happen, i experienced once again. When im reading,  a thought came to mind that if in the next page you see x number that means y will happen. y is an intrusive thought im scaring so much even here i can't talk about that. Then i looked at next page i was reading so quickly hoping will not see that number and suddenly i saw that x number the only number in that page. I was shocked.

 I didn't see things I just heard voices in my head the whole time .
I didn't seek medical help , or said -at the time - anything to anyone . As time went on , I took myself out of it by saying to myself that none of this are real . With time the voices were ""quieter""  and in around 2 years stopped all together. 
 It's been 5 years now and it's gone , never came back !

"Every time I find someone nice, after a while they say suspicious things, which leads me to believe that they are trying to lure me into a trap. I no longer fall for these traps, having my mind read out by secretly broadcast electronic waves, cell phone signals, and the like.

I always think they are nice because they say nice words and say they understand me and want to be there for me, but after a few days I realize the real mission of these manipulative creatures hidden within a human body. And most of the time I'm not even sure if they have taken human form because I can't see them through my phone screen. They probably aren't even hiding anymore. 


One day I stood in front of the mirror and my eyes lit up and I saw that there was an entity in my eyes, trying to steal my thoughts for experimental purposes.

One is a major spike in anxiety, and the other is that I get sensory overload *waaaay* easier.

"Hello! Thank you to everyone who participated in my PhD research study posted a few months ago - we are excited to see how we can use these results to further our understanding of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. I am just posting the study details one last time before we finish recruitment. See below if interested in participating.

Have you ever been diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder? The team at Swinburne University are looking for participants to take part in an online research project investigating unusual bodily experiences and beliefs in individuals with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. To be eligible, participants will also be *over the age of 18, fluent in the English language, and have NO HISTORY of an eating disorder, neurological disorder (e.g. migraine, epilepsy) or traumatic brain injury*. The survey should take approximately half an hour and is entirely anonymous.

I have voices I hear already, it seems to sound like nothing but a voice in the distance now. Yet I noticed the same voice would come from different directions. I believe these voices are actual people and I believe they are putting themselves in my perspective. I think voodoo might be involved with my condition. I question why and how the voice moves from my surroundings and how the voice can put a thought in my head. I have only been told by one man about it. A stranger came up to me and told me he had the ability to see in other people's eyes and could see through mine. Seems too farfetched to be really talking about me and hes not the only one.

"Constant battle. Everything needs to be done.  I don't know what to do, don't know for years now.

I know I am gonna get psychotic as fuck. I'm gonna feel really miserable. But I don't care no more. Fuck life.",Schizophrenia
"I know, it's petty. And this is just gonna be mindless ranting and me getting things off my chest.

But when I was 17, I started hearing voices and seeing things, and a year later I was diagnosed with type undifferentiated schizophrenia. And you know who was there for me? Fuckin nobody. My parents were so scared of my diagnosis they tried to pretend it never happened. I tried to tell some of my closest friends about it in confidence, one of them claimed schizophrenia ""wasn't real"" and another claimed I was just ""making it up for attention and pity."" I maintain to this day that if I wanted attention and pity I'd, you know, actually tell people about it, but I digress. Doctors were awful, teachers were awful, everybody in my church who I was taught to rely on growing up turned away from me, and I had to teach myself to manage my schizophrenia on my own.

I'm one of the lucky ones who only has their illness go for four and a half or so years before it dissipates. I got rediagnosed with schizoaffective depressive disorder. Fast forward about eight years and now I'm a nurse, I treat mentally ill patients here and there, and very soon may start working professionally treating schizophrenic, bipolar, and other acutely mentally ill patients full time. But I think I'll start working on a more critical medical floor first; one day someone might have a heart attack or go into shock in front of me, and I want to be able to respond confidently to that situation. So for the time being I'm trying to either get to an ICU or a stepdown unit.

But you know what I see every day? People treating their mentally ill patients like trash. Even though they've been specifically trained on treating psych patients, they still respond in the stupidest fucking ways! Three or four months ago a schizophrenic patient was on our floor, and he had ""Facial twitches."" I never met the guy but one of my fellow nurses went in there to treat him, came back to the station, and started bad mouthing him. ""I mean, just looking at him, his face just... twitches like that. I mean, I don't know how I could just, you know, be friends, with someone like... that."" Facial twitches! It was probably tardive you fucking moron, and even if it wasn't, what did it matter if their face twitched or not?? Years of fighting stigma have trained me in how to hold my tongue, but I had to really resist the urge not to go off on her for being a fuckin moron right then and there.

And I'm surrounded every day by people who think the pandemic is traumatizing. Really? This is all it takes to traumatize you? A pandemic tells you to wear a mask and be careful of transmitting your illness? You don't like the idea that every day you might suddenly be crippled, perhaps permanently, by a virus in the air that other people won't give a shit about you for? Yeah? Somebody who isn't immune to an illness won't do anything to help you if or when you get the illness even though it could easily cripple both of you between your health and finances bothers you? Yeah? At least you still have a brain that works and a fuckin job. At least people don't think you're a fucking serial killer just because you went outside today.

Fuck I hate stigma and ignorance. I hate knowing that my experience surviving schizophrenia made me into the kind of person who can shrug off working as a nurse in the pandemic like its another fucking hassle. I hate knowing how many people who say ""we should all work together to help each other!"" are all talk. I hate knowing how many people have given up on schizophrenics right out of the gate and just prefer to pretend you're not real, and if you are, you're not savable, and if you are, it's too much effort, and if it isn't, it's not something they can feasibly do, and if it is, no it isn't.

I fantasize a lot about starting a fund. Like, an investment fund. Something where fifty years from now it generates enough money to subsidize taking care of people who suffer from psychosis, and proves that for every dollar spent treating people with psychosis the local community makes three dollars back, or some arbitrary number that says ""wow, taking care of disabled people is profitable!"" If I knew more about investing and managing investment funds, I'd do it. Maybe if I can find a way to make enough money I'll open something through vanguard this year. But for the time being all I can do is hate people for giving up on me when I needed them and then being weak enough to be broken by something like this.

"The student art exhibit is opening this month and the advertisement featured a drawing of a woman on a chess board with water dripping from her hands under an orange sky. My friend is still trying to sell me on therapy and day treatment. I did the program in 2019 up until the Fall when I went to China to see relatives, then started aftercare when I got back. But then I relapsed and got kicked out but for some reason that episode felt a bit magical instead of stressful and I thought the game I played on the bus had meaning, the videos I saw had meaning, and shows like snl and pictures on tumblr all had meaning.

"So I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia about a year ago, and I had my first proper (analogue) shroom experience last night (I've had shroom pills before but never actual shrooms). Took about 2.5g and even with the aripiprazole (ablify) in my system, I had a pretty decent (if ever so slightly subdued) trip. At one point it was like the entire room was bathed in heavenly light.

Anyway, Ive been struggling with what I presume to be the negative symptoms of schizophrenia a lot recently (huge lack of motivation, socially withdrawn, inertia etc), but when I woke up this morning I felt like a new person. My place has been a bit of a sty recently and I've been hating myself for it because I've found it completely impossible to do any substantial cleaning or tidying, but as soon as I woke up I felt energised and ready to get the job done - I've now blitzed my home and it's almost completely clean and tidy - its a revelation! I didn't have any new insights or anything like that during the trip itself, but now it feels like a veil has been lifted and I can take on the world again. I'm beyond thankful for this new opportunity and breath of fresh air into my life and just wanted to share my experiences - partly because there's so much stigma around the use of psychedelics for people diagnosed with schizophrenia.

These days I often don't get much done and it'd be really nice to make progress on my recovery. Seems like everything costs more and today I spent $150 on clothes from the sales rack.

"I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type in 2016 at the age of 19 (I'm 25 now) after being hospitalized for the first time.

I was still a senior in high school when I had my first major psychotic episode at age 18, roughly four months after suffering from a bad concussion while playing in a varsity football game. No one around me knew what was wrong with me when I first started having symptoms. 

I graduated, went to a fairly challenging college for a semester, then got lower back surgery for another injury I received while playing football in high school that I never fully addressed. 

Not long after the surgery, the psychosis became very intense. My delusions ultimately led me to get on a plane to Los Angeles where I basically just chilled on the streets with homeless people for a week or two. A family friend was miraculously able to locate me and bring me back home to my parents, where I was immediately hospitalized and diagnosed.

I spent the next few years going in and out of psychosis, mania, and depression, until things got so bad that I had to enter a long-term in-patient treatment facility in Colorado in 2018. This was a huge turning point for me, ultimately setting me on the track toward making a strong recovery.

If a doctor could go into an afflicted person's head and hear all the torture we have to go through, maybe they would actually begin to understand our struggle. That would be less wrong than calling us psychotic and proceeding to prescribe us medication that only treats the symptoms(not the disease itself) and leaves us with a shortened lifespan and often unbearable side effects.

Think your parents want to string their cat up by a noose becase they don't talk about it's well being after you asked 1 minute later, while realistically they are writing an email for some church project.

Henry is William Afton's business partner and designs the animatronics for Afton Robotics. The animatronics can do many kid-friendly things, but as Baby tells us in Sister Location, her code is also programmed to count the children in the room, and when there is only one child in the room, she is coded to lure them in with ice cream and kill them by pulling them into her abdomen. She has plenty of room to do this, as she is 7'2â€.


Fredbear's Family Diner. Fredbear's Family Diner opens at some point before 1983.


Chica's Party World. Chica's party world opens after Fredbear's Family diner.


Afton Robotics rents animatronics out to other locations. Hidden in the source code of Scott Cawthon's website was a schedule for when Baby, Ballora, Funtime Freddy and Funtime Foxy would be rented out for parties and events.


Afton helps out with work at Fredbear's Family Diner. Afton (Purple Guy) is seen helping an employee into a difficult to manage springlock Bonnie suit in the spare room at Fredbear's Family Diner in a FNAF 4 minigame, presumably because he is familiar with the mechanisms, since he is the owner of the company that manufactures them.


The Bite of â€˜83 and Five Nights at Freddy's 4. The bite of â€˜83 was caused by bullying, not by violent animatronics. The child that was bitten was shoved in by his older brother and his friends and got â€œbitâ€ by Fredbear. The child was hospitalized and eventually died of his injuries.


Baby was rented to Chica's Party World. Hidden in the source code of Scott Cawthon's website were lines of code that can be read as â€œClient Directory: Chica's Party World, private birthday booking (5 or less) children, service log: Afton Robotics. This is the birthday party Baby was talking about in Sister Location where there were five children, and it is also the birthday party shown in Chica's Five Nights at Freddy's 3 mini game, where she is at a birthday party of 5 kids, all of whom die, presumably because of Baby.


Afton's daughter dies. Afton may have known about Henry's violent coding, or at least had suspicions, because he didn't allow his daughter to play with Baby while still allowing her to be rented out. Afton's daughter was at a birthday party where Baby had been rented to, and she went to play with Baby alone against her father's wishes. Baby killed her.


Baby was put out of order, and Afton Robotics shuts down. After this, Baby was locked in the Afton Robotics lab underground (the location of Sister Location). Baby says in game that she never went to another birthday party after that. Afton Robotics gets shut down as a company due to the unsafe animatronics.


Sister Location. The events of Sister Location take place some time after Baby was put out of order and after Afton Robotics closes, though the exact amount of time after isn't specified. You play as Afton, who is there to retrieve the body of his daughter from Baby's abdomen (speculation, no proof). All of the animatronics are scooped before night 4, and between night 4 and 5, Ennard puts themself together from the mass of endoskeletons left over from the scooping room. They speak through Baby's voicebox, which you had saved. When â€œBabyâ€ says Ballora is following you, and that she doesn't trust you, and then tells Ballora that you're here to help, â€œBabyâ€ is really just convincing Ballora to go along with the plan. Ballora wasn't the physical thing following you--it was Ennard. However, it was Ballora's part of the shared consciousness that was making them follow you. When Following Ennard's instructions, you end up getting scooped and Ennard uses Afton's skin as a suit, so he can walk around and escape.


Purple Guy. Though Afton is previously shown as the Purple Guy, he was still human while working at Fredbear's Family Diner. The â€œEnnard in Afton's Skinâ€ Purple Guy begins after Sister Location.


The next five murders, at Fazbear's Family Diner. In the book, Afton was described as a plump man, who then suddenly gets much thinner, his skin gets saggy, and he moves inhumanly. This is because Ennard takes over, and when Afton becomes the Purple Guy. Ennard still has the code that Henry had programmed into them, the violent urge to kill. They use their new disguise to carry out these murders, using the Spring Bonnie and Fredbear suits to lure children to their death, leading to the closing of Fredbear's Family Diner. The children died within a month. Purple guy gets crushed in a Spring Bonnie suit due to damp conditions and Ennard is mostly crushed, and locked inside the private employee's only room that was then off limit. This is the end of the Purple Guy.


This is just my opinion, but I believe that the ghosts of the children that forced Purple Guy into the suit weren't actually there, but instead symbolized Baby's regret over killing the children, since she said in Sister Location that she didn't want to nor had control over her killing the children. I believe it was self sabotage/suicide.


Fredbear's Family Diner and Chica's Party World close. The notoriety caused by the disappearances caused the Fazbear brand to lose popularity and eventually to close their doors.


Five Nights at Freddy's 2. Now 1987, a new Fazbear restaurant has opened: Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. On high alert because of the history of the brand, Fazbear Entertainment buys new animatronics, with facial recognition software. However, there are some malfunctions and they tend to be violent and search for you during the course of your shift. There is no murderer behind the animatronics' behavior in the beginning, just the animatronics malfunctioning.


Another Child Dies. Somebody snuck into the Spring Bonnie or Fredbear suit once again and killed a child, this time, a daytime worker. However, they are unconnected to the Purple Guy. The murderer messed with the animatronics, possibly to keep them on alert in case of a witness.


The bite of â€˜87. On your final night in FNAF 2, the phone guy explains that a child was murdered because a day guard used one of the yellow suits. However, there was still a birthday party scheduled the next day. Phone Guy tells you to make sure that none of the animatronics hurt anyone during the party, since they've been acting weird. Though unconfirmed, it is most likely that the bite of â€˜87 happened during this birthday party.


Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria closes. Due to the murder of yet another child, Freddy Fazbear closes its doors once again.


Another Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria opens. Some time later, another Freddy Fazbear's Pizza opens with newly designed animatronics, fuzzy, kid friendly animatronics.


Five Nights at Freddy's 1. Fazbear Entertainment tries one last time to keep the franchise alive. 20 years later, you're hired and nothing has gone wrong, no murders or anything. The reason why the animatronics attack you is because they are not allowed to be seen without a suit on, as just a bare endoskeleton. They assume that you are a bare endoskeleton, as well as phone guy, and he dies on the 4th night.


The last Freddy Fazbear's Pizza closes. The animatronics killing phone guy was the final straw, and Fazbear Entertainment was never able to recover. There were no more Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria's after phone guy's death.


Five Nights at Freddy's 3. You play as a guard at Fazbear's Fright, the horror attraction based on the events tied to Fazbear Entertainment. None of the phantom animatronics are real, they're just hallucinations from the gas. However, Springtrap is introduced. Except, Springtrap isn't new--It's Ennard. Ennard/Springtrap was found in the hidden, closed off room years later by phone dude. Since Ennard is the endoskeleton inside Spring Bonnie, Springtrap is the only real, moving animatronic in the game. Springtrap always has that leaning, decayed look because not only are they at least 25 years old, but they had also been partially crushed by the springlocks, thus, Ennard is â€œSpringtrappedâ€. They probably want to kill you because you (even though it wasn't really you) had trapped them for so many years, just like how they were trapped in the lab before. Eventually, the

"I'm starting to feel like my friends with mental illness sometimes have a subjective view that people with a bigger heart are more deserving of empathy and good fortune. They show no empathy with me when my heart doesn't melt for someone who has the heart of an angel. Tbh, I havenâ€˜t really formed an opinion and need more information. I feel like whether someone is a good person is extremely subjective depending on the situation they're put in. Some people have done more vs others feel more. I personally value having good moral standards but I don't expect other people to necessarily do the same. Not everyone values the same thing and it doesn't make you a bad person. Some people start off on the dark side but life events made them switch sides. I don't feel that someone is wrong if they don't value a person's heart and they're not necessarily bad people. I usually am nice but there are many nice people who don't want to be my friend and that's fine. My personal choice is to value having a good heart but I value many other things as well and the reality is that many people who've done wrong things shouldn't be automatically condemned. Most people have both a good side and a bad side. Maybe it's just me but I feel like there is a spiritual element to this. When someone tells me they have a heart of gold, but I don't see anything tangible, I don't want to form an opinion. I also feel that things you were born with or have lived through are important as well. I don't agree that we should live in a world where we are rewarded or punished based entirely on how nice of a person we are. I feel like this is obvious but I get delusions that people want me to turn them into billionaires in their next life in exchange for having a big heart. Idk, sometimes I need to get a feel for the situation which I don't have right now. But I don't need friends who turn their backs on me and I feel like I didn't choose to be a good person because I expected to get anything out of it. Idk, I feel like some people grow entitled when they feel morally superior to others. I really can't imagine what the world beyond the human world can be like and I seem to have artificial feelings sometimes but I don't want to live in a world where everyone who's deemed â€œgoodâ€œ goes to an exclusive club in Heaven where everyone there is equal in every way. It definitely is possible if someone's made up their mind about somethingâ€¦ but it isn't safe to follow me and I am not in a position where I want to personally offer anything to anyone. It feels like some people want me to be a leader but I live in this small human world and can't see very far. But even if I could, I feel like I don't want to get in exchange some sympathy gift like a heartfelt baked cake made with love or something. One way or the other, I'm sort of not in much contact with the spirit world right now. I'm really stuck in the dark and all I know is that things are going on that are much bigger than me. I am stuck in this box where not even Heaven or Hell feel real. But I'm open to other opinions if they can show me a bigger perspective than the one I have right now.",Schizophrenia

I need to talk to someone if I it gets worse and I end up hurting people I love by being mentally ill and a burden.

Here the thing,

If anything I've really excelled at becoming a functioning adult thanks to a friend who basically took it upon himself to be a live in therapist for a year as a studying psychotherapist. After all that's what a best friend is, mine just is pursuing a career in helping people.

I don't think either of us understood at the time, but he was a teaching me how to cope with my specific symptoms. I always thought I was just becoming a more well rounded person.


I'm worried though that one day it'll over power me, so I guess my question is what can I expect? What were your experiences? How were your symptoms from 19 y/o compared to now?

Most my symptoms got was an â€œear wormâ€ type twitch saying don't trust the government as a freshman in high school in the height of puberty and thinking I was special with powers as a real real young kid.

"A childhood friend (27/M) of mine is having a rough time right now. I started to notice that something was off when he talked about how he believed that people were poisoning him.

Eventually he moved out and bounced from one living situation to the next (would rent a room in a shared house). He's running into the same issue where he thinks his roommates are poisoning him so he keeps a mini fridge in his locked room. From time to time he thinks they pick the lock and poison his stuff. He's also having issues keeping a job. I'm afraid he'll lose his current job, he was telling me how her thinks his boss put poison in the soap and he absorbed the drugs through his pours.

I don't know how to go about helping him. I try telling him to do research on schizophrenia and that he needs to seek help but He's afraid of doctors. and I even offered to take a trip out there so that we can see a good doctor but he refuses.

"I am in my 30s and see a therapist for a while. Since my 20s it has become even more striking to me that my youth wasnt like others of 'healthier' families. It's not schizophrenia per se but the stigma around it, and the fact my mother was so sick but my father unable to bring a well needed balance. 

My mother was schizophrenic (as far as I know it started in her thirties so when i was born) and my father not, but I still think he was not stable enough to cope with the absence of my mother and her sickness and help me, truly and deeply as the only child they had. I think by now that my father has always been psychologically a bit unstable, even in a completely different extent than my mom.

Among not informing himself about the sickness of my mom he also did not really talk to me about my mother's suffering. But rather as I see it he chose to stay uninformed himself, and divorce rapidly. 

I grew up, ashamed, hiding, struggling to be myself, show up for myself, make friends. My parents did not really have friends either.

\-my mother has been sleeping a lot, from early on, medication having her very tired

\- I developed rapidly anxiety, tremors, unable to feel relax with others outside home

\- I could not really invite friends, I found my home to be messy and untidy to much extent. None of my parents could keep a nice home. I was the one as a child wanting to clean the kitchen and remove the mess, but I felt completely helpless. My father was not there to help my mom. I think she was the cleanest, until her sickness took over. My father even when living on his own always had it messy..

\-As a result I could not really relate to other children, and also in my adulthood in dating etc I always felt a difference ""will they see that I can not keep up with cleaning my flat every week?"" that I do not necessarily brush my teeth after every meal. That improved with age, of course, but I still see and feel the differences quite often with other people. And immediately there's a gap forming, because there's no way they can have experienced what I experienced. 

I show up to the world, clean, but if I am on my own even when much cleaner I struggle to keep the routine because I was never told to do so.

I dated people and felt miserable when they ran away from me but today realise they were not accepting in any case, and would have never accepted the way I grew up. We were too different.

This arised also in work, where I had success,because of ending up in environments where others had these healthy parents with good jobs and a good home. My mother could never work and my father barely landed short term jobs, and always complained to my mother and I, even after they divorced.

I did evolve over the last years, but these ideas are still within me. I wonder if I am the only one here, suffering from them?",Schizophrenia

I told the Lord , pls never let me think I'm you again . Or that I'm a God . I am just a mere mortal .. Aside from the neurodivergence .. my old church taught sort of like a â€œlittle Godsâ€ doctrine .. they are Pentecostal / word of faith .. and believe in the power of the words . It taught me that my words could create .. but the downside is it to the extreme .. it may make your feel like you're a God. I did witness many miracles in that church which is why I stayed long .. but then eventually discerned that the pastor was motivated by money more than anything .. which is why I left .. (he would say things like .. â€œthe Holy Spirit told me that 5 people would donate 500â€ and he also talks about luxurious living a lot .now I'm reading the Bible on my own so I won't be  deceived by false prophets again.. but anyways .. all of that to say .. now I'm healing from it ..

"Hello everyone!

I'm only 18 now but I'm more and more worried about my mental health.

But the weirdest thing happened today and I wanted to know if anybody experienced something similar 

Basically we were driving to the movies and passed a fast food restaurant, I looked outside the window and recognized burger king, I then looked at the name and Â«GRUGER KINBÂ» was written, I am sure of that

There's also times where I see shadows at the corner of my vision and they disappear when trying to focus on them, and reappear when losing focus, I also got the sensation of getting tapped on the shoulder multiple times within a week even when there was no one there.

It might and most certainly is just me overimagining things, but I also have an outrageous memory loss, having fake ones and sometimes my relatives saying I told them something even tho I was sure that I've never said that.
Paranoia is also a thing, even if that's a word too big to describe my case, but for example I always feel the urge to hide myself from my phone camera when doing things or being with people I know, and also have a feeling of intense starring and laughing about my person.

I know this is very small and it's not everything abnormal I'm perceiving either, just the things I can remember from the top of my head.

"Hello. Just had a nightmare of a week.

I don't want to get into it as I'm still paranoid something bad will happen to me if I do. I'm back on my meds now, but tldr: how do you forgive yourselves for what you've done in an episode? I have since spoken to my psychiatrist and retuned to meds I put off as I was worried they were poisoning me.

To be vague about it: I ended up believing that my boyfriend was out to get me based off of nonsensical hidden messages I assumed he had hidden in newspapers to tell me. I avoided him for a full week, terrified, ignoring his calls and texts.

When he came to my house, we had a screaming match of an argument. I accused him of wanting to kill me based on what I had seen from the newspapers and auditory hallucinations I was receiving. I had obsessively paged through every single social media he had, even the ones from years ago, to see if there was anything prophetic about it. I told him and he called me a creepy stalker.

We broke things off. I feel angry at myself for going through his social media's like that, it must have been alarming for him, and destroying a relationship i really enjoyed. I cant forgive myself for this, even if my friend tells me I need to understand it was an episode. He eventually understood what happened, but doesn't want to get back together. I agreed it was for the best, and left it there.

How do I move on from this? I feel like I'm the devil. I am fixated on what I've done and struggle to get up in the morning as I feel like an awful person. I have never done this before to him, and we were always very loving.

"I had my first relapse since being medicated last week. Once again, I feel like I've destroyed the one opportunity I think I had left to mend things with my ex. I'm feeling pretty hopeless about it.

A couple of days ago I walked into urgent care at a local mental health institution and spoke to a doctor who is an expert in psychopharmacology for schizophrenia. We went through my history of worst symptoms and they all seemed to align with me going on and off wellbutrin.

I remember the first time I tried wellbutrin, way before I was diagnosed with P/S, I started to get so paranoid and it's the reason I came off. I only went back on it because I figured that the paranoia was my schizophrenia and not the wellbutrin.

About two weeks before my episode, my dosage was heightened because I started to fall into a really bad depression and I went from 300 mg to 450 mg/day as well as being put on 100 mg of quetiapine fast release and 100 mg of slow release. My paranoia started again about 2 weeks after. I also was told to take the dosage all at one time and he told me that I should never have been told that and should be spacing out the dosage 3 times a day. He told me I need to taper it down and come off of it because he's concerned it could continue to heighten my paranoia.

I've been doing a lot of reading about wellbutrin and it seems that the side effects include psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, reckless behaviour, and all of these apply to me. Now the doctor is wondering if my symptoms are actually wellbutrin induced as he said there are cases of wellbutrin unmasking psychosis. He

"Hey guys,

I'm an amateur writer and am planning to write a book with a series of thrilling, dark stories that usually have huge plot twists. One of the stories in which I am planning to write is about a character who lives with undiagnosed schizophrenia around the 1960s-1980s. 
To be as accurate as possible, I've done extensive research only looking at reputable/peer-reviewed sources and firsthand accounts from real people with schizophrenia. 

I have a document with the outline for the story including all of my sources and the things I've learned so far. I will admit that I did not know a good bit of this information so educating myself on it was a real eye-opener. 
The reason I'm doing this is to bring awareness to schizophrenia and de-stigmatizing it by putting it in a different light. I feel that if neurotypical people can find themselves relating, becoming attached to the main character and empathizing rather than just sympathizing with him, it could really be something great and bring representation to a community that is usually negatively or falsely represented.
The last thing I want is to sensationalize a disorder that has ruined lives and taken so much from such a huge number of people (1% of the US population is a huge chunk!) just for some cheap entertainment. I feel that my writing can do the heavy lifting on its own. Plus, the whole schizophrenic psychopath trope is terribly played out, insensitive and quite frankly a very lazy route to take. 

So I suppose the reason I'm here is to ask more in-depth questions that I can't find online(I know how it feels to answer the same questions that can be easily
Found on google, so I most definitely won't be doing that to y'all) to be as accurate as possible. 
Also to get an opinion from you guys on the writing because I do not want to be inappropriate or offensive in the way you all are presented. 

This is a very important matter to me, and the more I research the more devoted and committed I am to it. I want this to be the best work I've ever written.

One of my employees (M/50's) is having some trouble and I was wondering if there have been any success stories with alternative treatments other than what is typically prescribed. He has been on all types of psych meds previously and is refusing to take them again (Don't blame him either). 

His particular hallucinations are auditory in his head and consist of angels and demons typically arguing over this and that. He is also convinced that these delusions are real and that he is having a spiritual issue rather than a mental one. 

He is a genuinely brilliant person and would not harm a fly. When he was here at work and had purpose he would have little to zero symptoms while here. From what I know, most of the trouble he would have is after hours at his house. A few weeks ago, we were off work for a long weekend due to a freeze.

"Hey guys, im a 27 year old male diagnosed with very mild schizoaffective depressive type (2020) and adhd inattentive (2016) I'm starting to think this is not normal. I've been trying to resolve an issue where i literally fall asleep anywhere while doing anything.

This got me fired from 2 jobs cause i wasnt meeting performance expectations. I also recently started reconnecting with my step-brother and he always complains that I'm quiet tells me to say something, anything. My father recently told me maybe i fall asleep so easily because my mind isn't stimulated.

I'm noticing that I always have a blank mind when im in conversation with anyone and almost all of the time. I have thoughts but they are very few. 

The only time my head gets filled with thoughts and I'm more talkative is if i vape cannabis (i got my license before i had delusions and voices) i do 1 puff and BAM! I'm hit by nonstop thoughts sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad. i know its a bad idea for me to use it but for some reason it doesnt trigger me like i thought it would. 

I wanted to know if any one else here experiences this and how do you overcome it? I want to be more social and access more life experiences. I want to get closer to my step-brother. But my blank mind is getting in the way.

Thank you for reading this.",Schizophrenia
I don't hear voices often but when I do they have always either been whispering things to me or yelling at me almost incoherently and there has never really been any in-between. Just a weird quirk to my condition specifically that I thought I'd share. At least it makes it easy to distinguish from reality given that people rarely if ever tend to aggressively and way-too-closely whisper nonsense into my ears.,Schizophrenia
"I took a lot of lorazepam and biperiden yesterday and the day before because I had a dystonic reaction in my face. At some point I actually hallucinated after 5 years of no hallucinations. But I was perfectly mentally sound, unbothered and actually curious about it. It was something between little hairs and sparks of electricity coming out of objects in the dark. But I know it's not a sz hallucination because akineton makes you hallucinate in big doses. I definitely took way too much. Interesting experience to hallucinate something that doesn't torture you one bit.",Schizophrenia

"So I'm diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression and I was looking at the DSM criteria for schizoaffective and that seems like it fits because it contains both the schizophrenia and the mood disorder. From what I read schizoaffective-depressive type would be if I have had at least a two week period of psychosis without mood symptoms which I have had. So I guess my question is how do you separate schizoaffective from schizophrenia and depression, especially if that depression stems from the fact that I have schizophrenia? Am I just overthinking this? Is it just a technicality regarding labels that just don't matter or is this something I should ask my psychiatrist about? I'm already being treated with both antipsychotics and antidepressants, so does it really matter at the end of the day what I call my disorder(s)?",Schizophrenia
"Do not read this unless you are in a good place mentally. It may potentially worsen or spark a delusion.

Since I was a teenager I've felt watched. Not the â€œmy house is hauntedâ€ watched, but the â€œpeople are monitoring my devices and forging fake friendships to gain information and catch me slippingâ€ type watched. I have lived my life over-inhibited. The only time I feel safe to be free is when I'm drunk (I behaved that way because I was drunk, you know) this caused me to have a hefty alcohol problem. I thought this would get better when they diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder and put me on antipsychotics, the voices/noises stopped, but I still feel completely disabled by this idea that everyone around me has bad intentions and are watching me. I can't discuss this with anyone because I get extremely anxious that something bad would happen if they found out I knew, and it's one of those â€œwho all is part of thisâ€ type things. I see posts on Reddit all the time and my first thought is â€œX posted this, they're trying to find my accountâ€, this is the only place I feel unknown, but I still try to comment and interact in a way people will find acceptable.  

This all causes huge problems connecting to people. A lot of the time I assume people in my life were placed there, I find it impossible to form genuine connections to people. My boyfriend doesn't even know I feel this way, but a lot of the times I feel like I don't have a genuine connection with him. I go out of my way to continue the narrative that everything in my life is going great in case the person I'm talking to is part of whatever is going on, or the account I'm posting on is connected to me. Like this post will probably be deleted, any post that shows less than acceptable content is deleted. When my brain detects too many signs that my account has been found out (when things get really bad, and typically the voices come back) I will delete the account, wait a couple of months and try again. I am very very cautious of my devices, and I often will do things I don't want to do when I'm home alone to seem normal in case I'm being recorded.

&gt;Why am I posting this? 

It's getting really bad right now. I feel like if I don't vent about it somewhere im going to burst, and hospitalization isn't an option because I feel that will be the point of no return (I already have really strong gut feelings about my brain being messed with/ mental manipulation)

&gt;What are you looking to gain?

Support of any kind. Does anyone else feel this way even on medication? Is there anything you've found that helps? I can't tell my doctor for reasons already stated.

My family tells me I need to be more mature sometimes. They say I should handle my emotions better. They want me to do more things on my own. I'm scared of the idea of that. But I want to be independent. 

Sometimes I wonder if my family is trying to get rid of me. They always get mail from respite services. I looked it up. They also go to support groups but try to hide it from me.

"I'm new to the community. I'm a 59 year old man whose father dealt with schizophrenia my entire life. He died in 1986 when I was 24. My mother died in 1998 when I was 35. Both left me with more questions than answers. I thought I'd ask some of you the questions I had for them.

1. I don't remember how I learned about my father's illness. My mother never sat down and had a talk with me or anything. It's almost as if I learned about him over the years by osmosis. Those of you who have children, or parents here whose spouse has schizophrenia, and also have children, how and when did you explain the illness to them?

2. My dad was dealing with schizophrenia during some of the dark ages of treatment. I know he was subjected to shock therapy at least once in his life. It seemed like the best the doctors could do for my dad was jeep him somewhat calm. He still talked and yelled at himself in various voices, and had to be hospitalized frequently. I'd not in that position he was so heavily drugged that he could oy speak in very slow sentences. What strides in medicine gave been made in the past 40 years? I hope many!

3. My father wrote, alot. My earliest memories are of him typing in the basement on a manual typewriter. By the time he died his writings were more like quickly scribbled words on scrap paper. I still have his writings. I e only looked at them once, shortly after dis death. It was too much for me to handle at that time. What would you think should be done with these writings? If they were your writings what would you like done with them?

I guess that's the majority of my questions. I know he lived a tormented life, and I feel bad for what he had to endure. That being said I never doubted his love. He was the best father for me he could be. On occasion I was able to see a glint in his eye and hear a tone of voice that would show me what he would've been like had he been free of his illness. Those moments are so special to me. I still cherish most every memory of him I have, and I love him dearly to this day.

"and it's been mostly wonderful, but the issue is that he hasn't accepted his diagnosis yet. He believes that his delusions are real, as they are for him of course, but I'm concerned that, until he comes to terms with his mental state, we won't be able to move forward in a healthy way. Is this a fair assessment on my part? I have tried to be supportive without being encouraging when he's experiencing his symptoms and he's had some amazing epiphanies when we've talked things through,  but I'm also concerned that even when we make progress it's back to square one the next go around. Additionally, part of him feels that letting go of his delusions is allowing â€œthemâ€ to get away with what they're doing, so I feel that there's a part of him that doesn't want to shut the voices out for that reason. I'm under no false ideas that I can â€œfixâ€ him, but I guess I'm just wondering if we can have a relatively healthy, stable-enough relationship if he is still in the denial stage of his diagnosis?

At around 7 o'clock her throat started closing up I told my mum to got the hospital but she denied and said it will get better within a few hours. At around 10 oclock it got even worse and she couldnt breath so she took her to the hospital. She was at the very edge  of suffocation.

\------------------Page Break----------------------

Years ago, I had mental health problems that I believe I've made a great deal of progress with. As of recent, I've had a complicated several years where I've been trying to break through the status quo of different irregular circumstances that have happened throughout different employment situations in the recent past. I've been very fortunate to have received Veteran's Compensation for a condition I've been diagnosed with. In fact, I'm rated at 100%, but I haven't let that detract me from the ability that I know I have of leaving the Veteran's Compensation behind to work fulltime in a capacity that I might be suitable for. 

Let me back up a little bit to give you a better idea of how some of these things may have started. I believe my arguments with some of my immediate family members after leaving the armed services may have been somewhat authoritative at the time, years ago, just beyond 2009. Thus, I may have had an element of an adjustment disorder after my time serving in the military. In fact, although I usually hid it well, my thought process to a certain degree and quite regularly was paranoid, which lined up with element of unemployment or underemployment and a general lack of direction with regards to my life. 

I was taken to a mental health hospital by a police officer in 2011 for something I did which was raise my voice at another police officer while I was asking him why they were in the neighborhood. My paranoid attitude had contributed to that. Fortunately, I was given treatment instead of incarceration. After about a week and a half, I was suddenly removed from the mental health center in a large city in the south and dropped off at a homeless shelter that had a timeline registration requirement. I didn't have a cellphone and was trying to get back to where I lived, so I found myself missing the registration to the homeless center and trying to walk from there, downtown, all the way to the outskirts of an outside suburb, where throughout several hours of waiting in various places into the next day, mid-day, I was eventually given a ride to the town that I lived in that was over an hour away, driving. The distance that I walked was almost as long as the Bataan death march, and my knees were getting injured and almost giving in. I'm not trying to give you a sad story; I'm just trying to tell you what the realities of a mental health struggle might look like. 

Later in 2012, my family caught me speaking to the television. As a result, that time, I again spent time in a mental health hospital, but this time for about two months. I went to court for the continuation determination and then was sent to a Veteran's Affairs Hospital, only to end up telling the psychiatrist, â€œI was speaking to the television as though I was speaking in the mirror to myself.â€ I was then for that reason, let go within a matter of a few days. 

I should note that each of these hospitalizations usually ends up costing the person hospitalized thousands of dollars if they are uninsured. I was uninsured at the time; the compensation I had ended up receiving helped me to a great extent get out of the financial pitfall I found myself in, not only due to the health center costs, but also the credit card debt I had accumulated due to unemployment, underemployment, and one, two, or a handful of mistakes I've made.

Consequentially, I believe a couple of years before, I'm unsure exactly how long and to no person in specific, I sent an email, mostly to friends, that indicated that I thought I was or may be schizophrenic. During the hospitalization in 2012, there would be a doctor that would diagnose me with this condition, a diagnosis that would continue with me throughout the years. Although my adjustment disorder has improved, over the years I've been overly disadvantaged in application to my professional advancement. 

I know I have probably been diagnosed properly in the past and know I have had at the very least psychosis during one time frame. However, throughout the next two to three years after my hospitalization in 2012, I would live, at first, through the support of my family, and soon afterwards with the approved Veterans Compensation I would receive. 

The medication that I was placed on, would make me gain weight and maintain the condition as that of having a large goofy smile on my face. I found out soon that the anti-depressant I was on was at too high of a level. I spoke with my psychiatrist and eventually, with his help, fixed that part of my life. During that period, I'll admit that I didn't apply to many positions, but I remember eventually focusing on advanced education to move my life forward. I remember shortly after studying for the General Management Administration Test (GMAT) in 2015, I was browsing several education programs online. A very peculiar thing happened, I received a suggestion that I should apply to a certain type of master's degree program. 

I did well and graduated from the master's degree with a relatively good grade point average. Around the end of 2017, while I was studying for the master's in homeland security, I wrote on word documents within my laptop with the internet connected, everything in the past that I remembered may have been a violation of the law that I did all the way from a minor up to an adult. Where I don't believe I did much illegal activity recently, I focused on old things that I've done. Many of those weren't complicated to understand and they were mostly things that a foolish teenager might be involved with.

Risk &amp; Financial Advisory position

In late 2018, I was hired on for an e-Discovery position that was labelled as Risk and Financial Advisory Associate for a global accounting firm. After joining, the position became a Risk and Financial Advisory Consultant position. The position I was initially hired for was in a country in Europe, and it was done by a Managing Director that was promoted to Principal in a large metropolitan city in Texas. This person was purportedly prior service. 

The workplace environment within the European country seemed confusing. Yet I was assured by my Partner Escalation Point that the individuals at the workplace didn't know that I had been diagnosed with a condition. The words that were used are delineated below. From my perspective, it could be described as though I was intentionally assigned a sociological problem by someone. However, there was intent with the words used by the individuals. Supposing it were a sociological problem it might seem to reflect or might not reflect on my diagnosis. Phrases were regularly made by others within the team that seemed to be directed towards me. Although I'm unsure what their exact knowledge was, and with risk of sounding somewhat ostentatious, it was clearly some form of workplace harassment. I left the firm because of it. I may have had the option to stay in the United States, but with assurance that it might be difficult for me to obtain the next position, or contract to work under. There were also a few things that led me to fear some form of retaliation. The Managing Director or Principal who hired me who continued to have oversight over me cussed a lot and was intimidating. The manager who was my coach, although he was very empathetic when I told him I was schizophrenic, he clearly enunciated, ""I don't want to see you succeed"" amongst the other things he said. At this point I had been diagnosed with schizophrenia for several years but was aware and somewhat understanding with regards to the statements that people made that I knew were real. These and other things led me to believe that there was something going on that would cause me a significant amount of difficulty if I continued in the position I was in, so I decided to leave. 

The workplace environment at the worksite within the European country was very unprofessional. The fact that I left this position was of a significant impact to me. I believe the act of receiving a job offer or a career after graduating should have been good. It ended up being a setback in this instance, because I could have obtained another position, even a better position that wouldn't have forced me to leave, leaving me without that needed income. The comments that were made were unsettling with regards to what I was attempting to do professionally, which mostly involved the actual e-Discovery work. I also felt retaliated against for some reason I was unsure about. I didn't know these people very well, but it was still a very unnerving process to go through. 

After a conversation over the phone with someone who was figuratively close to me, I received a few phrases that I could use that I hadn't been using in the instances of what I consider to be harassment. The phrases are the following: ""Y'all aren't really fun to work with."" ""Y'all are annoying."" ""You guys have the wrong attitude."" Unfortunately, it hadn't been in my nature to use phrases like that. At one point, I used the first phrase somewhat emphatically enough to where my thoughts would be expressed correctly. It was at a point where several people were talking in English, and I had no clue what they were talking about. It seemed like they were trying to pass off again as being technical related to work, but I wasn't buying it. The two people discussing these issues seemed somewhat surprised when I used the phrase. 

As the day continued, it occurred to me that it would probably be best that I write what was being said down. This is how November 14th went: A few others and I met for a taxi near the train station and exchanged casual pleasantries. I sat in the front seat and paid for the taxi. After arriving to the door of the collections room and saying goodbye to the other two, they walked away. As they left, I said to my coworker ""I have the key."" The person from another European country, who happened to be from another team within the firm working in the area, repeated, and laughed at a distance mockingly, ""I have the key"" and there was a sharp contrast with regards to how he acted at a distance. He also said this as though there may be an issue with me having the key. 

At some point, I overheard the deputy manager harassing someone for being arrogant. On the previous day I had been speaking about arrogance with regards to that person, but to the outside leadership I was reporting to. It wasn't my intention to make that an issue for that type of confrontation. 

On November 13th, the deputy manager made a reference to a ""Mighty Drive"". When I asked a coworker what that meant, he said, ""I don't know. A thumb drive?"" The deputy manager in essence seemed to make a mockery of cultural differences by saying that. Meanwhile, people from the other team would walk in and refer to someone by saying something like, â€œHow much longer will he be here?â€ She seemed to have said this about someone in that office while in the other room with the deputy manager and others. But it seemed to be implicit of something more like â€œHow much longer can he take it?â€ I continued the day quietly. 

When talking about a barcode label, the deputy manager was talking to someone else I was working with, and randomly said, ""That weirdo too"". I said, ""I'm sorry you think about me that way"". He then said, ""What?"" I then said, ""You said, 'that weirdo too'"" After that he said, ""Yeah, so"". That seemed to have been indifference and lack of professionalism. I believe it also clearly showed that I was the odd man out in the room. When returning, the deputy manager exclaimed, ""You see, now we can shoot it."" He seemed to be talking about someone on the current side of the office I was in, and they weren't using any cameras. I checked and there were no cameras visible in that side of the room at that point. It wasn't clear what he was talking about with regards to, ""Now we can shoot it"" but I'm pretty sure I wasn't missing any other part of the conversation that would indicate it was about a camera. One of my coworkers then said ""Maybe his computer is slashing me"" as I was going to get a flat metallic device that's used to pry open a laptop for the work I was doing. Even though it may have been implicit of me not slashing him, but my computer doing so, in the sense that it seemed to refer to what I was doing at that moment of time, â€œGetting a flat metallic deviceâ€ but to pry open a laptop. It also seems to be something that you might say to a criminally insane person or someone like that to taunt him to do more criminal activity. It's things like these that really offended me.

""No one is getting promoted. They are going to test him and give him the password.""â€¦. 

Later that day a battery, shows up very close to the station I was working at. No one was processing computers at that station shortly before that time, someone clearly left a battery there. I just assumed whoever found it was returning it. The deputy manager was purportedly on the phone with the manager, who was currently away in the United States, told him, ""They attacked two devices."" The deputy manager then said to another colleague there ""Get rid of him"" purportedly about some chain of custody that a colleague was taking care of. 

At one point shortly afterwards, a colleague walks into the room and says ""All chopped up"" while holding a camera in his hand. I asked him what he meant. In response, he tells me that he guessed he meant that the thumb drive was all messed up. He says that his English was bad. However, although a self-proclaimed atheist, he said it with faith in his eyes. What he said at the time let me down further because I had believed his initial statement and realized shortly afterwards that he was holding a camera. (Although he was just entering the door, I suppose it could have been implicit of being the camera that wasn't visible above.)

I should emphasize that the people in the group were saying all these things casually; it seemed to be more of an acting out of phrases than anything else. Although I didn't see much risk in any bodily harm being done to me, I still considered much of it to be highly offensive.

Later that afternoon or evening, the deputy manager explained the procedure that was going to be followed with regards to imaging a device. The room gets tense due to his demeanor. The deputy manager randomly uses the word ""Toasted"" purportedly with regards to a chain of custody or a file name. The deputy manager then shortly after that says, ""and then he's my friend"" randomly as a way to allegedly ask for a quality check from one of the other colleagues. As you can see this seems to require an element of forethought about the type of words they would be using, particularly as I'm asking someone else around me. Clearly, there's a lack of professionalism. All these individuals involved, unless otherwise mentioned, purportedly work for the same global accounting firm. 

On the first day in the office in the European country, the first element of a lack of professional behavior was demonstrated when I first arrived by the deputy manager, who wasn't from the European country I was in. He said, ""One thing you'll find out here is that we are as racist as f\*\*k."" The lack of professionalism continued. One of the Americans said, ""I think I'm going to steal some luggage."" That had resonated as something that had recently happened to me in the United States at a storage unit I was renting. (Although I don't believe that any of them would have been directly involved with it.) 

One of the first few days I was there, someone in his late forties or perhaps even fifties followed me to a location and quoted something about a â€œ$100,000â€ and â€œis goodâ€, seeming to be implicit of a compensation valuation. One or two days later, I'm unsure of what day, that same person followed me and said something like â€œ$100,000â€ and â€œis not goodâ€. He might not have been with the big four accounting firm, may have been local or with the company local to the country I was in, and was using the English language, although it probably wasn't his native tongue.

The third day the deputy manager made a reference to a computer or a hard drive being crazy, ""Well then it must be crazy."" That didn't make much sense to me. The deputy manager spoke English well enough to where I don't believe he would be using English incorrectly that way. It was more likely intentional and more likely that he would be referring to a person. As you can see, from this point the workplace was clearly an unprofessional workplace environment. 

Closer to the end of the about week-and-a-half I was there, I was on the phone with a senior manager in charge of labor relations. She proceeded to tell me that she didn't see the significance in what I was telling her and seemed to have been implicitly indicating that it was normal all-the-while refusing to acknowledge that she was trying to say that it was normal. I'm unsure if she wanted more information, but she didn't really seem to want to call it anything. I told her that it was offensive that she would be passing this off as ""normal"" or the ""status quo"" after I had to go through it for the last week and a half. I unfortunately was left with no option but to be angry throughout the latter three quarters of my conversation with her, even though being an angry person is now hardly ever characteristic of me. Again, she said she wasn't calling it ""normal"" or the ""status quo"", but she did say that she didn't see the significance in it. She also said that she would be going to that office in Germany to investigate. She did say that I could book my travel back to the United States and did say that she didn't believe I was hearing things. I suppose that it was a coincidence that the principal and the partner were on PTO according to what they had posted. 

A mid-sized city in the south

After all this, around the end of 2018, when I arrived at the main car rental counter an International Airport, I spoke with a customer service representative about a car rental I was returning. There was a customer service representative that I overheard from a car-rental agency nearby that was harassing a lady. The person said the following: â€œAt this point all I want to know is if you're going to church.â€ There was some time in between the two statements. â€œYou know, I hear people returning from Afghanistan with PTSD find meditation to be very useful.â€ The lady exclaimed, â€œTake me out of this place!â€ and she paced back and forth in front of the counter once or twice. There were periods where they seemed to be waiting for a response. Although I was busy speaking about the rental I had, I feel somewhat guilty that I didn't step in to help the nearby lady.

For those outside onlookers into this Reddit forum, I should point out that throughout all these things I'm telling you, I'm not asking you to advocate for me, but maybe you should at least turn your attitude around about people that do have severe mental and physical disabilities. As for me, I believe I'm competent enough and would prefer to personally take things like these to court and intend to if these types of situations continue.

A large metropolitan city in the west (May 2019 â€“ September 2019)

I was employed for the Federal Government within the large metropolitan city in the west for a short period of time. The thing you needed to do to advance on the job seemed natural to me. I was attempting to work as hard as possible before and especially throughout the last week-and-a-half I was there. It was challenging but also mostly irritating. I wrote the following down on my government computer and then took a photo of it. The things in parenthesis were what other employees were saying in order:

â€œYou've got to be more specific, Roman is requestingâ€

â€œWe currently have people dyingâ€

At work, there regularly seems like there's someone right around the corner talking about the work that I'm involved with or something that could be related... There are other people, colleagues, that are closer that I could probably go talk to about it. Do you suggest that I talk to them? What would I say?

â€œSeanâ€¦ welcome to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_â€ (Email from Supervisor)

â€œfive yearsâ€ ???

Something about â€œgetting there soonerâ€

\------------------------- Page Break ------------------------

â€œRomanâ€ may refer to, â€œWhen in Rome, do as the Romans.â€ It could also be a biblical reference as in the Epistle of Romans a lot of the content was applicable to faith and government considering it was a letter the Apostle Paul wrote to the Romans. The following was later or one of the following days:

\------------------------- Page Break -------------------------

I said the following, â€œDo you know why \*\*\*male person\*\*\* hasn't been coming in anymore? Is he okay?â€

Response from someone else: â€œWhy? Do you love him?â€ (Somewhat sharp voice)

â€œWrong againâ€ (Someone else)

â€œSo turrets huh?â€ â€œYeahâ€

\------------------------ Page Break -----------------------------

One person I had met, who had been employed by the government agency for several years before randomly said to people in my class, â€œHe has spies.â€ Due to my focus on getting work done, I never really confronted one of the other employees with the concepts they were using, even though some people I didn't know did somewhat raise their voices on a few occasions leading me to feel anxious and pressured to do more work. I had previously reported other instances of people mentioning unusual elements of symmetric information related to my past. The results seemed to vary. Over the course of about the last week, or week-and-a-half, the situation seemed very arduous. I talked to an assistant manager who had participated in the strenuous process by asking him if he was on the headset with someone, telling him that I would be moving to a different cubicle. He began to act like a normal person and said, â€œokayâ€ while pretending he wasn't doing anything. I heard someone at a relatively close distance saying, â€œThat's not it.â€ I talked to my supervisor who happened to be in the other corner of the floor to let him know that I wanted to or would attempt to move cubicles. He said that the intent was to keep us together as a group. He didn't seem to know what was going on, and I don't believe I expressed what was going on in the area correctly at the time. This resulted in me remaining in my cubicle area, which in turn ultimately led to a panic attack where I felt forced to no longer stay on the job. At this point, I hadn't served in the military now for about ten years. 

A small metropolitan city in the south

I should probably also mention that it's not because I behave erratically while on the job, nor am I somehow ever so slightly unable to perform the job. I'm very capable of performing the jobs I've had, particularly recently. The fact is that there has within the past few years been situations that come up at work that are personal, and it boggles my mind how it reaches my coworkers. 

It might also be in the middle of a statement about a completely different topic, but there sometimes could be the interpretation of negativities in the interconnected comments themselves. I sometimes feel fortunate when the coworkers have a good attitude throughout the course of employment while they are making these comments and in the in between times. 

The coincidences add up and for these interrelated reasons and others, I was writing my resignation letter at this place of employment. I simultaneously after heard my supervisor speaking to someone over the phone in the other room saying, â€œWell, now we're talking about a former employee soâ€¦â€ From my discussion with him, he intended to keep the rest of his employees working there. Things like these, and there's a lot of them, make it impossible to be anything else other than people speaking about me, such as when on the phone with someone else, and the plausible deniability behind my claims of what I acknowledge are reality, because of being labelled a schizophrenic. I then leave the positions in hopes of finding a new one where I'm not faced with the unhappiness of going through these potentially negative comments, even if done in the most light-hearted way, it's something that I've learned to mostly hate. I've tried to explain similar situations to lawyers and have been told to seek an accommodation. I personally believe that requesting an accommodation in my case might defeat its own purpose, particularly when it involves professional advancement over the long run beyond the entry or associate level within the same company or organization. That's one of the reasons why I've never gone through with completely requesting one. It's also a problem of the process of having to request an accommodation. I'm under the impression that you must identify the behavior that you need stopped. It could also be something that might be embarrassing as you might see.

\--------------------- Page Break ---------------------------

So, the problem seems to usually present itself as an employment ethics problem. I should mention that I don't personally intend to confront the comments as they come up because they regularly involve uncivilized terms and phrases. I consider myself to be a professional at work and consider a lot of what happens to be a demoralization or an attacking of character.

Some of it seems it could go back to the fact that I've been very fortunate to have received Veteran's Compensation for a condition I've been diagnosed with. In fact, I'm rated at 100%. The fact is that I'm trying to replace and eventually forgo the compensation. Over time, I've learned that doing this too fast (multiple applications at a time) doesn't work very well, and the long-term approach (getting a second master's degree) might be unnecessary and potentially too long of a process. 

I believe that after someone obtains their education, someone should focus on certifications. (And it's taken me a long time to learn that.) I'm working on certifications now that will hopefully and eventually provide the opportunity to enter the workforce fulltime to provide my immediate family and I, outside of the service industry work that I'm currently involved with that might supplement some of the compensation. 

I'm a firm believer that just because some doctor or psychiatrist has diagnosed you with a condition you shouldn't be limited to advance and move forward in your life. I don't believe anyone trying to do the right thing should be limited for the rest of their life. People can improve their outlook and their lives, and move towards a better trajectory. Remember this.

â€œLife is amazing. And then it can be awful. And then it's amazing again. The world isn't against you nor is it out to get you. Everyone makes mistakes, despite that life is breathtakingly beautiful. We're all human. Life also isn't a problem to be solved, but work through your mistakes, believe in yourself, and plan for a future fulfilling the values of your forefather's, along with God's will. To have and to show integrity, service, humility, and respect. To grow and to also cultivate the lives of others. - Unknown

"You all know what schizophrenia is. it devastates you, makes feel you dazed, numb, distressed isolated. and it is life sentience. life is ruined and there is no way out but death. at least that's my case..

"So I've been taken my current meds, Invega, for nearly 2 years now and while it's been the only medication I've had no side effects with, I've also gained extreme amounts of weight (nearly 90 pounds gained within that time span). I gained 30 pounds in 3 months and then another 40 pounds within the next 5 months. I diet, I've started fasting, and I work out, yet my weight hasn't gone down at all. And to put into perspective, on my old meds maintaining the same life style I have now (its actually healthier on my current meds) I weighed around 185 and maintained that weight fine. But now I can't seem to do anything without gaining it. I'm still young and would not chock this up to metabolism.

I just wanted to share this because I wanted to see if anybody else had severe weight gain with their meds and whether that forced them to change meds. I've been on 3 different meds and have relapsed on all but this one and I feel like myself with Invega. I'm just worried my doctor will want me to change meds, and I'm worried of the health risks I have encountered and whether than counteracts how well the meds works for me. Any advice?",Schizophrenia

It started coincidentally right after I got turned away from 2 therapy places and people on the bus seemed to nervous laugh when I walk by.

"So, basically what the title says - my partner has schizophrenia, though they don't entirely acknowledge it as such and I try to be as respectful of their experience as I can without feeding into their auditory delusions. The issue is that now the voices have started to say things about me - it's not that I didn't entirely expect this, but what they're saying is pretty hurtful and I'm having a difficult time separating what the voices are saying from what my partner actually thinks. My other concern is that eventually these voices will wear my partner down to the point that they start to believe these things themself or want to move on from our relationship because of what they're telling them. I do love them and I want to work through my own feelings about this, as well as be supportive of them, but it is a lot to handle.

"Hello I believe this is my first post. Now to the point about a month ago I was out for a drink (don't worry I'm not an alcoholic I usually go out and just have one to take the edge off) and I noticed the bartender was very attractive and she was cleaning some of the chairs and I decided to flirt with her (admittedly it was just for the hell of it since I thought I had no chance with her) but surprisingly we hit it off and I gave her my number and surprisingly again she texted me back that night and we talked more. 

Moving forward she has two kids from a previous relationship and she texts me very rarely but it's only because she's busy with her kids and work. I really liked her though she is a very pleasant person to talk to and a huge nerd which is a plus. As a result I asked her out and she said yes unfortunately the day came and I had to work and the stress of seeing this girl and making a good impression was a lot. Also I have college to worry about and I've been cramming for finals and I have been stressed greatly. But so has she, she's been having some plumbing problems at home and wasn't sure if she would make it for our get together so I decided we should focus on what we need to right now (ex me with school and her with her kids and fixing that plumbing problem) I told her that and she was perfectly fine with that and wished me the best with everything. We talk every now and then and I try to see her when she's working the weekends (she told me she works on the weekends) unfortunately again busy so I haven't seen her in about a month 


But the thing is I have a very very big fear that I'm going to do something to drive her away or that she'll ghost me and it's a lot to take in I just have a moment of being happy and I don't want to lose it and have it be something that I did.",Schizophrenia

"First of all, happy easter everyone. I hope you can enjoy a few days off and spend some time with your family. We just had a little gathering this morning, and after coming back, it just came to my mind that I haven't checked this place in quite some time, nor have I posted anything. Which is what I'm doing now. While I don't have a title in mind in the moment of writing this line, I still hope you get some value out of my post.

There have been times since I've been diagnosed, which was more than a decade ago, where the illness itself hasn't even been on my mind much. It ranged from having the delusion that I was cured, over just thinking about it when it's med time, to being obsessed about it in an unhealthy way, thinking about it all the time. Of course it's been on my mind whenever I was having symptoms, after I really understood what was going on and having insight finally.

At the moment I'm just enjoying a stable, symptom-free time in my life. I'm seeing my therapist every few months for a short visit, and last time he ended our conversation asking me, what do I want more. I couldn't answer that question at that point, and I'm still not sure if I can already. But it made me thinking about if there is something that helps you after you've learned to manage your illness well. To be fair, I'm still on the search for (further) answers. Still, I've found a rough direction already.

On a scale from -10 to 10, therapy brings you to 0. And there are talented therapists out there, who are doing a good job at that. But are they really motivated to try to push you further, after you've reached stability? Isn't it easier if they don't have much work to do with you anymore? I mean, wasn't it hard enough already to bring you from a negative 10 to zero? I mean, maybe you can even reach the positive points on the scale whilst in therapy, but that is outside the aim, also of your insurance, I guess.

I've asked myself, how do I get to a 10? Not saying all the time, but maybe a stable seven? Aside from this stupid number scale, what do I really want more out of life? I think to aim towards becoming the best version of myself that I can be. So now this sounds like I've read a few self-improvement books, and I did, I also went to some seminars and watched dozens of hours of YouTube videos about the topic. While it did help a bit, ironically the most powerful idea I got out of it was just that you can even try to improve your life at all.

Like knowing that depression ends at some point if you overcame multiple episodes, knowing that it can also get better from neutral to a more positive experience of life was honestly a pretty huge shift in my thinking. Of course I didn't have linear progress from there on, which isn't possible, still my life slowly improved. But what was even more important from me, was getting the help from other people. Because what's even more important than ""the power from within"" is the power of community. Other people can be your life insurance, and here is why:

I'll start with my most recent example. The difficulty of being stable is definitively taking enough of your antipsychotic medication to make sure to not experience psychotic symptoms, while not being too negatively affected by side effects. I have a friend to whom I talk to on the phone often, but when we meet each other, he can notice within seconds of talking to me whether I'm fully there, or else he'll ask me if I made any changes to my medication. Whilst this can seem annoying, which I can understand, there is a difference between situations like this and the old ""didn't take your meds, huh?"" in situations where you 

1. did take them and 

2. whatever made the person say this statement had nothing to do with your medication or illness.

The latter you obviously don't want. But what I'm describing is feedback you'll need at a certain stage. And I'm grateful to get this kind of feedback by a hypersensitive friend before other people start to notice it. Which is what I say thank you to him for. Other examples of people being your life insurance include a friend basically renting me his living room for a month so I could get a final paper done for school, which helped me with overcoming procrastination and limiting negative symptoms impacting me, as far as that was possible.

What else can you do? Well, it depends on your budget, but you can pay people directly to help you. Here you need to be careful, of course. But as with self-help books, take what helps you personally - I can't know what services will help you the most, and reject what doesn't. I've personally paid a trainer to help me on a bodily level, especially learning how to take pressure out of my body via little mobility exercises has reduced my stress levels a lot. I still go to physiotherapy once a month, which are probably the best 27 dollars I spend from my fixed costs.

Then I've done another thing, which is to continue working with a coach I knew from my former workplace. You may say that the concept of solving inner blockages is a little out there, and I do also think it is, but it worked wonders for me. Since this is very hard to describe what the coach is actually doing and how it's working, I just want to encourage you to keep doing whatever is really helping you. Even if it's a little woo-woo, if the results are actually there, keep doing it. My ""results"" were that I need a third less of my antipsychotic and that I need way less time to recover from smaller stressful events. Still, run away if someone promises you to be able to come off your meds with the help of their technique. I know it could be due to other effects that I was able to reduce my medication a little bit, which is why I'm careful with my claims. But as long as you can rule out that something is harming you, why not make use of the placebo effect.

Since my post has become pretty long already, I want to end it by first of all thanking you for reading it until here. Even though I'm not that optimistic about it gaining much attention on a selfie sunday - not that I care, I still want to ask you: What are your experiences ""beyond therapy""? Have you found something that helps you go further, and move towards your goals that came to your mind after you reached a level of stability that you're happy with? For now, my passion is teaching, but since only explaining how to write computer code gets a little boring from time to time, I've decided to return to this subreddit again and write in my typical style. Hope you liked it, and I'm happy to hear from you in the comments, until Easter is over and I retreat once more from here, only to return in the future with new insights for you.",Schizophrenia

But, the conclusion I'm coming to is that there isn't really a volunteer position or therapy program that will be life changing. The therapy places I called weren't accepting new patients and I'm wondering what I can do. I get delusions of reference that I shouldn't go back to putting on some movies or try to lose weight to pass the time. Sometimes it feels like anything I do can draw a negative reaction besides sitting at home, isolating from the outside world, more or less not doing anything besides self care.

"I still have a few weird thoughts but I can fight them super easily now that I worked my ass of to cure my paranoÃ¯a. Life is so much better when you're not terrified of being attacked all the time. I'm able to laugh genuinely, I enjoy hugs and social gatherings...etc.

What worked for me was to learn about all the different kind of delusions and to reason myself as much as possible, all day long if necessary. I started slowly by reminding me that cops can't be after me because they have better things to do, that people don't mock me behind my back for the same reasons and, if some people do it, they are just assholes and I don't want to be their friend anyway. I did this kind of thing for every delusion I had, and I had many of them. When I was scared of bugs being under my skin, I searched online for the illnesses that could do this and I analyzed the symptoms to be sure that I was fine. It took around 5 month, sometimes I still see undercover cops but I guess that I have to live with this now, it doesn't make me feel terrified and paranoid anymore, I gained a lot in insight.

I also learned to destroy my delusion with the police being after me by reminding myself that the police should help me because I am disabled. They probably wouldn't, but it's their job.

I'm lucky that my family ad my friends are supportive, it probably helps a lot.

Anyway, what I wanted to say I that winning against paranoÃ¯a is possible. The meds help us a lot but they only make us able to fight, they don't magically cure the delusions. We have to fight the illness and it's not that hard when you find the right way to do it. I'll be symptom free soon",Schizophrenia

"I wanted to post this in a location where the most people could see a significant benefit from it. My main issue is regarding the activities of various government agencies and offshoot subsidiaries. A lot of the content that is publicly available from the government themselves offer absolutely no disclaimer regarding the potential effects it may have on an individual who is prone to or currently suffering from many different psychological disorders.

The issue is, they offer the reader (when all of them are read and taken into context TOGETHER) a very simple avenue to begin to question their own self. Essentially, the phenomena can actually manifest in the individual convincing themselves that they are in fact a manufactured ""manchurian candidate"" of sorts and that they are being convinced into research specifically by their unknown handler that is covering up the programming via amnesia (which is stated as a technique in the aforementioned  declassified government documentation).

You should be able to see my point here, people suffering from DID and/or delusions would be VERY prone to this. I myself am writing this because the phenomena is something I'm struggling with quite a bit these days.

"From what I hear by experts on drug induced psychosis I'm pretty sure that's what I have.

I haven't met someone who understands both or in my opinion really understands schizophrenia and I must know.

"Hello friends ðŸ‘‹ðŸ» I'm at respite at the moment (a comfy house with staff and it's like a bridge between being in hospital or in the community) and just wanted to share a little win and get some advice if possible!

I showered, brushed my teeth, moisturized my face and body, and put on clean clothes and I physically feel so much fresher and nicer!! I know y'all will know what it's like when we don't do that stuff for a while ðŸ˜… so taking it as a win to be able to manage it! 

Possible trigger warning for discussion of voices and â€œdelusionsâ€ that are spiritual in nature:

Some voices have told me that I am a Demon. That it's like a reverse possession with having people in my mind who are trying to control me and get me to kill myself because I'm evil, and saying that the antipsychotics are to medicate me as a Demon and keep me under control, rather than treating a person with an illness. I'm the kind of being that keeps things to myself to prevent feeling like a burden or a nuisance to other people and I come across as chirpy and okay almost all the time no matter what's going on, I've been like this for as long as I can remember. Does anyone have any advice for letting that guard down and talking to people (or staff in this case) about what's going on and being okay with being honest that I'm not okay? 

It's a bit trickier though because I don't feel like I can trust staff because I feel like they know I'm a Demon, like they would've been told by my mental health team and they can't definitely be trustworthy. I think I need to accept that I'm on my own with this but it just sucks when support would be really nice but it just doesn't feel safe but I can't help but get frustrated with myself at the same time. 

That was a bit of stream of consciousness but I hope it makes some sense, if anyone has any thoughts or advice that would be amazing!

"Today was just so horribleâ€¦I had a really bad Episode at work today. It was so much more different than any other my episodes of them.  Normally I always have a really bad Dissociation episode before I start having a full blown hallucination fit along with full blown anxiety. 


But my hallucinations just fuckin started. I kept seeing a man in the walls looking at me, and then they Screaming started, along with the voices who just yell and yell. 


Then static took  over everything'sâ€¦.and so much more


I ended up going to The Er just to be told I am not a priority since I don't want to kill myself or Kill others. 


I am to scared to tell them the horrible ways I have thought about itâ€¦like in the most Gory ways will play out in my mindâ€¦and the voice will tell me to do it and that no one would care and be happy at my Deathâ€¦

"My mental health seems decent today. Didn't get into any serious problems. I want to do something and called around for therapy but the places I called were booked. Sometimes I have delusions people who are damned want me to love them, but oftentimes all they want to talk to me about is their mental illness. Everyone in support group acts like they can relate to each other, but they are very different and their experiences are very different. I have decided not to look more into therapy but sometimes I get intrusive thoughts that I should get involved in something. Sometimes it feels like people use sympathy to justify whatever they want like maybe everyone should be a god except me because I didn't experience Hell nor do I want to. I don't really know but I don't want to turn into a blank check and either way I don't have the power or knowledge to make those kinds of decisions. I am looking forward to Kawaii Kon next week.

I don't understand why my BFF acts the way she does, gushing about support group members like they are the only people who are people and everyone else is not good enough.

"I have a theory on hallucinations in the populace. About 20% of people in the world have experienced hallucinations in their lifetime. Yet when we hear what hallucinations do negatively, Hearing voices, or visual hallucinations, are generally portrayed as the horrors they can be, and only that. Why do we only have negative views of psychosis? I believe that there are a large chunk of the populous that experience good and enjoyable hallucinations. It's just because of the stigma of psychosis, theses people are totally silent, afraid of what medicine and admission can do. It's possible that these people don't need medical help, and are avoiding admitting the truth it the event that they are prescribed something that fuck's with their brain.",Schizophrenia
"Hey, everyone. I could use some advice. Has anyone ever tried quetiapine? I'm taking 100mg, which is supposed to be a small dose. If you did, did it give you anxiety? I'm trying to figure out if it's best I quit (in case I'm experiencing anxiety) or increase the dose (in case I'm experiencing psychotic symptoms).

Thing is, I saw someone else's post here about thinking people hate them and I realized I've been afraid of it too. It's not something I was ever concerned about in the past, but I couldn't help but pick apart the way they looked and spoke to me yesterday, and I feel really bad about it for some reason. I'm really not used to deal with this sort of stuff, I've spent so long without being able to care for anything if I wanted to and now I'm almost crying because someone looked at me wrong. It's really strange, and I wonder if that's what anxiety feels like?

To be fair, I also remember I was afraid people were going to mug me or whatever in the way back. And the thoughts did pop up in my head like they used to, but not so strong I think. I mean, I was reaching in my pocket to give my wallet to a guy before he crossed the street and walked away from me, but I was not frightened like I usually am. Living where I live and given that was dark out, those are not unreasonable ideas I think.

I am no longer afraid or feeling bad presences inside my house like I was a little while ago too.

My vision remains weird, but I was told that is visual snow and something unrelated, although I didn't really have any of those problems a little over month ago. Just putting it here in case it's useful context.

I would speak to my psychiatrist, but I am already feeling really bad about how people think of me, can't bring myself to bother them. So, does anybody have any experience with this sort of complication when taking quetiapine?

I'm having a rough time. I'm recovering from a break

could it be a brain tumor? is this typical for sz? I'm really thinking about it, and it's consuming me.

"I have read that abilify helps with anhedonia and apathy but after having my dose increased that is exactly what I'm feeling. I'm also on an antidepressant but it hasn't worked yet, but it's only been a week or two.",Schizophrenia
"I took the approach of treating SZ like a spirochete infection, and took an old treatment for syphillis (a spirochete,) potassium iodide, to good effect.

I also rounded it out with salt loading, which is a good biocidal and great for digestion (stomach acid is largely salt.) The good digestion helped with gut / brain axis healing (otherwise undigested proteins would pass through the intestinal barrier and irritate / ""loosen"" the blood-brain barrier)

""Undigested Food and Gut Microbiota May Cooperate in the Pathogenesis of Neuroinflammatory Diseases: A Matter of Barriers and a Proposal on the Origin of Organ Specificity"" (from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893834/ )

So in short, you may first need to clear out a chronic brain infection (without antibiotics, those wreck your gut flora,) then restore your gut / brain axis to fighting form with good digestion, and your brain will be pretty close to normal after that.

Don't try anything untoward without getting doctor clearance first (I pitched the idea of potassium iodide to my pdoc and he didn't have any particular worries about it, but it *can* raise heart rate, so a heart rate monitor would help to make sure nothing's out of whack.)

"I thought about it and got emotional. That there could be a place with no schizophrenia. No delusions, no hallucinations, no more meds, no more pain, and trauma and PTSD. I don't want to hurry along any one's death. We all have our time. But maybe there is a place where our spirits can finally rest easy. 

I know I am lucky as my meds work really well but I have lasting scars from psychosis. We all do. I was locked in solitary for 3 months with voices telling me I was in hell. That I would be tortured and not die. That I had dragged love ones to hell with me. I begged to take their place as I heard them tortured because of me. The voices told me god turned their back on me. That no one had ever loved me and I would be here forever. 

At one point, I told the guards I was anxious and they came in and stripped me naked. Took my bed. Even took my glasses subjecting me to constant headaches. All I had was a suicide suit (I wasn't suicidal). They left me like that for about a month. Idk. I lost track of time. 

My point is that real life horror movie trauma we go through doesn't just go away. It's always there. Lurking. We've been through bad stuff and I just hope maybe there is a place for us where we are free from the pain. All religions, all atheists. That God takes pity on us for a life of struggle. Incidentally I don't believe god is male or female or any silly human ideas. I also don't follow any set religion. 

I'm not sure if this resonates with anyone and maybe it's all bullshit. Idk. But maybe just maybe after we leave this world there is a place where we are forgiven for what we did while sick. Where we are no longer haunted by visions and voices and trauma and ghosts and nonsense.

"I am a 19 year old boy currently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD. I had an psychosis around January this year for about 2 months and started going on antipsychotics(olanzapin?) and so on. The investigation for a psychotic disorder got closed because I tested positive for amfetamine. I dont use amfetamine, the only reason was because I tried adhd medicine as a response to my suspicions before my adhd diagnosis. 
 I've been getting small hallucinations ever since now and then but nothing noticeable to the point that I am fully aware. 
Now here is the catch, for the last 2 weeks my room is getting attacked by spiders (6-10 every day). Naive as I am I go on a killing streak as soon as I see one. But there is something strange about the spiders, like they look different or something. I've been getting this feeling of hair on my body especially in my face, feelings of bugs either landing or crawling on my skin (each 5-10 minute passing by).
My friends have pointed out that I can randomly say something then answer it immediately. An example is when my girlfriend and I laid in my bed, I stood up and asked â€œwhere is the other pillow?â€ And 1 second after I said â€œit's thereâ€ while pointing to a part of the room my back is facing. A very common thing the last weeks is me saying something then immediately after asking myself â€œwtf did I just sayâ€ while having the feeling not controlling my actions.

"Hey all,   
I'm looking for some perspective. My partner has schizophrenia, we've been together a little over two years. He's dancing on the verge of his 7th psychosis, and it's the first one that I've been around for. He's always been an incredible, loving, supportive partner, but I know that his past is quite dark.   
We're having a really rough go. He has this belief that he is unloveable and unhelpable. Every time that I try to take self-care space, he goes into a loneliness spiral and accuses me of rejecting him. 

He's become quite abusive - gaslighting, emotionally blackmailing, calling me horrible names and shaming and blaming me for things that he perceived as me hurting him (like trying to take self-care space). I know that he is in an immense amount of pain and suffering right now, he feels incredibly lonely, ashamed, and his self-worth is in the pits. 

I am giving everything I can, but he's convinced that I'm the enemy, so every act of love becomes misconstrued. 

Breaking up is not an option. I love him and I know who he is underneath of this. 

Looking for insight, especially if you have schizophrenia... what would you want someone to do/say in times like this?   
Also, tips for setting healthy boundaries in these situations? 

He has pretty bad agoraphobia rn, so tips on how to tackle that with him would be awesome as well.

Hi, r/schizophrenia. I am 26 years old and recently got a schizophrenia diagnosis after hearing voices and having delusions almost my whole life.

I am on Zyprexa and have been using it for 2 years now, and it has really helped with the voices and the delusions. 
The voices are still there but they are less demanding/scary.

I was hospitalized one month ago because the voices was telling me i had to take my own life. When i got out i did not feel any better. The voices was still there, and they where telling me to jump in front of a train that same week i got out.

I told my doctor and he prescribed me Seroquel. About an hour after taking my first dose the voices was completely gone, and have been ever since. Also i am much calmer, sleep better and no longer emotionally eating.

I finally feel like myself again.

If you have any questions feel free to ask but i wont be discussing dosages.

It has caused me so much extra stress I am starting to question if it's even worth it anymore. Even though I am hourly they kept my salary rate, so I am being compensated well for the hours I do work, but that doesn't include travel time and everything I have to do in order to get to work on time let alone trying to manage the support I have filed for and getting ready to go back to school.

"TW reassurance seeking delusions

I have OCD and I feel like I will be sent to hell if I don't do a compulsion and there is a person in my brain who is saying this but it's just my thoughts? Like I'll respond to myself and feel like I didn't actually respond and feel like It was someone else. I'll hear random thoughts that respond to me and I can't tell if it's an actual voice I hear or a thought and I am subconsciously responding to myself. I literally can not tell. They get more prominent when I lay down and get sleeping so I think it's a sign it's a voice.

"I don't have the illness myself, but my mother does (she has paranoid schizophrenia) and I really need some help here. She's had (TW) two suicide attempts + one mild overdose (the attempts happened back in 2018/19, the mild overdose last summer). She's been inpatient like 6 times over the years, but the hospital stays never have a lasting affect on her. After a few months she stops taking her meds ands all her symptoms intensify (although she says she still ""sees the signs"" when she's on a high dose). I do not live with her, I'm an adult myself. She lives with her unhelpful significant other most of the year, but in the summer she's mostly on her own as she lives seperately in a vacation flat to reduce commute. All this makes it awfully hard, in fact, impossible for me to make sure she takes her meds.   


She is, unfortunately due to her illness, very distrustful, and barely tells anything to her psyh with whom she meets like once in 3-4 months.  
This 2021/22 period is especially hard for her as my sister (her daughter) was diagnosed with cancer last year and her father (my grandpa) passed away less than 2 months ago.  
The last few weeks she's been really unwell as I heard it on the phone, she's been dealing with suicidal thoughts, thoughts of giving up, not having the strength to continue. I wish I could just get her to the hospital somehow as every single day I am scared to death she will do something to herself. But, she won't go and if I talk to her psych or the hospital behind her back she will never trust me again. She's been changing her meds on her own and I know this is dangerous by itself, but I feel like I cannot do anything about it. She also has a huge stock of meds at home from all those years of not taking them consistently, which is really worrying... I told her to take them to the pharmacy but that didn't happen. Lately she's even been expressing guilt after talking to me on the phone, even though I genuinely want to help her and I'm happy to listen to her worries. She even said her anxiety increased after talking to me because she felt guilty for being a ""burden"" on me.  
If you have any advice in this situation (whether you're a person with schizophrenia or a loved one) I am open to anything, or even just a perspective other than my own on this situation would be really helpful.",Schizophrenia
"i'm honestly confused

i have hallucinations (visual, tactile, some auditory), thought blocking and other thought issues, lack of motivation, apathy, internal voices, paranoia. but no delusions, just odd beliefs likely stemming from magical thinking. but never getting to a point of full belief, more like ""here's a thought for you, you can let it go but you could also start worrying about it making it scary"". but i don't really play into it much.

when i was out in public and my voices told me ""They want me dead"" (they're internal voices, sometimes disguising as my own thoughts). i wanted to get home as quickly as possible because i was paranoid. as i am paranoid, about cameras and such. but not to a delusional extent if you ask me. i check rooms and always behave as if im being filmed because i think it's very likely. but i don't think it qualifies as a delusion.

although for most of the things that i have named, it has recently been the first time experiencing them in my life. it's new to me, i don't know what will happen in the future, if it will be better or worse. because i've only noticed issues since february. i thought the voices were intrusive thoughts until i realised intrusive thoughts don't have personalities etc. the voices were there for a bit longer, maybe somewhere end of last year.

maybe somebody in this subreddit knows more about it? or has had the same thing happen. i read one thing that said 2.5% of people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders had hallucinations without delusions from the test group.

&gt;A total of 346 (82%) had experienced both hallucinations and delusion, 63 (15%) had experienced delusions without hallucinations, 10 (2.5%) had experienced hallucinations without delusions and 2 patients (0.5%) had neither but experienced negative and severely disorganized symptoms.

They are to find a path that keeps moving the fandom forward, rather than in circles.

"Hello, I have been diagnosed as schizoaffective since 2019. I take Abilify 20mg daily and have been since then.

&amp;#x200B;

I have suspected for a long time that I suffer from ADHD; I am almost 100% certain I suffer from it and suspect that I have family members who do too. Reflecting back on my past, my symptoms and issues would flare up during certain times of my life and the severity would fluctuate, and right now, it is the worst it has ever been. I've never spoke to a medical professional about focusing/concentration issues or ADHD-related issues, so I was wondering if I do get diagnosed with this, what kind of treatments could my psychiatrist put me on?

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are stimulant medications that treat ADHD, but this can be complicated for patients suffering from psychotic disorders as these meds can exacerbate their symptoms. However, I've read online that some schizophrenia (and related disorders) patients can handle them, and some doctors are fine with this. But what if a doctor thinks it's a bad idea. There are clearly people out there who suffer from ADHD and psychotic disorders, so how do they get both of them treated at once?

Anyway i just try to think reasonably and that leads me to how i want to fix the problem and i am experiencing the stress and anxiety so there must be some trigers, so is it best to try to find the trigers and think how to cope with them, or even eliminate them, instead of just having to take randomly antidepressants.

"The title says it all. 

I don't understand how I could have a continuous auditory hallucination (usually just static in my right ear) without being paranoid or delusional in the slightest. I feel as if my strange thoughts are transient and mild; just simply not debilitating. If this stayed the same my entire life, I don't see how it is debilitating (outside of the 3 month recovery after an episode). Studies I find say that only 10% have a progressive course, so I don't think things could get bad. Even my doctor became skeptical that it is something on the schizophrenia spectrum due to the, ""delusional insight"". 

Does anyone else just not get delusions? I feel as if I can't be the only one because my case is nothing special.",Schizophrenia

I feel like people online are up to something. I keep seeing people slurp food in a disgustingly sensual manner, saying â€œoofâ€, etc. Personally I don't know where these gestures are coming from but I feel like I didn't give my heart away to anyone. I also don't want people to force me to love a certain person who I'd like to avoid right now. I also feel like I want to have an honest discussion that would better help me better understand what's going on, but instead I feel like I just get blamed for not feeling the same thing as everyone else.

Like more and more of my behavior and thoughts are produced by my unconscious. I think my troubles sleeping stem from this as well, I think it's a part of my schizophrenia. Like my leg will just build up an uncomfortable feeling until I move it or it moves without me trying to.

I am not sure if I am explaining this in a way that makes sense but basically I am becoming aware of a bunch of things happening in my body, and urges I get to do things, and unconscious thoughts and movements. It's like dissociation but with my whole body but I don't think I am wrong about it.

"I met someone \[M/26\] in January who was (is?) a really awesome and intelligent person. He is multilingual, his faith is important to him and he invited me to his church, and he comes from a large creative family. The more I got to know him, the more I realized he seemed to be having problems keeping a job. He changed jobs 3 or 4 times since January. He also always seemed to have an unstable living situation. He was initially living with parents, then his brother, then his cousin, but he never really had money and after he didn't pay them rent, he was kicked out. He was not good about helping with chores and cleaning and would sometimes accidentally break things in their house.   


One night in March, we were having dinner together in my kitchen, and he showed me a bottle of olanzapine. He said that he didn't think he needed to take it and that his doctor was probably racist against him (he is Native American) and other things which I now recognize were probably along the lines of a persecutory delusion. Me not really realizing at the time he actually had schizophrenia, and I had also been taking a justice class that semester in college which focused on injustices against Native people, I agreed with him and said he probably didn't need to take it. Apparently, he went off his meds cold turkey then.   


Recently in May (this month) he had what I would describe as a psychotic breakdown. He started acting bizarre during social gatherings. He stole my phone from me and recorded a video on it about how he was a Prophet of God and God had spoken to him and told him to talk to me. He wouldn't leave me alone and started going to my house at odd times, banging on the door late at night and leaving long notes that didn't really make sense and were like long ranting poems. He wouldn't stop coming to my house even after I asked him, and I eventually put in a restraining order for him.   


The next time he came to my house, the police arrested him and took him away in handcuffs. The next day when he was released from jail, he walked on foot back to my house. I called the police and he was arrested again. I noticed he was posting photos on Facebook which appeared to be in this park downtown in our city where a lot of homeless people sleep. I tried to contact him on his phone and he answered. He said his phone screen had been smashed and it was difficult for him to make calls unless he used Siri.  


Last night I talked to him on the phone and convinced him to go find his car, which he had parked awhile ago in front of an abandoned building. He hadn't had money to pay for gas and he had lost his car keys. A window was broken on his car and he was able to get inside. I convinced him to sleep in his car instead of sleeping in the park where a lot of other homeless people sleep.       


I feel really guilty about the situation because I didn't realize my friend really had schizophrenia and I agreed with him when he wanted to go off his meds. It's summer now, but we live in an arctic climate and if he is still homeless when winter comes, he could freeze to death. I want to help him, but last night when I talked to him, he still wouldn't recognize he had schizophrenia and kept saying he was chosen by God to be a Prophet and God speaks to him (auditory hallucinations).   


I've been talking to some of his family, but none of them have much extra money and they all seem really tired of dealing with him. Can I help him get into some sort of shelter or rehab program? It would need to be free as I'm a student and he doesn't have any money.   


Tldr: Recently discovered my friend has schizophrenia. He went off his meds and is now homeless. Wondering how I can help.",Schizophrenia

"(description of delusion) 

hi, my name is quinn and i have very recently been diagnosed with schizoaffective type bipolar disorder. i was in psychosis for two weeks and finally i'm out of it, but while in psychosis i had a delusion me and a boy in my class where in a borderline abusive relationship and i had told my best friend about. the boy caught wind of it and, since we where clearly not in this relationship, was rather confused and confronted administration, but by the time they caught my delusion i could barely remember it and was in an extremely confused state. 

there's a lot more details about it i could share, but the boy, administration, or even my own schizophrenia is not what i'm worried about, i'm worried about my best friend. she hasn't texted me since it happened. i posted on my close friends story on instagram a few days later explaining what happened to me in psychosis and that i wasn't lying, i did believe it, and that i was so sorry to the boy and the other people i hurt, and that i will be getting better now that the issue was addressed. she didn't reply to that but she saw it. maybe it's my anxiety getting the best of me, but i'm so worried she won't be my best friend anymore because of what happened. she hasn't unfollowed my spam or untagged me from anything, but she hasn't talked to me. i think she might've taken me off her close friends story. 

we have been best friends since we where 12 and we have done everything together. i tell her everything and she tells me everything. for an entire summer we called for hours everyday playing on a minecraft world where we lived on an island. we have plans to travel the country together, to make a youtube channel and steam together, we even dated for a week. she is my platonic soulmate and if there was nobody else in the world, as long as she was there i would be just fine. i didn't think it was possible to miss someone this much. i'm afraid to reach out to her because i don't want to experience it going south, but what if she's afraid of reaching out to me? 

i understand there is going to be a trust issue now, but i will work through that. i will do anything for her. i have no idea what to do. i just want her back and i'm so scared. what do i do???",Schizophrenia

"
I'm just gonna give examples on why I think this. He's super paranoid every time we are round each other and he's always telling me how he thinks people can hear his thoughts and they respond to what he thinks. I told him that people can't hear his thoughts but I feel like he didn't believe me. He's feels like every car that passes is watching him or after him. He came over my house because he's staying with someone right now and he was telling me about how the neighbors next door keep talking about him and threatening his life. When he came over my house he said he felt like he was being monitored. Every place he goes to it's the same thing. 

I stayed with him one night at his old apt after he smoked weed and it was a scary sight. He was laying next to me and mumbling under his breath. Telling me how he gets no privacy and that everyone lacks principles. He started to yell things like â€œshut upâ€ to no one and was just getting really frustrated. He said he was just sleep talking but he wasn't asleep. I told him I think he's experiencing something that's gonna need medical attention and he said I was calling him crazy and that he's been like this his whole life. He basically just blew me off. I asked him if he heard voices talking to him and he said yes his neighbors were. I didn't hear anything while I was there. Complete silence besides some bangs on the wall from his neighbors. After I told him I didn't hear anything he just blew it off and said his hearing is better than mine. 

He just keeps telling me he can hear people from far away and it's like he's not comprehending how crazy it sounds. He's gone three days without sleep. I've been trying to do things to make sure he feels better and gets sleep but nothing is getting better. 


The thing is he's always been a paranoid person but never to this extent. It's interfering with our relationship now. All he talks about now is these things and I'm so sad and worried because he won't get help. What if this messes him up? I don't know what to do I feel hopeless I don't want anything to happen to him. How do you help someone who won't get help or feel that they need it? I told him I think he should stop smoking weed cause it can cause psychosis but he didn't listen to me. He's been smoking his whole life so of course I knew it wouldn't be that easy.

"I'm Andrew. I'm new here. I'm 32 years old and I've had schizoaffective disorder since 2013. I've been misdiagnosed a couple of times, but I've landed at schizoaffective because of my sometimes volatile emotional nature. I'm well under control now living with my parents with a certain amount of independence to go and make friends in town. It's a small town, but you start to see the same people twice and it's kind of nice. Anyway, I am well educated. I have a master's degree in music performance and I've been an oboe player for over 20 years now. Not too shabby of one either haha. I also compose music and improvise on piano. I've also been diagnosed on the high-functioning autism spectrum. But yeah I'm really looking forward to joining this group! I've moderately successfully made friends and I've navigated the huge hurdles this disease throws at you, mainly the endless hallucinations and paranoia. I hope I can contribute in a positive way, I've been going to therapy for 8 years and know a lot of tools that get me out of jams. But I'm not invincible. I still have breakdowns, shutdowns, some addictive tendencies...but that's life. Do what you can with what you've got. Anyway, hello!",Schizophrenia
" To preface, this was a post I made on my Facebook describing my condition to my closest friends. It would be difficult to alter so I'll just show it here. Hopefully, I can find people in this sub that feel the same way or struggle with the same things I do on a daily basis. For the record, it was very well received and I highly encourage others like me to share their experience with those you trust.

&amp;#x200B;

....

&amp;#x200B;

This post is about something I have been encouraged by my therapist to share. Not with everyone, we decided, but with you all. 

I don't know how to say exactly what I want to say but this is how I'll start. I'm a little scared, to be honest. I think it is because I don't want to reveal or be vulnerable about something much deeper than anxiety or depression, that only a few people outside my family know. It's like if I say it my world will end, and everyone I know will back away. Paranoia is such a big problem for me.

I suffer from the disorder known as schizophrenia. And I have for many years. For me it manifests as, among other things, auditory hallucinations of voices. Voices that are not real, and almost never the same person. Sometimes one, other times 3 or 5. These are not friendly voices though. They are degrading voices, that I try to ignore or drown out just to get through the day. At times they act like a person leaning over your shoulder, critiquing your every move. Other times, they are shouting and become hard to ignore. Thankfully at this point, I know they are not real when I hear them because I am alone in my house. But when I lived in apartments with neighbors, there was no way to know if what I was hearing was real or not (reality checking). Because along with the schizophrenia, I lost the ability to tell what's in my head from what is imaginary. 

I rarely hear my own voice in my head. Without the voices, sometimes I hear nothing at all. The voices sort of narrate my life, responding to things I say or do, but in a very critical and mocking way. And it's irrational sometimes, where the voices physically come from, like hearing them in the car or sometimes even outdoors. But that doesn't stop them from harassing me to no end and I dread hearing them when I am alone. Sometimes they go on for hours, continuous sentences that somehow form in my head, as if there was a script pre-written, and are transformed into audible speaking, or even yelling.  Maybe they were always there, they just transformed into people instead of thoughts. Hard to know, but that's been the part of the journey is understanding what is happening in my head in a tangible way. 

To be honest, the experience of hearing these voices is at times simply terrifying. They wreak havoc on my life, killing my self-esteem, and creating unbelievable anxiety which feeds the paranoia that makes me feel at the very least that I am not safe. The isolation and living alone during the pandemic exasperated that feeling immensely.

And then there's the medications I take. At the worst maybe 3 years ago I took 8-9 different meds a day. I now take 5. Not great, but getting closer to feeling normal, or at least like myself. Because some of them were heavy-duty, and I walked and talked slower, living with brain fog and lack of feeling, not really feeling real or present. Unfortunately, there is one medication I take to treat long-term side effects caused by the anti-psychotic medication (schizophrenia is a type of psychosis) I have taken for years. After long-term use, it is now causing neurological symptoms creating tremor in my hands, muscle spasms or â€œjerksâ€ similar to Parkinsonism that affect my whole body when I am lying down trying to sleep. The medication I take to relieve this also creates problems like blurred vision, and forgetfulness and some visual hallucinations. Very irritating. In fact, some of the reactions I had to medication I had to go to the ER to stabilize and recover. These medications also cause and aggravate insomnia and other sleep disorders. For many years I had lucid dreams and nightmares and as a result, frequent night sweats. Fortunately, those have subsided as my stress levels have receded significantly in the last year or so. 

Schizophrenia is not something I can get away from, and there is no cure. Earlier on in my diagnosis, the hallucinations came and went for months at a time. But now it is every day, usually at night. Over time, I have learned to live with them, in spite of their existence. 

With schizophrenia, there is the positive and negative symptoms, or polar opposites. â€œPositiveâ€ being the severe anxiety, delusions, paranoia, and hallucinations. The â€œnegativeâ€ is the flat affect, numbness and clinical depression. It surrounds me every day and it makes it very difficult to concentrate at times, forcing me to attempt to drown out the voices with music, or even as a last resort, confront the voices. But they just don't shut up. Sometimes I literally vocalize for them to â€˜shut up' or â€˜leave me alone'.   
At one point, I learned or created â€˜reality checks' that I use to determine if the voices are real or not, which with my strong perceptive ability I have been able at the highest times of crisis to defuse the voice that at that time sounded remarkably real. My only way to avoid tangible consequences as a result of my condition has been to not â€œreactâ€ to what I am hearing, such as banging on the wall or shouting back, no matter how convincing they are. In this way, I've been able to keep it a secret from my neighbors. At least I think so. It aggressively feeds on internal doubt, or ambiguity, and the voices use that to harass me. It's a very unpleasant experience that sometimes lasts for hours.

With schizophrenia there is also the flat affect, the lack of eye contact, odd facial expressions, and finally odd behavior and â€œword saladâ€. I've previously talked about the feeling of dissociation from myself and my feelings. Dissociation has caused me great difficulty over the years preventing me from being authentic and be myself. So because of this condition, my physical or facial response is often no response at all. 

If I was to guess, I'm sure some of you have thought or noticed something was off about me. Maybe not. But back then, I was not myself, in every sense of the word. I have had to â€œactâ€ out my daily life, taking cues from people around me, and by the very nature of acting and not being genuine, people sense I am uncomfortable and drift away from me, because I'm not very good at putting on a different persona, or identity. To make things worse, I sometimes misinterpret what people say or worse, worry that I am doing something strange or looking strange. And there's also this overall feeling of trying too hard. To socialize, to fit in, anything social really. There's a lot of paranoia involved that goes beyond normal levels, that gives my voices â€˜ammo' for attacking me later for something I said or did. My understanding is this happens normally. But instead of a critical self-monologue after the incident, I get critical voices.

Schizophrenia has been a highly misunderstood disease for as long as it's been a diagnosis. It can be genetic, or activated in combination with environmental factors, such as smoking marijuana or other psychedelics. Studies show the use of mind-altering substances increases the risk of permanent psychosis.   
Schizophrenia carries a harsh stigma that is associated with violence and confusion, awkward involuntary movements and jumbled speaking, and even violent crime. Some movies and books have attempted to portray the plight of the disease to normalize it, with some success. Delusional thinking is a hallmark of the disease, presenting as paranoia, suspiciousness, and forming bizarre conspiracy theories. But there are so many different features to the disease that not everybody with schizophrenia experiences the same way. With schizoaffective disorder (my diagnosis), the most common types of psychosis are delusions and auditory hallucinations. In my case, the voices are talking about me, to me, or some combination of the two. Someone else with psychosis may have more mild narration, or hear music. Either way, my medication mostly keeps both of these in check. And really, I've reached a point of â€˜good enough' with my medication cocktail, weighing the costs and benefits of their side effects.

Truthfully, I didn't used to be so open about my illness, or anything at all. I was very quiet and reserved before, as a perceived need for my self-preservation. And I didn't used to have the â€œcharismaâ€ that I display at times. The good news is over the last year I've been able to be the most like myself because of the routine I've gotten into every day, or most days. And the QoL improvements can be attributed to the effectiveness of the medications I take. Because of those things, I've been able to live a somewhat normal life.

So that's the long and short of it. I have had a diagnosis of schizophrenia since 2013, and I would say it began a couple years before that undiagnosed. Most cases in males start at age 20-25, which puts me squarely in college, making bizarre claims and farfetched theories about certain people and things. My diagnosis is technically schizoaffective disorder, which is a type of bipolar with psychosis as a secondary syndrome. To this day, I have been on at least 15 different medications, all treating different things, and causing sometimes very strange side effects.

So this is my life. What it's really like. I've lived in fear of revealing this delicate but all-encompassing part of my life story. I'm not sure why. But I have been very lucky to have access to effective treatment and medication, that many don't have access to. And I have learned many therapeutic tools and concepts that give me more clarity and help me face new challenges along the way with an informed mind. And of course, I have friends who have supported me through the worst of it. 

I've been encouraged by my counselor and others to become a mental health advocate for those with mental illnesses like anxiety, depression, bipolar, and especially schizophrenia. But I'm not an expert, so I'm a little wary. I can effectively bring my knowledge and experience to the table, and I hope to be courageous enough to talk about it in a public setting both to educate and to share my experience. Public speaking is not really my thing, but I would try to do my best. I feel like I have a good understanding of schizophrenia, but each person's experience is different.

Thank you for reading this very long story. It wasn't easy to say, but I hope it was educational and answered some questions about schizophrenia, about me, and about what I go through. I wasn't intending it to be so long and somewhat informational, but I've written it so no point in changing it. For those of you who stayed friends with me over the years despite my various conditions, thank you for being there for me. Your support doesn't go unnoticed, particularly when I was at my lowest points along the way. You've made a huge difference in my life, and I hope we can stay friends after what I've said here.

Thank you for your friendship and support. I know I'm quirky and awkward and well, now you know why. I want to try and embrace that rather than be ashamed of it.",Schizophrenia

When experiencing a psychotic episode, a person with schizophrenia may experience an abrupt shift in personality and behavior. wherein the world could look unclear and ideas, pictures, and sounds might seem disorganized.

**Treating Schizophrenia:**

â€œThe first challenge to treating Schizophrenia is helping the individuals understand that they are fighting the disorder. This is called developing insight. Most treatment begins after insight is developed,â€ reflects Dr. Arun, Consultant Psychiatrist, Cadabams Group.

Schizophrenia is a chronic illness, and those who have it frequently need ongoing support throughout their lives. Both medicine and counseling are used to treat schizophrenia. When a violent psychotic episode occurs and the patient is at risk of harming themselves or those around them, caregivers for people with schizophrenia consent to the patient's supported admission for treatment at a hospital or clinic.

**Medication for Schizophrenia**

A popular kind of treatment for schizophrenia is an antipsychotic medication. Antipsychotic medication therapy aims to successfully manage signs and symptoms at the lowest dose achievable. The drug can be taken orally or intravenously.

**Oral medication**  
First Generation Antipsychotic medications are cheaper medications in the long run but have significant neurological side effects on the body. Second-generation antipsychotic medications such as Aripiprazole (Abilify), Asenapine (Saphris), Brexpiprazole (Rexulti), and Cariprazine (Vraylar) are thus widely used due to their lower risk of side effects. Because medications for Schizophrenia can cause serious side effects, people with schizophrenia may be reluctant to take them. Willingness to cooperate with treatment may affect drug choice. For instance, someone resistant to taking medication in time may need injections instead of taking a pill.Â 

**Injectable Antipsychotics**

Antipsychotics can be injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Depending on the drug, they are often administered every two to four weeks. This may be an option if someone would rather take fewer tablets and may aid in adherence if the person is unable to take their medications according to the suggested schedule.

## Therapy for SchizophreniaÂ 

While many psychosocial treatments can help with the behavioral, psychological, and social dysfunctions associated with schizophrenia, medicine aids in the relief of its symptoms. People with schizophrenia can learn to control their symptoms, recognize early relapse warning signals, and create a relapse prevention strategy through therapy.

### Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).

**â€**A person can alter their thinking and behavior with the aid of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Delusions and hallucinations are frequent signs of schizophrenia, and they can make a person feel detached from reality. People with schizophrenia can recognize their loss of control as a sign of schizophrenia rather than the paranoia of hearing and seeing things with the help of CBT sessions and medication. Through therapy, one is able to pinpoint the causes of psychotic episodes and learn ways to stop or lessen them.

**Family counseling.**

Family members frequently serve as a person with schizophrenia's primary caregiver and source of support. Any family may experience pressure as a result of caregiver burnout and tiredness. Caregivers may feel guilty for taking time off for themselves or for being abandoned by a loved one who needs treatment for schizophrenia. Family therapy can help the caregiver and the patient deal with the disease more effectively. It requires several meetings spread out over around six months.

Chronic schizophrenia has a significant negative impact on a person's capacity for daily living. Although there is no known cure for schizophrenia, there are numerous treatments available to assist people to manage their symptoms. The assistance of their family, friends, and local services is extremely beneficial to those with schizophrenia. They gain from medication and medical care and are able to recover from this condition.",Schizophrenia

"Hello! I (F28) have a friend (M36) who spent more than 8 years without looking at himself in the mirror. He's slowly getting back to look at himself and now even takes pictures and have social media profiles, very good progress I believe. 

I know him since I was six years old, he was my brother's best friend and at some point he started isolating himself some days of the week, throughout the years he became very difficult to reach out to the point where we completely lost touch.

He knowledges he is schizophrenic, we talk with each other every once in a while. He seems to have his ups and downs and I'm trying the best I can to be supportive. 

I know he was bullied in school, the bullies would tell him he looked like indigenous or Mexican to try to get him to feel offended, that somehow remained with him and for the longest time he'd look in the mirror and se an Indian Or a Mexican instead of himself. What's the hardest thing about this whole background is that he's constantly sending me pics asking for reassurance regarding his skin color, he does not want to look brown, he tries at any cost to deny the possibility of him having any connection with those races.

I tried telling him that he needs to accept his own color and feature the way it is, I tried very hard many times to get him to realize that he does not have to be afraid of looking certain way.

"Hi , I'm starting to realize that even some of the most religious people I know , that God does not truly speak to them. 
When I ask if God has spoken to you, I do not mean through someone else , but I mean speaking directly to you by Him, Himself.
I am wondering if anyone here has heard God speak to them audibly, or in other ways such a dreams , visions , nightmares, meditation or even through prayer?
Where you ask a question and you get an immediate answer?
If a person does hear God and God has talked to them and told them things through any of the ways I listed , does that make the person special or somewhat of a prophet? 
Also , if you have not experienced this ,I do not expect you to understand or believe that this happens to some people. 
Some people that this happens to are labeled schizophrenic, like myself. However , I believe that is just doctors who don't believe in God labeling us, because they don't understand or believe what we experience.

I had various periods of my life when I was 100% convinced that I had some illness.

Suffering from derealization for many years now, 2 years ago I was convinced that I was schizophrenic, then visits with psychiatrists denied my obsession, but now it's back...

And I would like to understand if mine is hypochondria or delirium.

The symptoms that make me think of schizophrenia are:

It seems that the walls or the floor were moving when I look at them for more than 2 seconds or when I lamb: as if there were a source of heat in front of my eyes.

another symptom like if I suddenly see smaller, but immediately changing the position of the eyes this feeling passes (it makes me very panic)

I don't know if this is a normal feeling or not, but when I think of someone's voice I can remember and say â€œhearâ€ the tone of voice in my mind.

The derealization magically passes in summer and returns serious in winter.

"Hey so Ive just stopped taking all my meds
1. because my mother keeps stealing them and the pharmacy thinks I'm eating them like candy and 
2. I no longer can afford them
 so now I'm struggling already and its only been a day I'm not sure what to do I've just been trying to distract myself
And it's pretty hard to distinguish the difference between real or hallucinations",Schizophrenia
"Have any of you hallucinated strange, intense machinery that has some purpose, typically malevolent? Like it is apart of a larger machine, and the machine itself is not from ""this world"", but it's operating in it. The machinery is usually tubes with complex devices and looks grungy and maybe even far fetched or primitive. Had this happen last night and the machines will move to continue working. It's almost once I take notice of them, the machines themselves get mad I'm aware and display features as though they are sentient beings. This last part is very common for all types of my hallucinations, but last night the machinery was winding in my room and was supposedly operating on my head, and there was even a bright light like it took a picture.

"The weather in my area has been so nice lately and I feel like I'm wasting every single day hiding, too afraid to go outside. I know no one is actually (tw) staring at me, stalking me or coordinating an attack against me, but of course my sz brain can't completely shake those fearsâ€”especially when I'm out in the open.

I just feel like I'm wasting my life hiding inside my apartment. I miss gardening. I miss hiking. I miss sitting by the water and reading a book. I miss feeling the breeze on my face. 

I'm sure many of you can relate. Does anyone have any tips on how to help combat these anxieties? I just want to start enjoying my life again and this seems like a good place to start.",Schizophrenia

"So, I'm moving to a care home instead of living alone finally. The place is, all in all, quite humane, though supervised washing (due to my hygiene negligence and never having been taught how) and sniff tests for a while until I'm trusted to do it alone, will suck. See how it goes I guess. See how it goes.

I thank everyone for sharing things to look out for, advice, etc. We shall see what we shall see. At least it will enrage my parents, which gives me sadistic joy.

I'm questioning bc why would people be born like this?,Schizophrenia
"I know doubts about your diagnosis or lack of insight are common among enough, , but I have very strong doubts about my so-called schizophrenia. I was diagnosed only a few years ago, already in my 40s. I don't hear voices or experience paranoia, but I did have a severe depression which brought with it a radical outlook in my worldview, a spiritual crisis if so will and, of course, very common in middle age.

 I think that initially I liked the label 'schizo', it brought me a certain freedom to pursue my interests without bowing to more everyday cares. And I also suspect i overstated my inner changes and experiences more forcefully than it was justified in order to make those changes even more real to me. Maybe there was an element of vanity in all this as well. I think I've manipulated others into accepting my narrative. In addition I've never lost insight or believed 100% my more outrageous claims, which after looking at what countless people  are discussing or even believing online don't strike me as being particularly outrageous.

For years I've suffered from severe pure o OCD, which coupled with a very active imagination could have easily concocted the whole thing.

What are your thoughts?",Schizophrenia
"I feel those of you who have experience with this topic could tell me if what im going through is related in any way.

My older brother has schizophrenia so it's in my family.

But i'm not sure if this is my weed usage causing this. Maybe PTSD from foster homes/being placed around as a kid?

I can't trust a soul, I see the fake in everybody that nobody else sees. I see the possible betrayal in everyone.  I fucking hate interactions, eye contact, I want to be in my own world 24/7 (I am self paid so this is very easy) 

I could never have a partner or true friend seeing I don't know what they're planning, or what they're thinking or intentions.

Am I just paranoid? Or are most humans just fucking blind to how fake people are.",Schizophrenia

"I've written about this in the past and I feel like I'm whining at this point, but I don't care. I need to vent. Again. And yes, this is a long post. Again.

Long story short, medication expenses are so steep for me without Medicaid in the U.S. that I've basically given up all hope of a real career. I'm in my 40's. The clock's ticking. If I'm going to do anything, the sooner the better.

In theory, if not in practice, I've been an ardent capitalist for years. I've read more self-help and success guru books that I can count, hoping to inspire myself to one day live the dream. Get a good job. Run a successful business. Get some side gigs, do some freelancing.

But it's all a fantasy. Whether do to avolition or fear, I can't motivate myself to take the necessary risks to succeed at anything. And I'm giving up hope.

For those who are familiar with disability payments in the U.S., I'm on SSI, not SSDI. Pathetic as it is, I probably don't even qualify for SSDI because I lack the necessary work credits. In my freaking 40's. That's how little I've worked in my adult life.

Over the past few months, the extent of my ambition has been to perhaps work long enough to qualify for SSDI and maybe increase the amount of money I get every month. Also, resource limits for SSDI are far less restrictive than SSI, and even if you lose Medicaid you still qualify for Medicare. It might actually pay to work and save money and build a nest egg, even if it's not much. Right now, I have to spend almost everything I make just to qualify for benefits. When I'm actually making money, that is.

That's it. That's all I really have to look forward to. Working shit jobs below my actual abilities just to qualify for a slight improvement in my financial situation. No grand dream, no grand ambition, nothing that I can take real pride in.

I don't know what I expect anyone to say. Maybe commiseration with the fact that my ambition is on its last legs, and I don't know how much hope I can summon. The loss of the dream of financial success has left me with nothing big to hope for in life. Now it's shit jobs and disability payments till I die. Just existing. I'm struggling with that, knowing that's all my life has turned out to be.

But maybe it's whining. The truth is, despite my prior capitalist leanings, I don't care much about all of the trappings of financial success. I don't care about fancy houses or cars or big TVs or any of that. I'm asexual, so I don't feel the need to impress some woman just to get laid and feel validated. I have intense asociality, and I don't feel the need to impress lots of friends or climb any big social ladders. I don't even know what I'm really losing by watching my dreams die. I don't want much more than I actually have. I've just been taught to *want* things, to consider ambition for ambition's sake a virtue. I've valued the *idea* of the struggle so highly for so long that losing it steals my momentum in life, and I feel like I've just crashed.

I guess I find myself saying to myself, ""So you've finally realized you're all that, you'll never be all that, you're nothing special and you'll never accomplish anything big in life. Deal with it."" And so I'm struggling to deal with it, and it sucks.",Schizophrenia
"Sometimes I think I'm depressed, but it turns out I'm just tired. Sometimes I think I'm ""happy"", but I'm actually depressed. Sometimes I have psychosis, but I think I'm just ""inspired"". It's like my brain can't properly label anything.

"On mobile sorry for formatting. 

My younger BIL was diagnosed with schizophrenia about 1.5 years ago, which was the 1st hospitalization. He started the monthly injection after that. He later lied about getting his April 2022 injection. He eventually got it but soon after he had the episode and then was forced back to the hospital for the second time. Emphasis on forced. His psychiatrist made the call. 

The mistake of our part as the family support was not educating ourselves early on. Even though he is an adult, he went back home. Alone in the basement of his mother's house. We thought he was getting better this whole time. We realized that wasn't the case about 6 weeks ago. It took him being hospitalized (4 weeks ago) for us to realize that his mom, my MIL, is a narcissist and she still enables him. 

He was in the hospital for 3 weeks. New pill medication and also monthly injection. He went back home with his mom. We recently went over there and talked to him that we are worried about him and we want to avoid the hospital. Even though episodes happen, let's get the necessary support started so we can learn more and how he can be a member of society again. He doesn't have a routine or responsibilities even around the house like dishes or trash while living with his mom. During our talk, he told us what we wanted to hear. Therapy was supposed to start on Monday and he refused to go. He kept telling my husband, â€œdon't worry about me. Worry about yourselfâ€ 

I keep saying we, but we is his two brothers, my husband and older BIL, older BIL's wife, and me. We didn't think he should go home to his mom. Nothing will get better there. MIL is playing the hero and the victim with his care.

We are worried about him. We are scared that he will get lost in the mental health system by refusing to get help. We are scared he could hurt himself or someone else because why he was hospitalized was due to the recording my husband had of the things he said during his episode. 

I understand that at the end of the day, we cannot help someone who won't help themselvesâ€¦ 
We can't force him to do anything he doesn't want to. Is there anything that we should say or do to show we care and are truly there for him even though he is having serious trust issues due to his schizophrenia?",Schizophrenia
"Diagnosed with schizophrenia last Friday starting antipsychotics this Friday. Current mental diagnosis (PTSD, personality disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, panic disorder) started back in therapy but was told i needed revaluation for all diagnosis. She said i have antisocial behaviors and i dont know what she meant by that. 

But i only started have hallucinations 3 months ago tactile,auditory,and visual. Thats what made me finally get back into therapy and suicidal ideation. Then she started talking about delusions and i never realized which i mean thats the point of delusions i guess. She started asking about self isolation and i told her i started self isolating 2 years ago when i moved for college. Then I dropped out due to mental issues. 

But my question is this how bad does this actually get? I knew i had the risks my biological mother had it and i already had trauma and so many other disorders. Does this coincide with the other mental disorders? And are my psychotic breaks going to be different as the schizophrenia gets worse?",Schizophrenia
"What do you think about a different normal? We do not have to replace anyone else's normal to have that. We have a different perspective. We see things differently and feel things differently. Having a normal that works for us is a powerful way to motivate people like us (or like anyone) to have confidence in themselves and find their potential and power. We know this is true because there are so many ""normal"" people in this world who live happy and fulfilled lives. They party they work they play and they spend time with family. Normal is just a path to walk that we know leads to productive things. If we achieve a normal for people like us I think we can unlock our potential and become a powerful presence in society.

"Currently, I am living at home, and I am in constant conflict with my family members. They are loud, and noise is exhausting for me. I need some silence and some time to ""organize"" my mind. But I can't do that as long as I live at home. My sibling is manipulative and callous, playing with my mind on a daily basis and saying things to make me feel bad, purely out of spite. My father treats this sibling like a God. For example, I have been hit many times hard enough to leave a red blister, and my father will tell them to stop. But if I so much as tell them I need to use the shower, my father will berate me, threaten me, etc. I am constantly being told things. My father has a severe anxiety disorder which is untreated. Anything I try to do, from taking a trip to having a relationship, he says will fail and tells me I need to just (do x instead), which is always the opposite. He contradicts himself.

As a result, I have come to the conclusion that I *must* move out and become as independent as possible. I need to work. I have no other alternative. If I get really bad, well I just have to keep working. I don't know how to get disability or even if it would help me, AND I'm a student and was told that I can't get disability if I'm pursuing other careers. I don't want to deal with people because my brain has no border and when I talk to people their thoughts spill into mine and I think in their minds. Also, my identity is too fragmented. I also don't want to be too bored because then I have increasingly more obvious anxiety. 

Does anyone have recommendations for types of jobs I can look for? I am ok with trying to get certified. I am a full-time student, and struggle to work and go to school at the same time. But the work I was doing was retail, which I find extremely difficult. Jobs I've considered include something with vending machines, delivery, security, or door dash. I am considering relocating to somewhere more affordable to live as well. But I need to learn skills such as budgeting and cooking, which I don't currently know.",Schizophrenia

" Hi everyone. My bf was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolarity some years ago. At that time, he was fighting against drug abuse in a rehab clinic. He spends 4 years clean but then he started using again (weed) and in my opinion, it's a ""healthy"" usage. He smokes sometimes just to chill and nothing happens. So, I don't think that's a problem. 

He told me his story and told me about his diagnosis. He thinks that there are people taking photos of him, whispering or giggling about him, bumping into him. He believes that some people around us belong to a secret society and these people are trying to make him question his sanity. He rarely hears voices just saying irrelevant things, like completing his sentences. He is sure he isn't schizophrenic or bipolar. He thinks he is medium and has a kind of sensitivity. He is sure that he understands situations like everyone else. He can't go to a psychiatrist or a therapist currently because he is unemployed.

We dater for almost 7 months, so I'm pretty new with this condition. Since I knew about this, I have been questioning his interpretations, the things he thinks that happen, etc. I would like to know how can I help him and if this is really schizophrenia or if it could be paranoia.  
Thanks everyone.",Schizophrenia
"Hi everyone,
I came across this community today after my brother has been going through some mental changes the past few months. I would really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and provide any information that they can. 

Halloween of 2021, my brother (21 years old) went to a club with some people he knew. While in line, a friend passed him some marijuana and my brother had some. He's not an avid smoker, will only occasionally smoke at a party. That night, after walking out of the bar, he saw a guy getting jumped by a group of other people. He originally thought that the guy getting jumped was someone he knew, but my brother left without confirming. He became paranoid for the next few days that it was his friend, even after confirming with him that it wasn't him. From then on, my brother was convinced that someone or a group of people were after him because he was friends with this guy (again, who confirmed that nothing happened that night). This paranoia went on for weeks but eventually subsided around December 2021. From December to about a month ago, he was back to normal, but with occasional paranoia flairs. Nothing that prevented him from doing anything. 

Last month, my brother was laying on the couch and staring at a blank TV screen when the paranoia came back. He couldn't really explain it, but he said the darkness of the TV reminded him of the evening of Halloween since it was also dark. For the next few weeks he was again extremely paranoid and could barely hold conversation. His speech is extremely slowed and it's like he can't wrap his thoughts and ideas into sentences. 

Finally, this past Sunday evening he was awoken by what he thought was our neighbor (a couple) arguing extremely loudly. My dad didn't hear anything, but apparently this kept him awake the entire night. Last night, the same thing happened and my dad confirmed no sound, but not my brother is convinced that the neighbor has spying and listening into our convos and now thinks that he's going crazy. My brother wanted to call 911 for their safety because he heard the arguments getting extremely loud, but we told him not to. He now refuses to keep the window open and will not talk in the room closest to the neighbor. I believe this is now affecting his work. 

He's seen a therapist the past 2 weeks with an upcoming appointment scheduled this Thursday, but the therapist is just listening to what he's saying. My dad and I have had fully supported him this entire time, but now these voices he's hearing is obviously getting us concerned. 

We think that his cannabis use on the Halloween night led to a long term dilemma? Has anyone encountered this? Does any of this sound familiar to anyone? 

Please let me know. We just want the best for him and want him to get the care soon.",Schizophrenia

"So usually when me and my brother talk we almost immediately start talking about like consciousness and the universe and shit like that. And it's taken a dark turn before. My lil bro has some violent tendencies, but he's never acted on them, and has said that he doesn't plan to, so although it kinda freaks me out, I do my best not to judge him. he is my brother. Well yesterday we had a conversation that just irked me really deep. He asked me if I thought the world was over populated, and I said no, I think people are valuable, and have great ideas and can figure out how to do more with less. He proceeded to tell me how people take up too much space, and how ""a fat guy waiting in line for a twinkie, WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE BORN"" he said this several times with the utmost seriousness. but that's not even close to the worst of it, like I said I already knew he violent tendencies. so we're talking about consciousness and he is trying to explain his experiences to me, he says it's kind of like a blind person who was suddenly able to see, and how that vision would be extremely overwhelming for that person. He said that his experience was allot like when someone was being tickled as a child and it felt really euphoric but you also wanted the person to stop. Then he described this experience where the universe was torn in half ""like a sheet of paper"", he was like ""that shouldn't happen right"" and I didn't understand what he meant so I asked him to explain, and he said ""imagine someone put a finger in front of your face and moved it down and tore everything you saw in half like a sheet of paper"" that was creepy af to hear him describe that. He does do allot of magic mushrooms, but his violent tendencies according to him have existed since he was a young child, although I don't know if the other experiences have. he often expresses the desire to torture other people and animals, he's said that he wants the world to burn. I want him to stop doing the shrooms, but everytime I mention it he just shuts me down. He told me he had a premonition that he's going to get everything he wants, which is creepy af considering the things he wants. he my brother and I fucking love him... but what tf is this, honestly. it seems like he's trapped in some sort of cosmic eldritch horror, and wants everyone else to be there with him, so that he's not alone.",Schizophrenia

He continues to smoke (maybe 2 weeks out of month) and that only interferes with his meds ability to work. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to get someone with mental illness to stop smoking? 

He needs to understand that his smoking is causing his meds not to work the best that they could. He has been on court ordered treatment for the last years bc he is just not improving.

"It was the source of the voices and toxicity that plagued my personality, but I had no idea it had an actual origin inside my head.

One day I sort of meditated, meaning I sat relaxed and undisturbed and took a walk through my mind. I was not on any drug. After a while I discovered a locked room with some energy emanating from it. Somehow I got inside and there it was, a sort of portal from which came an unending torrent of pure evil and hate, in the form of energy and harsh voices, and rushing air. I was amazed. It was the most real thing I've experienced inside my mind, it was as physically real as anything out here in the world. I watched it for a moment and then I interacted with it somehow, and it just shut down, closing up the portal, ending the relentless stream of horror and bile. I experienced a complete calm and quiet for the first time since forever.

Since then I've been much more positive and calm, since my every waking minute isn't showered with irrational hate anymore. Voices came back after a while but were not as hostile and uncompromisingly bitter. They're almost gone now. 

This was before I was even diagnosed and medicated. So I had a lot of other stuff going on, not just voices. But I've never thought that you can do actual work inside your own mind, and I haven't had any similar experiences before or since. I wonder what really happened, and whether it is possible to perform other work related to this illness. Probably not though. I told my therapist at the time about it and asked if I had really done something of value, or if it was just imagination. He said, ""can't it be both?"". I don't know what to make of that. 

Anyway, thanks for reading this nonsense, I just wanted to tell someone who won't judge me for being weird. Would be really interesting to hear about your experiences, if any, of similar nature.",Schizophrenia

"TLDR: lol help me get over this. how do people get over this?

first off, i grew up in a cult that installed very weird thought patterns in me, in a very metaphorical way. a lot of things like ritual abuse happened there. i lived in the core of the cult from ages 0-12. it was so traumatic that i am almost 100% certain that my schizophrenia is from the trauma they inflicted on me as a child.


aaaaanyway.

due to this experience i've gone through a lot of phases of thought process. 

i have been absolutely **STUCK** on the idea that i was a social experiment, that these people from the cult were watching me and building statistics off me and the 11 or so other kids that suffered with me, and that i was very important to whatever study they were doing because i was the **only** ethnic child. the rest of them were white with blonde hair and blue eyes. i was their black sheep. very important. so important that they're going to kidnap me and bring me back to the compound i grew up in and harvest me finally. or something.

*but*, a voice in my head that is not my own is screaming, ""thats a dangerous delusion! fix it before we do something stupid!!""

so idk i think im reaching out for help or maybe just journaling so i can focus on the fact its a delusion. it still feels like the truth. but the voices like to downplay it as a delusion.",Schizophrenia

"I started 15mg around two weeks ago I think, and I noticed I started having a lot of extreme impulses to drink, gamble, have sex, take illicit drugs, use PRN medication for recreational reasons, and found it much harder not to lose my temper due to small inconveniences. Nothing major happened that I can't recover from when I was on the higher dose but I did definitely do a lot of uncharacteristic things and damaged a lot of  relationships maybe irreparably. I'm not entirely sure where all of this was coming from, I've had mania from TMS before and that was somewhat similar but not nearly as severe and with the effect from Abilify I have no idea where this was all coming from. I've tapered down to 2.5mg and I think it might be helping with motivation and depression but I'm not sure, I don't think it's doing anything for psychosis.

The only side effects I have no are just a mild hand tremor but I ever since being on clozapine I've had that even after stopping clozapine and then being on no antipsychotics, and I think it might have some sort of sexual side effect but I'm starting to think that's just the absence of not having low libido from antipsychotics and antidepressants. Is it possible that I could slowly increase the dose and maybe the side effects I had were from suddenly being on 15mg from nothing? Or would it just not be worth it? I'm not particularly keen on changing medication because this is the one medication that at least doesn't make me emotionally numb. Has anyone had this but managed it? Thanks.",Schizophrenia
"Hello. I'm diagnosed schizoaffective bipolar type. 
Currently unmedicated and coming out of psychotic period. Have had bad reactions to the last 2 antipsychotics I took, one seems to have spurred this episode. 
I am still seeing a psychiatrist and getting DNA tested to see what medication I will have a good reaction to. 

As I am coming out of psychosis I am aware some of my spirituality may be hallucinations or delusions. Like my visions of Greek and Hindu deities, and feelings of having interacted or been blessed by them. 

Upon researching schizophrenia and religion, I found that we are equally likely as the average person to be spiritual in some way. So in that regard, we actually think similar to the majority of the population. So, does that make spiritualism beneficial to schizophrenics, or could it worsen symptoms?

I'm worried that denying my spirituality may be as bad as accepting it. Wondering if anyone is pagan or spiritual and has tips on balancing psychosis and their souls journey? Has anyone felt benefited by being atheist over spiritual? Or do you feel spirituality is helpful to curb symptoms? Other thoughts? 

I want to get better and get treatment. I also want to make sure I don't have break through symptoms. But I will miss seeing the Gods ðŸ˜­",Schizophrenia

"So this ain't by far the worst I've infiltrated but it might be something worth sharing. So I made it kind of a thing to visit all kinds of discord servers that have very specific occult followings. Some are not that extreme and some are. Especially from this server I got some fucked up vibes. So these people had countless of terms for themselves like ""Starseed"" which basically means that your soul has been living one or more lives with an alien race. And that you are able to recall on those memories which is ofcourse why they seem to be 100% convinced that this is who they are. I have had a few talks with these guys and from a certain point on I was asking some questions about his home planet. From a certain point on (these people don't even refer to themselves as humans anymore so I'm just gonna say IT) it started to get mad at me for trying to start a war with the leader of the planet after I aksed it if earth would stand a chance against them (cyvrons from the planet cyvron). Then it started to have some kind of psychotic episode and hit caps lock from then. It started talking about how dangerous the cyvrons actually are and how they are the most dangerous life forms in the whole galaxy that shouldn't be messed with. He also said a cyvron has an estimated lifespan of 16-18k years and that they could destroy earth with a small fleet if they wanted and proceeded to talk about how earth already had been in a fight with them which we lost. Then I denied that I wanted to start a war and said I never said that which was true. Then it started to get even more mad at me for even trying to bring it up and asked me what I had to say in my defence. I said: it's A me MARIO. Then he banned me.",Schizophrenia

"I've struggled with (undiagnosed) schizophrenia among other things for almost a decade. I've done extensive research so I know what I'm feeling is correct, but due to inability to access care (I'm in a rural area with only a few therapists that accept my insurance, and even then it's  expensive) I'm basically stuck. Can't see a therapist (I've seen over 5 in my area and they all haven't helped me), therefore cannot get diagnosed. 
But a friend who is diagnosed with schizophrenia told me that the only way to find relief through what I'm going through is seeing a psychiatrist and getting on medication, NOT a therapist. This was after I told him I've been trying therapist after therapist and none of them seem to understand the â€œI feel like I'm losing my mindâ€ feeling, so it only makes me feel for isolated. 
I have a complicated feelings about medication. I'm totally for it for other people, my girlfriend takes medication and it's helped her improve dramatically. But I personally do not trust it.

Hello everyone, I have had a transplant operation on the left cornea and I have 2/10 in the left eye, I have done crosslinking twice in the right eye where I have 8/10, I have very very high severe astigmatism and I do not wear any type correction. What I wanted to ask you, since I am a very hypochondriac subject, is it normal for my problems to see things as if they are moving?

"Okay trying again but making a more clear post. 
I would like to preface this by stating that Thirteen psychs and therapist have said I do not have anything psychotic or delusional(not to mention all the er visits that have also said no)

I do not have a family history of anything delusional or psychotic. My biological mom does have bipolar but I have been ruled out for that as well as major depressive disorder and again anything psychotic. 

However I can't shake the feeling that something is being missed or that something else is wrong with me. 

I'm pregnant for the first time ever I'm 25 weeks along and before I knew I was pregnant went off my effexor (because it wasn't helping me) and smoked pot for the first time for maybe about ten days. 

I stopped immediately after having a panic attack where I experienced dpdr. (Everything felt fake time slowed down I felt like I was dreaming even wondered if I was hallucinating everything around me. but consciously still knew I was fine and that none of that was true) 

I was fine the next day but the day after that my ocd started focusing on harm thoughts. I've had a long history of ocd, as a kid I was worried with my own mortality and worried and obsessed about natural disasters like tornados killing me and my mom, I've had intrusive thoughts about harming my cat which I have since worked through and never wanted to act on. I have had relationship ocd where I worried if my partner was cheating on me and or if he really loved me. I have had perfection ocd where I worried if my boss liked me and the job I was doing. But I never was aware what I was struggling with was ocd  (because of common pop culture representation) i only ever thought it was anxiety 

The thoughts I began to have were ""what if I stabbed my husband?"" Or ""what if I choked my mom?"" Or ""what if im having a psychotic break and do something I don't mean to do?"" (Because I started researching about psychosis and delusions and Scizophrenia, big mistake) 

I eventually went to the er and they diagnosed me with ocd and sent me home. 

I worked through the ocd but then the derealization came back. Nothing felt real/felt like I was in a dream/ I started worrying about existinal thoughts (existinal ocd) 'where I wondered how reality worked ?"" ""What If I was dreaming my whole life?"" ""What if the world was a simulation?"" I worried so much I went back to the er and they again sent me home saying it was just my ocd and gad and dpdr. I also found out I was a month pregnant at this time. 


I then started compulsively researching Scizophrenia/ delusional disorder/ psychosis because the dpdr and existinal ocd made me feel like I was crazy or suffering from something worse. 

So then my themes switched to fear of having a psychosis disorder (any of them all of them I was really scared.) It first started as being hyper focused on sounds worried I could be hallucinating. Eventually that went away and I started worrying about common delusions people with psychotic disorders may have. I didn't even know these were a thing until I looked them up. (Thanks ocd) 

They freaked me out so much that people could think that way that my ocd intrusive thoughts started mimicking them in a way. ""What if your mom/husband poisioned your food?"" 
""What if someone was out to get you?"" ""What if your hallucinating everything and you don't know?"" Etc. 
I never beleived any of these thoughts because I knew they were extremely irrational however because of my fears of becoming psychotic and not being able to care for my baby on the way and be a good wife to my husband (who is my biggest support and best friend aside from my mom ) they made me so anxious I worried that if I thought them I must beleive them (even though again I knew deep down I didn't and that they only appeared after reading about them) 

Anyway that brings us to now. I have in the last month switched over to a new psych and therapist after working with my old ones for a year because my old ones made things worse. 

My old therapist fed the ocd sooooo much and never taught me the proper way to deal with it (what I now know is erp) and my old psychiatrist would put me on multiple meds at a time and take me off of them with in two to three weeks if I wasn't (in his words) ""better"" by then. 

I tried lexapro/trazadone/buspar(made dpdr worse)

Amd lastly a low dose (50mg) of seroquel for ""sleep and anxiety"" 

Seroquel made my dpdr (depersonalization and derealization) so bad that people like my husband and mom and even cat at times looked unfamiliar and felt like strangers al my memories with these people and of my life felt distant or like thwy happened to someone else. I still knew who they were but everything felt off. Even my own home felt and looked odd to me. 


I was officially convinced I was psychotic after experiencing this because no one on my old team explained to me that what I was going through in these moments of ""unreality"" was a anxiety/stress trauma response called dpdr. 

So as any compulsive person does I took to reddit and Google to research why my loved ones felt like stranger to me (and at times looked strange) I of course found plenty of dpdr related articles. But the one that stuck out to me was a article about caogras delusion. 

Capgras is a delusion typically found in patients with demntia/lewy body/ alzihmers(I know I spelt it wrong) and of course my biggest fear paranoid Scizophrenia. It is a delusion where people have the belief that a loved one has been replaced with usually one of the following 
A clone
A doppelganger 
A imposter 
A alien or monster 
Or a robot. 

Now at first I was like ""Okay that's obviously not me because I don't beleive in clones or doppelganger or imposters aliens or robots "" but then the ocd took over and my ocd intrusive thoughts began mimicking this delusions (as it has done with other delusions in the past) 

""What if your husband isn't your husband?"" 
""What if he's been replaced?"" 
""What if he Is a alien?"" 
""How do people eve exist?""

I never even knew these were thoughts a person could have until I read about it and now I wish I hadn't. I then started seeing my new psychiatrist and therapist. My new psychiatrist got me off the seroquel and put me on zoloft I am now up to 200mg of zoloft and it seems to be helping for the most part (though I don't think it's fully in my system yet) she said I'm not psychotic and that this is just a mixture of being on the wrong medication plus hormones from being pregnant plus dpdr/anxiety/and ocd. 

My new therapist said the same and that all of my thoughts and anxieties were normal for ocd with the fear of Scizophrenia and or a existinal theme and that I wasn't delusional or psychotic in the slightest and that we would start the proper therapy (erp) to help with this. 

My dpdr has calmed down quite a bit I don't have it every day like I did on seroquel. I still have moments of it but I'm mostly able to sit with it and let it past. But the thought of ""What if my husband has been replaced?"" Has been coming and going and causing me distress since June 6th. Some days I am able to be like ""wtf that's not possible its just the dpdr and ocd"" and other days like yesterday I'm in tears and fully convinced I'm delusional and that I may beleive it (even though again deep down I know I dont) 

I am hustle worried one day I will fully beleive this and hurt him. ðŸ˜¢  and I don't want that to happen. I am also worried that if this isn't undercontrol soon I will be a terrible mom to my baby and wife to my husband. 

Espically if I do become delusional. 

I guess what I'm looking for here is insight. 

Should I trust my doctors and the Thirteen other providers that told me it's just ocd dpdr anxiety and hormones 

Or is it something worse going unseen or something starting to develop?  

I know this is reassurance seeking but I'm just so worried and in the early stages of therapy and really trying to beat the ocd. I also feel like I'm the only possible person to experience this thought. 

Has anyone else dealt with this?

"

So, my little sister is 18 years old. But most of the time she acts like a really young teen. In the last years she changed a lot. Everything seems different now. Her style, her way of talking, her interests. She really got into the topic climate change, which is a good thing of course, but then she started to skip school because of her believe that the global warming will kill us in a few years. Every time she had to write an essay at school, she wrote about climate change, regardless of what the actual topic was. Then her boyfriend died last year and everything just got worse. On some days she seems normal and on others she just seems like she's on drugs. At first I thought she's developing a drug addiction. But they checked her urine and it was clean. She just smoked weed in the past. I can't really explain her state of mind because it's hard to comprehend. Probably also because I don't live with her and my parents anymore. Sometimes she'll write me messages and I can't understand them. And then I'm not sure if I don't understand her because she does this on purpose or if she can't help herself. Additionally, she's a very artistic person, so I don't always know if she's just living her artistic streak or if she's in a bad mental state.
So it has definitely gotten worse. Luckily she realised that she needs help and got into a clinic a few weeks ago where she stays during daytime. The therapists and psychiatrists think that she has a psychotic episode and that she will develop schizophrenia if she won't take medication. Unfortunately, she decided to leave the clinic after hearing about this doctor's assessment.
And now I'm terrified of course. I'm scared that she'll get paranoid and that she will develop schizophrenia. Because if she doesn't want to take any medication now, what will that look like once she has developed schizophrenia? She will then refuse the medication even more. Another problem is that I only talk to my mother about her mental state because my sister won't really talk to me about private problems anymore. That's mostly because we got into a fight because I told her that she can't handle this on her own anymore and that in her current state she should definitely not smoke weed. It's just that I'm the only one in our family who has at least rudimentary experience in the field of psychiatry. I am mentally ill too and I've been in a lot of mental health facilities in the last years. 
I am so scared that I will lose my little baby sister. For me she is still a child because she still behaves like that. I don't know what to do I just want to scream at her and tell her that she should take her meds. She's so incredibly self-centered at the moment and thinks she knows better. She thinks spirituality will heal her and that all the doctors can fuck off. But I know for sure that this is not true.
Since you all have a lot more experience than me, I wanted to ask you what you would do in my place. I try to keep my distance and give her space. But is there any way to make her understand that she should take the meds? Is there any way I won't lose her?",Schizophrenia

What I wanted to ask you, since I am a very hypochondriac subject, is it normal for my problems to see things as if they are moving? I'll give you an example: I walk and looking at the buildings and the street, it seems as if they were coming towards me, I'm very afraid it could be something serious like hallucinations and neurological ...",Schizophrenia
"I don't know if I'm schizophrenic but lately I've been feeling an overwhelming sense of dread. Everything has been feeling like a sign from God. I feel so anxious I can't even think straight.
For the last couple of days I've been compulsively looking at my clock and adding up the numbers to see if they equal 13. I'm relieved when they don't. I want it to stop it hurts it hurts so much. Is it God or demons I don't know I can't tell I just want it to stop",Schizophrenia
"I (f20) have a coworker (m25-30?) who was moved into my department as housekeeping at a hotel. He previously was front desk but had an episode so they switched his position. 

My issues: let me just say he's a super nice guy and no one has any issues with him as a person, it all comes down to the work he puts out. 

As housekeeping we are the ones getting rooms ready for new guests. On a good day we could get 10 rooms on a bad day it can be 20. Recently I've been paired with him and it has been anything but easy. Usually two people together makes it go by faster and we can get out early but the quality of his cleaning isn't up to our standards so whenever our supervisors come and check the room I end up having to redo anything he just â€œcleanedâ€. 

Some of the things seem like such obvious nono's for him to do. Like he left a bath mat on the wall, hair in the tub, splatters on the mirror, beds lumpy, not tucked in, etc. At the end of the day I end up staying later fixing his rooms because they don't get the pass.

What I need help with is knowing if this could be more of an issue because of his condition? I have an uncle who has it but to my understanding it doesn't hinder his ability to work. 

None of our supervisors or coworkers want to work with him or have him on our team because he does make our jobs harder. We all feel really bad because of the circumstances but at the same time part of me wonders if his schizophrenia contributes at all or if he on his own just isn't cut out for this work?

I'm trying to be respectful as possible since I don't have much experience on this subreddit and am just trying to gather information and understand his situation betterâ€¦ so hopefully none of this is offensive or stigma of some sort. I truly just don't know.

Once again I know he means well and I feel bad for disliking the guy when it comes to work. I've been told by our supervisors that they've asked to fire him but the head manager has insisted on keeping him on due to his condition.

Thanks for your time.",Schizophrenia

"I'm only making a half assumption because I believe there's reason to my thinking here. I'm not one of those that thinks they're hallucinating because I seen my own shadow and then asking am I becoming schizophrenic? That's not me at all. The first semi or full on psychosis was kinda build up over the years and I can't say I really had hallucinations that I was aware of I guess or am I able to remember? There was a lot visual illusions or derealization if you want to interpret it as that.

For a year or so, I've been doing some mental health investigation almost to a really obsessive levels ok no yeah to really excessive level. This was brought on to the apparent ""cognitive decline"" I suspect I was having before drug use. It's too long to explain why I really thought that. Started based on my own created conspiracy theory of people in control of simulation. Anyways to a certain point it became true based on my probably just burning myself out mentally and the drug use.

Also I did start having minor hallucinations I guess or hppd that was more than visual illusions but again I suspect that to be drug use to certain degree. Anyways though I don't expect this was full blown schizophrenia or even that at all. From what I'm aware of though even in my experience with meth trip (again I totally based that experience on the drug and sleep deprivation), you not aware you're hallucinating unless you're made aware. I was caught when I had my trip and was in shell shock that none of what I saw and heard was real.

Crazy part is though I know exactly of people with schizophrenia feel when I talk to them for a lot of what they experience. For the direct voices talking to me part no that hasn't really happen to me. The delusions definitely hit home with me for sure.

Now for my psychosis stories:

So I've had grandiose delusions with believing to be in a simulation with people as actors. I could control things with my mind. I thought I was telepathic. I thought there was this architect in control making me doing horrible things to people and trying to make a fool out of me and cause embarrassment. I also thought I was going to be the next savior chosen by God to take over these hive minded people. I started blowing my money and giving 85% of it to the church. 

I thought I would free the hive mind yet still in be in control with my own values instilled into them. Also thought I was gonna be the greatest rapper and blew 5 grand on a mixtape that flopped. Then there was superstitions of trusting myself to eat other people's food because I thought it was poison. Then I thought I seen myself almost morphing into God when I looked in the mirror. There was also an obsession with people, places, and things having significant meaning. I probably unintentionally freaked a few people out with that and I do apologize immensely. 

I'm sure there was other strange beliefs I had as well but my memory lags...

I didn't tell people what was in my head because of the possible consequences of thinking I would be killed and replaced by a clone, turned into a npc, have a lobotomy done or being disowned and taken away somewhere else. 

Then in more recent years I question if I have a brain tumor or some sort of neurological disorder. I did a lot of drugs during that time and that didn't help so I'm still in recovery. That has not been a fun experience and I'm sure because of the couple of mishaps in communication (forgetting some words or not paying attention at all and my mouth not running on hyperspeed), I was just being human. However, the drugs I've done have not assuaged the fear and made the cognitive and physical decline come true but I know it was min(d)e fault. The drug use ended with my last meth trip with one of the hallucinations being my family having an intervention with me telling me to stop. It was very vivid ephinal experience. 

Not I'm sure what how I feel these days. It just like a flatline of emotions and disassociation. I'm worried if I really done some damage. There has been some improvements with my thinking and I tend to be more logical now. I don't trust people at all and think there's a some sort of ulterior motive to try to hurt me. Loneliness has been prevalent too. I don't have as many friends anymore either. I only take antipsychotics when I feel I really need them. 

I guess I would like to hear your proposition on it. Could what I'm feeling right now be some sort of prerequisite(like a calm before the storm) to a deeper psychosis? I do show almost if not all the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The derealization has been dissipating now. I do have a really high sensitivity to things now whether that be light, sound, etc. There's problems with seeing people's face in weird way at times and things moving at times. Occasionally hearing very slight voices however is not as bad it was. I have weird sensations all over my body too.

I don't know what to think of this experiences I've had. I wouldn't be scared to be find how I am actually schizophrenic or not. Honestly I be happy with a bigger explaination other than psychosis so I know I'm not just crazy ðŸ¤£. Could this have been lighter psychosis episodes and now I'm in the prodromal phase for the real thing. I don't really trust doctors and will not say anything until I actually starting having the same experience as the meth trip except without the drug use.

Best speculations and diagnosis I got were Bipolar, Schizotypal, or unspecified personally disorder and I did not share the delusions or even really got into detail with my thought process I had or was having with the psych docs.

" Hi everyone! I'm diagnosed bipolar 1, but I've been having some psychotic symptoms that don't really seem to match with mania. I'm seeing my psychiatrist soon for some professional input, but wanted to ask you all if my experiences soundedÂ familiar.

For one, I've had the worst brain fog and feel exhausted when I have psychotic symptoms. Phrases loop through my head, sometimes really random ones like ""Let's go get some food."" I have some cognitive issues too, where my mind will literally go blank and I can't speak, or I move slowly. I lose interest in everything,Â including eating.Â My mind also gets very fuzzy.  
Most of my psychotic symptoms are paranoid, and I'm very anxious. I think ""they,"" whoever they are, are watching me, to theÂ point where I'm having trouble falling asleep because I'm terrified. I'm terrified of dogs on the street, crossing the street, and interacting socially. Socially, I never have anything to say and feel so awkward, especially compared to how outgoing I used to be. 

I see things in my peripheral vision and hear my name called every once in a while.Â I also have had delusions that I made a deal with the devil and there are witches surrounding my house. 

I don't seem manic during these at all, and I'm not exactly depressed. I'm just in a state of not feeling. Does this sound similar to your own prodromal state?",Schizophrenia

"Okay so I have ocd and my theme is mostly existential and fear of losing my mind becoming delusional etc. 

Im 22 (family history with bio mom having bipolar but ive never had it or any signs) I tried pot for the first time back in January (didn't know I was also pregnant then) had a panic attack where dpdr was induced. Everything felt unreal and I had intrusive thoughts about what if everything was fake. 

Anyway I was fine the next day the days following the 11th I began having intrusive thoughts about stabbing my husband but didn't want to act on it thought and worried I was psychotic went to the hospital they diagnosed me with ocd. 

Compulsions are googling researching and reassurance seeking. 

Found out I was a month pregnant in February 

I've had intrusive thoughts about reality ""how are people real"" ""is the world fake or a simulation"" ""am I on a dream"" 

These usually came with the dpdr and then the ocd 

Anyway I tried a few different meds. 

Lexapro (made me agitated)
Effexor (made me more anxious)
Buspar (made dpdr worse) 
Trazadone (did nothing ?) 

And then possibly the worse one was seroquel at 50mg to help my ""depression"" (I don't actually have a true depressive disorder my past psychiatrist and therapist wasn't great)

Seroquel made my dpdr so bad that people like my husband and mom and even cat and my surroundings like my apartment and mom's house looked unfamiliar. Not to mention a feeling of detachment from my memories or these people. Like I had never belonged to these people. I know it's my mom and husband but things just felt off. 

Anyway I got a new psychiatrist and therapist that actually understand my ocd and put me on zoloft I'm up to 200mg now and took me completely off of seroquel. But I don't beleive it's fully got in my system. 

Before I met with them though I had read SO MUCH about Scizophrenia (specifically delusions) that I had convinced myself I had it. I am slowly coming down from this but one thought still plagues my mind. 

Because things looked unfamiliar due to what I now understand is dpdr I looked up what was causing this because  I didn't know my old psych didn't know what dpdr was. 

Dpdr came up but so did capgras delusion and of course me being afariad of Scizophrenia/psychosis/delusions as a part of my ocd themes I freaked out 

My thought then started becoming ""What if your husband has been replaced?"" Or ""what if that's not your husband?"" I know these thought are not true. I don't beleive in aliens or doplagangers and I don't beleive the government clones people but the thoughts still play over and over despite me knowing that my husband is still in front of me. 

The disconnect I feel plus the feeling of unfamiliarity both from the dpdr + plus the fear of being delusional and the ocd thoughts are such a terrible mix though and make me so anxious sometimes that I convince myself capgras is happening to me despite 

1. Not having known about it until I compulsively googled symptoms 

And 

2. Being told by my therapist and psych that it's 100% nothing delusional or psychotic but rather a fear of becoming so and that the dpdr and ocd are just fighting each other

"TL;DR: my mother is unhealthily obsessed with a celebrity she's never met, and is having delusions that they're in a psychic relationship. 
___________________________________

Let me start off by saying if this is the wrong community to post this in then I do apologize, there just isn't a lot of places on the internet where erotomania is mentioned. If this is the wrong place, and there's a better place please let me know!
For a little background my mother has had random celebrity obsessions for as long as I've been alive. It changes every few years or so but the infatuation gets worse with every new person. It started like most people who are a fan of a certain celebrity, she would watch anything that they were in and join forums to discuss that celebrity with like-minded fans. More Stan behavior than anything harmful, that is until the past couple years. 
I'd say things really started to kick up when a singer died a few years back. She had made a shrine, with candles and photos and little trinkets and every month on the anniversary of the singer's death she would light the candles listen to his music and mourn. She got a tattoo in memorial of the celebrity, and filled her home with memorabilia of the celebrity. 

About a year ago her object of fixation changed again, this time to an actor. This current obsession is worse than anything I've seen from her in the past, so bad that I am writing this Reddit post.
Her personal social media pages have basically turned into fan pages, no photos posted of friends or family, barely any personal status updates just photos of her current celebrity obsession. She's written letters to him, and sent them to him. She monitors his social medias so that she knows when he is in California so that she can go and try and see him. She wears an exact replica of a bracelet he wore in a movie. 

She has mentioned to my siblings and her friends that she is receiving psychic messages from him and that he talks to her telepathically. She believes that they are in a relationship, and that â€œthe universeâ€ is pushing them together, and he just can't see it yet. She's started doing more for her appearance, which I initially thought was for herself, but I've realized it's for him. 
My mother has displayed signs of bipolar disorder my entire life, and delusions/psychosis runs through her side of my family (I have experienced auditory hallucinations and mild psychosis myself, and have been receiving mental health help for about 7 years now)
I know how real delusions can feel, as I've experienced of myself. So I never want to necessarily invalidate her, or make her feel bad, But I'm incredibly worried. I'm afraid she will eventually be served some sort of legal ramifications, and I worry what the rejection will have her do to herself. I have very gently, and indirectly pressed her on this, and she gets defensive and upset with me because she feels that I'm not supporting her. We have a complicated relationship, as I try and work through some of what happened in my childhood while still maintaining a relationship with her. I care about her very much, and I am worried about her. 
Are there any support groups for Family members or adult children of people with erotomania? What can I do for her? What can I do for myself?

"(My self-reflection thread.)

I've been in support group many years now and have many friends. But I've never really been attracted to any guy there. But my support group director introduced me to a few who he probably believes to be decent guys to befriend. One is in his 40s, bipolar, works with prison inmates. After I friended him on Facebook, I realized he has a â€œbad boyâ€ side so I started avoiding him though he seems cool. He broke up with this girl he really likes and seems to want to be her soulmateâ€¦ from their Facebook posts, I feel like he must've done something wrong. I don't think she dumped him because he was poor, but I don't know for certain. Another guy is a low functioning guy also in his 40s. Tbh, he is not attractive at all and I feel like he stalks me because he thinks I'm pretty. I don't think you get a gf by praying to God or something. I care about them, but I'm sort of notoriously bad at dating. I dated two guys in the past, both of whom I didn't feel strongly for. And I can be kind of nasty/very insensitive, get mad when they don't shower, etc. Then one day I meet a guy online who is young and smart and when I kissed him I couldn't stop thinking about him. He broke up with me and I've resigned to look for love no more. I don't want to date either guys I mentioned above but maybe this is their identity. They want to see themselves as guys who have meaningful connections with a girl. Of course they often all go after the same young/pretty ones who might be troubled, never some nice but homely person. My dad is retiring soon and he plans to take my mom to become expats in Southeast Asia and leave me to care for everything. I wonder if I will just be alone with the dogs.

If I get distracted/relaxed enough, it stops, but that's also difficult to achieve.

I've been trying to keep an open mind about this being just a delusion, but paired with the physical components, it's more likely to me that it's really happening.

How can I take my antipsychotics and get them to work if the whole entire time I'm just anxious I'm so convinced there's something wrong with them like u have idea like I'm so convinced that they have electricity on them that I'm literally making it a reality that they have something on them and no one is telling me other wise I have to talk to my therapist about this but until then I suffer and I'm sorry but there's just no way the lights flickered as soon as my psychiatrist brought up the medication like that's just too coincidental that something like that would happen like of course it happens to me of course I'm just gonna give up I don't want to but how can I if I can't even take medication to help me if I think something is wrong with it like I just can't do this please someone reach out it comment and tell me what to do bc I'm losing my mind and I'm so anxious rn that my heart is racing out of my chest bc I feel like they're doing something to my body due to the fact that the lights flickered as soon as my psychiatrist brought up the medicine for my schizophrenia.,Schizophrenia

"I just wanted to say hi. Ugh im so awkward. So basically I'm just looking for anybody else in the world who can understand what I'm going through. I got diagnosed 8ish years ago. Ive been medicated pretty much since diagnosis and have been leading a pretty normal, if not a tad eccentric, life. Met a guy, got married, have a job. You know, normal shit. 

Well now as part of the normal things you do, my husband and I want kids. Totally great! Except I've had to start coming off my meds. And im TERRIFIED. It's been 3 weeks off my SSRIs, and one antipsychotic, and lower does of my main antipsychotic. Oh and 2 months off birth control. My mood has been unstable, im paranoid at work, on the road, around people, and yesterday I had my first relapse into delusions. But thats not really what has me scared. Like, im not dumb, i was obviously expecting this. But im starting to realize a critical detail i overlooked going into this. My husband, my friends, my coworkers, have 0 idea who i am without my meds. And im starting to realize that i dont even know who i really know who i am. I was 19 when i started taking them. And i find myself wanting to EXPLODE. And self sabotage. And do terrible things. And getting really upset and heartbroken when i tell myself no.

God im rambling. Im sorry. Idk. Has anybody here ever gone off their meds to get preggers? 

For clarification, i am working with my doc towards this. And i am not currently preggers.",Schizophrenia
"Sometimes I'm not right but if someone who has good intentions corrects me, I don't mind changing my mind. My family recently moved to a new house and I put the photos online. I feel like many of my mentally ill friends who live in group homes or on minimum wage are kind of reacting to that, possibly wishing they could go to the mall and buy some cotton candy and not worry about money. I was a scholarship student at a prestigious high school and everyone there was wealthier than me so I'm not used to this type of behavior. That said, I want to have some distance from my mentally ill friends. They rejected the song I heard that reminded me of them, a song about saying goodbye. But it's the closest I've felt about what someone on their deathbed would sing, the journey they walked with their wife, and leaving earth life behind with nothing to fear. It reminds me of my grandparents, who I think really loved each other. I feel like my mentally ill friends want me to display infinite power and wealth, but all I wanted was to write them into this chapter of my life, and tbh I'm undecided whether to give them infinite power. I also want to point out that for some reason people are quick to assume things, sort of like if they start arguing before I'm done talking... but I want to know how they truly feel, what their dreams are, etc.",Schizophrenia

"(I've been on here for awhile so I'm not a new member, I just don't talk. )

I've always had problems sleeping, in fact didn't even like sleep until I read some where  that I could develop insomnia and die from it.  So I guess my schizophrenia developed from a mix of caffeine/vaping/weed/stress. I was micro dosing weed every night to go to sleep for 3 months (just enough for a buzz) but I also vaped and that acted as a stabilizer. I was also into medication and lucid dreams. 

When I was diagnosed, I was hearing voices on the outside of my head, normal people talking( more positive than negative). My  sense of smell, taste, orientation were affected. I also had tactile hallucinations. 

Had a crazy episode and went to a psych ward for a week. Then had another even more crazy episode and went back again, living with my parents so they were going to kick me out if I didn't go.

Prescribed meds (Abilify and seroquel) 
Wasn't working, so I stopped taking them after 2-3 months .

"Hi, i am sunny. I am 18 and i have been displaying phycotic symptoms for the past 2 months. Me and my boyfriend are very concerned about any progesssion i may have. So far i have been having auditory hallucinations, peripheral and minor visual hallucinations, intrusive somewhat paranoid thoughts, an extreme fear that i will run out of money and end up homeless.

 I recently had a visit with my psychiatrist to get any help. I went into it with her misunderstanding what i needed big time. I wanted a full diagnosis, advice, help, and education on meds (note i am willing to take meds but only if i know what the fuck their going to do to me). Instead she kept throwing out the names of medications i dont know shit about and not explaining why i need it, how it will work, and what the draw backs are for it. She ended up simultaneously scaring the fuck out of me and leaving me with no education on whats wrong or what i truly have. I feel completely hopless, i feel like because i cant fit a box i cannot get taken seriously to get any fucking help. I am so fucking scared, because its ""easy"" or ""manageable"" now and the system and the people who "" have the answers"" refuse to properly examine me and instead just want to throw medication at me immediately. 

My question is what is it going to be like in 2 months or 6 months. Are they going to catch my symptoms before i go to far. WILL they catch me then? When im so fucking gone that i cant even tell the difference betwen reality and my brains shitty fabricated fantasies. I feel so dumb, i feel like the system cannot help me unless i am in phycosis and severely fucked up. And that makes me feel so alone and afraid.

 Today i was crying on the patio of my work, my face sobbing on hard burning concrete, and it felt conformable. It felt nice to have my face against rough concrete almost burning hot concrete. All while having a panic attack and feeling awful and feeling like im not only going to lose myself but my boyfriend and the very few people i love. I believe about an hour later i broke, big time. I felt like i could throw my life away and should. I felt like i should quit my job and take my care and drive to any state i want and waste all of my savings. Because i cant  take this, i cant take a waiting and feeling like a stupid fucking bitch for being worried about how i may progress and if i will get far worse. And im going to be honest i am one step away from doing it, even with me not being out of it the way i was before. But yeah, im at my limit. And i will admit i need help from the people who have experienced and dealt with their mental illness and the system. If anyone here has any advice or resources on the early stages of of schizophrenia and on if or how i will progress. I need major help with what meds, if any, to choose now or later down the road.

I work in a nonprofit and one of my clients (diagnosed with paranoia/ potentialy schizophrenia) is really ill and I worry about his safety. He has auditory hallucinations and has cut pretty much everyone except me out of life due to suspecting they are drugging him/ raping him/ working with government. Sometimes he perceives himself to be a prophet or messenger of a higher power. I do not have the expertise and cannot help him or really engage with what he has going on mental healthwise, but I care about him and really would like some help on the best way to engage since I think I'm the last person he trusts. I try to meet him where he's at and acknowledge and validate the emotions he's feelings, but sometimes it becomes way outside of my scope of expertise. 

I know everyone is different, but are there any good techniques to help him get help or communicate with him when he gets in these spirals. We are all people fighting our own battles here, and everyone deserves to live the happiest life they can. Right now I worry about him and his safety, especially if he were to get aggressive with the police (has happened before) and they see a brown man and shoot.

I got fired from my job because I thought my coworkers were lying about me, I embarrassed myself completely by exposing all of my delusions on Twitter, and I acted verbally aggressive towards friends and strangers. I tweeted a couple of threats, including saying the super bowl should be cancelled or else because I thought peoples heads were going to explode and threatening to harm Biden &amp; Obama because I thought I received a telepathic message that Taylor Swift was kidnapped by the government (I spoke to the Secret Service but they understood I was sick lol).

I wasnt going to school, i was not taking care of myself, attacking my parents and things like that. I went unmedicated for 2 years and my situation got worse overtime. Then i decided to see a psychiatrist and i was prescripted Zoloft. After using that i started to show clear signs of bipolar disorder, mostly depressive episodes. Now I'm on 20 mg of Zyprexa. But the thing is even though my mania and depression went away, i can clearly tell there's still something wrong. 3 weeks ago my period was 2 days late and i was sure i was pregnant even though ive never engaded in sexual activity. I called my mom told her that â€œI think my dad raped me in my sleep, i might be pregnant, can you get me a test?â€ She got very angry but i didn't really care because i was very scared of whats going to happen.

I immediately jumped out of my bed, turned to check around to room, even though i couldn't see anyone i was sure someone was in there with me. And theres like other things i dont really wanna talk about. I also dont know if its related but i can see it when walls are moving and objects are breathing.

I haven't worried about anyone wanting to hurt me for a while too, which is great. I don't think that I'm being watched or hacked either. I realized this morning that people didn't seem to be staring at me, and when they glance over, I don't assume they mean anything by it.


I haven't seen or heard anything that had me guessing if it was real for a while. It's great to be able to trust my senses.


In my classes, my brain felt like it used to. Or at least as close to it as it has been in the past few years. It's a really great feeling to not have the constant thought of being stupid repeating itself over and over again in my head.


My thoughts are now articulate, I don't feel lost and robbed of them. I can think freely. I remember what I thought afterwards too.



And finally, my feelings are good. I really like music, I want to be with people, and I feel like I love my family.



I know it probably won't last forever, but nothing does. I just wanted to say I'm happy and maybe help someone consider the possibility they might one day be happy too. That's all.",Schizophrenia
"I feel like I hold some unpopular opinions about my mentally ill friends. Part of it is that I can't sense their energy/spirit. I think their souls might've been operated on. But on the other hand, I feel like many guys with mental illness want me to help them find a partner. I've been hit on regularly at support group and it is not amusing for me. I don't really want to help since I'm bad at dating to begin with and relationships really is not my strength. But I really don't like it when guys â€œcan't liveâ€ without having a girlfriend and I feel like it's something guys have to fight for largely on their own. It doesn't feel like true love if they fall in love with every girl they see. I will not accept another guy's love for me. I want it to be someone else. One day you will die and only your soul will go to Heaven and at that time you have to accept yourself no matter how disgusting you think you are. Idk, I'm thinking about one of the low functioning mentally ill guys I've met through friends. I will help him but I want them to respect a girl if they reject him. I don't want to turn any guy into a prince because they have a mental illness. That said, I miss my BFF. She keeps going after these insanely perfect girls and gets turned down every time...

"I'm since many years diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia, also my schizophrenia is a comparatively mild case.
I never heard voices, only had once visual hallucinations, but had delusional thinking about a specific topic field and like magical thinking tendencies of seeing meaning/connections in things were are none.

i was several times in psychiatric clinic, had several therapies, had lived in a flatshare for young adults with mental health issues for a few years...

now I know I need therapy, but had a lot of negative experiences with therapy, that's why i avoided/feared it for a long time...

Like my longest therapy was several years with a therapist trained in freudian psychoanalysis... in general in my experience with therapist i felt like a power imbalance, like i could say a thing like, that i believe to be bisexual and just get told that isn't the case... or like i once had a therapist to whom i accidentally said, that i don't like her, and she got angry, demanded that this is the minimal basis... i started reading books about non violent communication, but i couldn't resolve the conflict with her...
another time my therapist felt tired in the session and told me this was caused by a conflict... 

in the psychiatric clinic i sometimes felt like professionals intentionally misunderstand you, to test your reactions, to find out what your current mental state is...
like i once asked the nurses ""please tell me when i'm illogical"" and they reacted ""when you feel uneasy, go play table soccer to release the feelings""... i'm sorry, i atm miss the correct words, it was in german back then...
like i was extremely confused in this moment, did i actually said one thing while actually wanting to say another?
actually talk therapy wasn't a treatment in the clinic, because it would worsen the symptoms, so mostly only medical treatment...

also like my psychiater in germany told me for ages that me sleeping a lot is purely ""psychological"" even when I told him i'm diagnosed with still untreated sleep apnoe... also i was treated with a high dosage of risperidon...
i lived now several years in the uk and never had a face to face appointment with a psychiater, also when i told my gp my issues the wrote an email to one and i got aripripazole perscribed instead of risperidon, what improved my sleeping problems a lot!

like how does one find a therapist, that you can trust, that doesn't ""play emotional power dynamic games"" with you :/ ?

i'm from germany and migrated to the uk...
i feel like there is quite a culture difference, like uk people seem to be more gentle, forgiving in a way...

Title,Schizophrenia
"Reality is dull, mundane and unpleasant to me. I guess I can say that because I don't have bad voices or bad things when I'm off meds, it more just lots of intuitive information about old loves, old lives, all sorts of things, symbols,  feeling connected to the universe, mystical feelings, you know? just never feeling in the mundane, everything much deeper.  I miss it every day as I was unmedicated for like 6 or more years. 

I took the meds finally in 2017, stayed on them for two years and then came off them, suddenly had spirits everywhere and voices non stop [again never bad voices] but the six years I was unmedicated I had minimal spirits and no voices ever. So the meds must have sensitised my receptors or something.

"Good morning everyone

I find that many forms of community addiction support including the 12 steps typical of Alcoholics Anonymous / Narcotics Anonymous can throw a few unique wrenches our way.

This due to features of our symptomology such as social anhedonia, general anhedonia and difficulty feeling able to be more honest about this or explain our inner landscape in a way that is understood or accepted by others without judgement.

Genuine community based on the recognition of each other's truth is a core principle in many forms of recovery, and I have been thinking about forming an addiction sub for those who suffer from anhedonia driven addictions, feeling cut off from the world, or other twists of worldview. As I feel at first-hand many of the saving graces offered by existing addiction supports cannot quite ""reach"" schizophrenics in the way it does others due to interpersonal distance and distortion.

If anyone feels likewise, agrees or disagrees please let me know / DM me/ or message me on discord @ mikipip_song to see if we can get some interest rolling.

"Hello all,

I have Schizoaffective disorder being officially diagnosed back in 2012, 10 years ago. I've been through the ups and downs. Gained 130 lbs pounds (160 to 290) from medication, namely very powerful antipsychotics. 

Anyways, for some reason up until this point I chose to be a Registered Nurse. I was an Occupational Therapy Assistant for 5 years before being an RN now for 1 year. If I could take anything away from my years of experience would be that healthcare is definitely not the place for someone with our condition. It's my fault in that, like most of us, never fully accepted our diagnosis leading to unrealistic expectations. Trying to shift into IT and hopefully work remotely from home. 

I am wondering what others have been, or are doing for work? I read an account of someone with schizophrenia in tech reporting on how his schizophrenic brain is so much like a computer leading to him to excelling at computer programming. In the same vain I realize that the same applies to me too. I wonder if the same applies generally to the schizoaffective(schizophrenic) community. Anyone else an IT guru?

Last thing, medications. I've mentioned before my 130 lbs pound increase from 10 years ago. Is anyone relatively successful in their lives weaned off of medications?

Thank you in advance for any responses.

P.S.&gt; I have been on disability, unemployed, and living in an homeless shelter. My case is not unique. Seek help and treatment.

"When we lived in an apartment earlier this year, our apartments were connected through Xfinity modem boxes that were built into the walls. Theirs was on the other side of the wall right next to ours. One day, our entire apartment was engulfed in a burnt plastic smell. We evacuated the apartment until the next day, but then that following night my son woke up in the middle of the night with visual hallucinations. Seeing strange colors. Fuzzy tv. And a yellow puffy jacket. This was many months ago. He was also exposed to some marital problems/stress. My wife suffers from depression and has a history of trauma and when triggered she just doesn't care to keep her problems and feelings hidden from the children. So they were exposed and have continually exposed to high levels of stress. We are in therapy and I'm actively trying to figure out how to protect them from that but so far with no success. 

Today, he randomly told me that he hears someone calling his name and he hears a jingle sound, and he hears someone calling him for dinner time (and it was still morning). He just randomly told me those things. I have been experiencing some minor hallucinations and or illusions, which also seem to be developing over time but I've attributed that to lack of sleep. I'm also ASD but figure I could be Schizotypal instead or both. 

Is there any possibility this is normal childhood development? Or is this a clear sign of schizophrenia for him?

How much does marital stress affect him and the possibility of developing full blow schizophrenia?

What is the likelihood that this was caused by drugs next door? The guy is verbally abusive to his girlfriend and he's just not a good person. Leaves shit on the sidewalk with his two dogs for people to step on everyday for example. And he's just not a well kept looking person. I called the fire department to investigate the smell because it was so powerful. They told them it was oven cleaner and they believed it. So I wrote the drug thing off. We are no longer living ther. 

I just want to protect my baby boy and give him the best chance for success in life. He's such a smart and good hearted boy. After him telling me this I'm going to call the doctor and schedule an appointment as well.

"I don't want to reveal too much information, but I want some input.

Brother and I are close in age. He developed symptoms in his early 20's, mostly paranoia. I knew immediately something was off, told my parents about it. They didn't believe me, or more specifically they didn't want to believe it was true. Schizophrenia runs in the family, so I get it.

Mid 20's he had a super crazy episode. Combination of jail and state hospital for about 7-8 years.

When he was released, it took him some time to get back to a normal life. It's been years since he was released, never witnessed any past or new behavior that were paranoia/auditory/visual hallucinations.

Last night, my brother and I decided to drink some beer. Obviously, its not good to mix his med with drugs/alcohol. Ultimately, he's an adult, if he wants to drink he'll do it with or without me. Very rarely will I drink with him, our work schedules are very different. Anyways, we went to the store to buy a 6 pack of beer.

I stayed in the car, he went inside to buy it. When he left the store, I could see him staring hyper focused in a specific location. Hes currently married, going through a shit separation. I figured he recognized one of her family members or something. I asked him about it, and he just said he thought he recognized someone. I pressed on it, and he said they kept staring at him. 

We start to drive away, but he is still maintaining focus in that direction. Pulling away very slowly. He then rolls down the window and stared into this other car for what felt like inappropriately too long. I see it's two young adults, probably dating. He insists they where staring at him. I try to tell him the women was probably just checking him out, he is attractive after all and wouldn't be shocking.

We park at our house, and start to drink in the car while listening to music. He brings up buying guns. He's always had a fascination with guns, knives, camping gear, whatever. I know, red flag. It's not really unusual for our family to talk about that kind of stuff.  But it's more like ""oh hey I saw this YouTube video, check it out. Isn't that cool! "" ""Yeah that is cool, remember that scene from this movie"" "" yeah I remember"". It's like South Park 'member berries shit.... Nothing serious or even remotely alarming.

He mentioned he wanted to buy guns and bury them in the backyard. I try to bring things down and say thats a waste of money, you wouldn't even be allowed to use them. Now Everyone in my family is a Christian and believes in all that rapture shit. I don't. So I'm over here thinking it's just religious bullshit.


So we drop the subject. He asks if I have seen his Rambo knife.  He shows it to me, it's just some generic balanced large throwing knife. Nothing special, he puts it away and we continue talking. He asks if I could pass it to him again. I'm like ""sure, he probably just wants to play with it... Fidget spinner stuff, to keep his hands busy.""

He then unsheathed it, and gripped it in a way that could seriously hurt someone. Then he does the dang hyper focused stare out the front window. I'm honestly scared at this moment, because it starts to bring up flashbacks. I'm not scared that he's going to hurt me, I was just scared of how it would effect him and the rest of the family if he had another serious episode.

There's some guy jogging down the street, in our direction, on our side. He then fucking rolls down the window and starts looking paranoid as fuck. I recognize that its just some highschool kid jogging. I tell him to close the window, it's just some kid, there's no reason to even think something like that condensing we live in a very nice neighborhood. Leave your doors unlocked at night type

I immediately tell him that shit wasn't cool, that it was definitely paranoid behavior. That I don't ever want to see that again. I try to tell him, I don't care if you still have symptoms..I just don't want you to be put away again. I tell him he could talk to me, I'll keep it between us. That I don't judge him or look down on him, etc. Consoling family deal you know? After that was deescalated, I told him I need to go to sleep since I have to wake up at 4 a.

I just keep getting this feeling that he's going to spiral out. Condensing his separation is very ugly, drinking, etc. I almost want to tell our parents about it, because I just don't even know how to deal with this again. At the same time I want to confront him, and try to reassure him. I just feel at a loss.",Schizophrenia

"I don't believe that all substances are beneficial for those who suffer from psychosis. I'd never condone a drug such as psilocybin that makes one hallucinate. Schizophrenics already hallucinate. 

I do not, however, believe there is anything wrong with consuming alcohol while experiencing symptoms. I'm not alone in this. I'm a part of a schizophrenic friend/support group. When we video chat, guess what we have? Alcohol. All of us. It was never suggested. We just did it. 

I've heard a number of testimonials as to why this helps each individual. For me, it's anxiety. I also numb the PTSD-like symptoms that I experience from memories of being psychotic. Other people have told me that it relieves their negative symptoms. Whatever helps them cope. 

Marijuana is a tricky one. Some schizos smoke. Others can not. It's up to each individual to make the right choice for themselves.

All but one of my standard metrics of cognition used to be in the severely low category, within range of the lowest number of some. There was one that was above average and remains a huge strength, meanwhile all of the others have risen to pre-psychosis levels. In fact, I now believe some of them to have improved beyond pre-psychosis levels in a case of Post-Traumatic Growth. My art and my faith (Hermetic Pagan) have given me the tools to rebuild my life and now I'm on track to graduate with honours and consider a master's.  

I'm involved in mental health research and education as a youth advisor on a few projects and I know this has been a long post but I believe that it is important for people to know that they can recover. Resilience, resilience, resilience... Don't let that daimon get you down. Blessed be.",Schizophrenia

"Hello there.

I used to be a normal sleeper (8 hours average, no trouble sleeping) but since my diagnosis and particularly since starting on Risperidone I have found that I need so much sleep. I will happily sleep for up to 12 hours before I feel rested. I also experience frequent trouble falling and staying asleep.

I'm wondering if anyone else has exprienced this.",Schizophrenia
"Now, I don't have schizophrenia but I have had dissociative psychotic breaks from CPTSD, and decided to post this here because many people can relate.

Further down the line, how much should I share with potential friends about my past psychotic episodes? Would they feel as threated if it's something I'm not currently experiencing? I'm overall not sure how judgmental people are about *past* mental health issues, are they pretty much a nonfactor from your experience with others?",Schizophrenia
"I'm 18, and my psychosis has been intensifying for the last two years. For a while, it was just an issue with mid to long-term memory. Now I've been really struggling with short-term recall. If I'm not actively trying to remember or take note of something it will immediately escape me. I'm wondering if anyone else has a similar experience and if anyone has some good ways to manage this?",Schizophrenia
"Today I went out and bought some sushi. Just got home. Peer coaching has not contacted me with a client for three weeks now so I am considering volunteering instead. I emailed several places but so far, only the homeless shelter got back to me. It's to help kids with homework. One problem is that I'm not comfortable with everyone there. Some of them might be rude/unmedicated, etc. Without my mom around, I keep feeling paranoid that I might do something wrong. I've been taking the bus out during the day since my dad has been kind of a grouch lately.

"I haven't worked since late 2019. Nearly 3 years of just sitting in my room listening to music and watching netflix all day every day. I'm not getting any younger. Late 30s now. The plan was to take about 2 years off and to to college as a mature student studying medical physics (I'm a physicist and mathematician). But I'm not well enough and don't know if I could hack a job in that line. Will the same thing happen to me again just having a breakdown and leaving work. I've been thinking of going on permanent disability but there's very little money. It would be a struggle to live week to week.

"Basically I have been going downhill the last week and a half. They say I am becoming more psychotic every day and my depression came up again. My parents are worrying and they called everyone for help. I had a breakdown and hurt the people I love. This resulted in the police showing up at my house and taking me to the psych ward. This is the 20th time in the last 2 years.

"My bf (21M) and I (21F) have been involved for nearly 3 years. We were in a casual relationship for about a year with a break in between. During the break a lot happened but the main thing is that he dealt with a psychotic break and got diagnosed schizo. We got back together but things have not been the same since, especially the sex. He has trouble staying hard which I know now has to do with his mental state, his delusions interfering, and possibly his meds. However, because of the shame I presume he has been feeling due to his impotence, he began blaming me for not being hot enough or feeling good enough or the sex just being plain bad. I do everything to keep him satisfied and I know he enjoyed me during our relationship prior to his psychotic break so I've come to terms with all these reasons being projection, especially considering we have talked these things over. I know he's been able to get into it recently, maybe not everytime which I am patient with, but whenever he feels ashamed again he goes back to blaming me, comparing me to other girls, and talking badly about my performance in bed behind my back. All the while, I've witnessed many times how dissociative he can get and how disordered his thinking can be as he continues to struggle with delusions unrelated to this topic. Due to this, I feel pretty confident saying that these projections are part of his delusional state and disordered thinking as well. 
I am working on moving past the insecurities these projections have caused and he has been working on not making me feel bad about his shortcomings. Lately it's just been so hard since he gets triggered whenever I bring up the things he's said in the past in order to get reassurance. I know I need to stop but I also don't want him to continue projecting. I know his mental state is pretty fucked but does this ever go away? Is this normal? I know his behavior has been pretty bad but I want to have faith that these things will fix if he puts in the work? Anyone have a situation similar while in psychosis or in a relationship with someone going through psychosis? I just want advice on how to move forward. I feel like I am losing my boyfriend to this illness",Schizophrenia

"Tbh i really miss my mom and I'm honestly just lost on what to do, she's not diagnosed or anything but there's little to no doubt in my mind that she is schizophrenic. TW for everything because idek where to start. So a bit over two weeks ago my mom had a psychotic episode, there were many signs that something was going prior to the episode  but I'm 16 and how was i supposed to know what to do? Thursday August 25th of this year is when it really started getting bad; my grandma had come over to have dinner, and my mom and grandma started arguing over something that happened many years ago. I was there and watched it all unfold, I've never ever seen my grandma get so frustrated. She left but I was supposed to go with her because I was going to stay the night with her, I talked to my mom and I asked her if she still wanted me to go with her and she said yes so I did. From my point of view my grandma was in the wrong and tbh I had begun to hate her from everything my mom had been saying, I later talked to my grandma about this and most of it was not true. The next day I went to school and it was pretty normal until I got into the car and the environment felt cold and hushed. I asked what was wrong and they refused to answer me. What worried me was when my brother started crying (my mom had told him that he was going to die Thursday night) and i had no way of contacting my parents because apparently their phones had both broken and when i finally got in contact with my dad he said that something very serious had happened. When my dad picked me up my parents were talking about how my family moving forward is going to have a new life and were going to follow god even more now. We got to my uncles house (he's also my church's pastor) and when we got off my dad collected my phone and my brothers. When we were in the house they sent my siblings (two brothers and one sister, all younger then me) to another room and they sat me down on the couch and my mom started talking to me about my diary- for context i was struggling a lot with depression and self harm, I'm trans and I'm dating a trans person and my whole family is extremely transphobic, and my dad had tried to leave my family multiple times- and I used my diary to vent about all my problems or to talk about how much I love my girlfriend. My mom started yelling at me and a lot went down but basically what told me something much worse was going on was when she looked at me dead in the eyes and told me she was not my mother or (insert my moms name) and that she was actually Jesus, at this point i knew it was psychosis. When we all sat down to eat something (most of us haven't eaten anything for a while, especially my mom) my mom kept rambling about a bunch of different delusions but most went along the lines of everyone's trying to kill my mother and myself and they're trying to take my dad and brother from her and that my uncles were some demonic beings and that they were about to overdose. I talked to my dad and i tried to explain that we need to take her to the hospital right now and he refused. So we all tried to get some sleep hoping that that was the end of it and that we all just need rest. I woke up at 5 in the morning to my mom screaming and cussing (my mom never even says the word stupid) and my uncle, aunt and dad screaming/ praying. Around 8ish she stopped screaming and my grandma/ grandpa were here and we all hugged and I really didn't want to let go of her; she always came to me about everything that happened and i loved talking to her. We went to my grandmas house and I was really happy that it was over, in reality it was just the beginning. Around 15 minutes of being there she began screaming again and her delusions were even worse. We came to the conclusion that what was causing this was one of the following: a supplement she bought on Facebook, trama (what I thought it was), and a test from god (what my dad thought it was). I ended up going to CVS to get a drug test and something came back positive for something (I dont remember what it was but its known to cause psychosis and i saw narcan show up when i google searched it). The timeline so far is: Thursday night it started, Friday I get yelled at and I realize that she is going through psychosis (i forgot to mentioned that she tried off herself by trying to jump out a car in motion while i was in school), Saturday she continues to scream for hours at a time and only stopping for 10-20 minutes but continues talking about all her delusions or she falls asleep from physical exhaustion and she gets drug tested. Everyone except my dad agrees to take her to the hospital (i was trying to convince him to take her but it was really hard because he refused to leave her side and i couldn't see her because the last time i did she tried to me throw up to â€˜get rid of the lesbian spirit') but he finally gives in and takes her to the hospital on Sunday morning at 7am where the hospital simply goes â€˜we gave her something to calm down and she doesn't have any drugs so bye' WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. She had tried to fucking off herself a few days before. But after that she stops sceaming and basically just sleeps a lot and talks about her delusions. The next day I go  to school and my mom is taken to the doctor where she is told to stop the medicine and that the medicine should be out of her system in 1-2 weeks but here we are two weeks later and she is still having delusions and is very paranoid and idk what to do . My dad said that he wanted to take her to see a professional but idk if he still does because the pastor or the prophet as she calls herself says that this was a test from god, she doesn't know what i do and no one understands everything fully like me because ive been the person she vents to for years and i know that she needs to see a professional ASAP because this doesn't seem  to be a one time thing and i dont want it to be too late when everyone else realizes that- she was so close to  offing herself just a few days ago and she isn't getting enough sleep. Even if she isn't schizophrenic she definitely needs to see a professional and i was thinking about talking about it with my school's guidance counsellor or my therapist but I'm scared to do anything about this. It's almost 3 in the morning and i have to wake up at 5 for school where ill have two quizzes i was supposed to take last week and i still haven't studied for any of them. 

TLDR: my mom had a psychosis episode which was thought to be caused by some medicine, we were told to wait 1-2 weeks for things to get better and although she isn't hallucinating and screaming things are definitely not normal but my dad thinks this is spiritual so idk how to get her the help that she needs.",Schizophrenia

It's expensive, but maybe it'll lead to some cool fashion trends. I don't want to do this anymore! Also it feels like many people don't think the same way as me. They sided against me for a variety of reasons, most notably being poor, being more drawn to dark magic than light magic. I personally never really dabbled in much dark magic. Created an idea for a level of Hell where it's just blue apartment rooms and you have a small daily schedule and live there being small until your time is done... but you won't be quite the same as if you never had to go depending on how long you're there for. I also think people who aren't too bad can go to some â€œschoolâ€ versions of Hell to gain skills while doing time. My class is more about Westernization, the reversal of Mao era policies. I also sometimes have other minor uses for dark magic like giving people bad luck, losing 50 cents, etc. I miss the guy I like.

"Hi I'm undiagnosed and was wondering if this is schizophrenia or just symptoms of my major depression and anxiety disorders since I'm aware that they overlap. I'm also autistic if it matters. 
since I can remember I've had feelings of being watched and followed (I remember feeling like I was being followed while walking to school) and monitored (like someone was seeing my phone and computer with some kind of app and recorinf what I'm doing on those) and feeling presences in my room/outside my window watching me. I've hallucinated bugs as well (both visually and tactile) and just the thought of roaches makes me feel like they're in my room and I start feeling really dirty and disgusting . 
Recently I had an episode that was triggered by a YouTube horror video and it got so bad I had to hide under my covers despite being summer and being too hot and sweaty but feeling like I could not even show my face from under the covers or I'd be in danger and couldn't sleep for hours (episodes like this one have happened before.)

I wonder if I've become too hardened mentally to really take in what's around me. I have a feeling people have been stalking me.

"There is value that can come from talking to a friend who has gone through psychosis. It can hold more value than professional therapy. 

Of course, if you feel you need a professional therapist, seek one out. 

However, their answers will be text book. A high functioning psychotic friend can actually empathize with what it's like to have a psychic conversation with the tv. They can tell you what it's like to feel as those others can read their thoughts. It's infinitely helpful to have a loved one know exactly what you're going through. The best part? It's free. 

I would highly recommend seeking out fellow sufferers of psychosis over paying someone to listen to you and have them give you answers word for word from a book. 

Again, seek any resources you think will help you. In my opinion, you're better off talking to a high functioning psychotic friend. I know I'm not alone in this. It's why so many online support groups exist.

"It is often the case that schizos run to the ward whenever they feel the slightest bit unstable. This can often do more harm than good. 

The ward is a place where you can feel institutionalized if you stay there long enough. 

Reasons to go to the ward? You feel you are such a danger to yourself and others that you need to be locked away and given medication immediately. If you feel that you can wait for outpatient treatment, it is best to go that route. Meds are what is going to help you. Medical prison will not. 

Outpatient help is the way to go if you feel you can wait to get medicated.

So once upon a time my last real rush of an episode was going on my first time living alone. I get several different voices speaking some absolutely atrocious things.

"Hello ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm not a diagnosed schizophrenic. I'm a 19 year old male about to go to uni living in the UK. I have ADHD as well. My family has had a history of schizophrenia on the male side especially with my dad. I really just need some advice at the moment. I have been consulting my psychiatrist and have been put on antipsychotics (olanzapine) but I really just want to get the opinion of the schizophrenic community.
About two months ago I took quite a high dose of Acid for the second time. It was an absolutely terrifying experience where I went into a psychotic episode and nearly ended up killing myself. I have posted about that before on the lsd subreddit. Over the last two months I have been experiencing increasing number of pro dominantly visual hallucinations with the occasional auditory hallucination. They are usually insects like wasps and spiders everywhere, people standing around at far distances or objects looking extremely like people  standing around only for them to disappear moments later. I also see patterns like faces and lsd patterns and faces everywhere all the time in the carpets to the trees and in the clouds. I can only describe some of my periods as like being on another acid trip, which lead me to believe I had hppd for a long time.
I did get into the anxiety spiral of fear of schizophrenia as described in this forums intro. Although that does not seem to be the extent of my issues. My hallucinations seem heavily dependent on my mood and thought process. I can only describe it as flicking between two mindsets where they are very extreme from each other.
In terms of delusions, when I walk past people on the street I get intense fear that makes me start to shake as I think they might stab be or come after me. I sometimes hear people or see people following me at night. I also think that people are attracted to me all the time when I speak to them and if I say no to them or don't lead them on then they will hurt me. I also fear my psychiatrist sometimes or I will fear my friends will alienate me because I start seeing insects which will make me become quiet as I end up in my own head.
Although, most of the time I know the delusions are delusional and am able to ignore them. However sometimes the fear is to much and they overpower me. I would say I am incredibly aware that my hallucinations are hallucinations although sometimes I scare myself as I just don't know that what i just sore was real or not. 
Sometimes I get into places where I am suicidal as I can't get out of the fear which triggers more hallucinations and I fear I will be stuck in that moment forever with these demon creatures in my head. 
My head has been getting more and more scrambled and foggy as time goes on. It's so hard to even talk to people which makes me worry about socialising even though I'm quite extroverted. I would say I have quite strong control over my thought process and I can ignore the hallucinations and stop myself falling into thought spirals.
I feel that I'm sort of at the end of this episode but I fear the future especially with the uncertainty of going to uni.
If anyone is still reading then thanks and any opinion would be great. I am not asking for any diagnosis just some advice.",Schizophrenia

Especially asking menstruating people: Is this normal anxiety about a late period or something more?

My period is around 2 weeks late and I am 110% convinced that I am pregnant.  I am sexually active, but I always use protection and have had no accidents with that.  I have taken 2 pregnancy tests and they were both negative, but I think I took them wrong like I peed not enough or too much on the stick.  I am fully obsessed and terrified about what to do with this information like I can't stop thinking about being pregnant, I keep panic attacking because I need to terminate a pregnancy and I don't really want to but it's not the right time and my meds are teratogenic and I don't take care of myself and I wouldn't be a good parent, etc.  I can't focus at all on any of my schoolwork or anything important because I am obsessed with and distracted by thoughts of pregnancy and the need for pregnancy termination.  There actually is a logical reason outside of pregnancy for why I have a late period, but I don't really believe it and I still think I'm pregnant.

"Hi! Im a student whose team won an international inventing competition. Our invention was the ""Schizo-Band"" (forgive the name plz ðŸ˜­) and we are going to create a prototype but before that a professor advised us to talk to people who actually have schizophrenia as none of us do. 

The Schizo-Band is basically a headband which alerts the user that they are experiencing hallucinations (mainly auditory as the band is located nearest to the sensory cortex). It has electrodes attached to it so it can recognise hallucinations by their abnormal brainwaves like an ECG of sorts. It looks completely normal from the outside, like a headband. It also occasionally sends reports to your doctor esp when there's a particularly bad episode.

"I have spent several hours reading about SCZ and have some observations and questions about a friend who has the condition. I noticed recurring themes of karma or paranoia, status, achievements and delusions. Paragraphs are numbered for ease of reference. Any comments would be appreciated.

1. (achievements) He plays alot of computer games and often posts screenshots of his achievements in our small whatsapp group (4 people). The thing is, none of us are familiar with these games. Seems like he is looking for positive affirmations or recognition? Is it possible he may hear voices (auditory hallucinations) that tell him he is worthless, not good enough, or needs to achieve something? 

2. (time is valuable) Over a year ago my friend invited me to his place to play some chess. He seemed extremely tense, like it was a matter of life and death. In the end he beat me easily and was actually disappointed that I was no challenge for him. I was really offended at the time, but I soon realized it was probably his illness that influenced his behavior. I noticed he tends to view his time as very valuable. 

3. (karma) he once made some comments about what he calls ""downtrodden"" people which he said accounts for at least 1/4 of the population. He basically said their circumstances were the result of previous bad karma, such as criminal activity, unfortunate health problem (this surprised me), money problems, gambling problems, wrong work or life choices. 

I noticed that if someone in our whatsapp group talks too much about something negative, like a serious health condition, that can trigger him to leave the group, only to apologize the next day and ask to be added back. Assuming he views anyone with serious health problems as having bad karma that could rub off on him? 

4. (paranoia/karma) Another time, he left the group after someone criticized the CCP about the disappearance of the Chinese tech entrepreneur, Jack Ma. 

5. (grandiose delusions) Said a HP executive sent him an email about future technology. In the past when asked how his work was going, he would say that his job is very important and was high status. 

6. (grandiose delusions/karma) He previously had a Twitter account where he posted Microsoft Windows computer tips. Many of the tips were seemingly very mundane and not worth mentioning. I don't understand what the purpose was. Perhaps he has a delusion about being a ""technology messenger"" or sees giving tips as accumulating positive karma?? 

7. (karma?) One time, shortly after leaving the whatsapp group due to #3 above, he sent the remaining two group members an email asking them if they wanted some IT tech tips to contact him.",Schizophrenia

"Hello again. I was told in the message to introduce myself and so i will.

So im 35 y/o now, female and suffering from paranoid schizophrenia since 2014-ish... Thats the first time i was diagnosed as such anyways.
Before that i struggled already in my youth because of a family issue where i got diagnosed at 16 years with borderline personality disorder and schizoaffective disorder. I also took depression meds for the following years which didnt really seem to have an affect on my mood so i quit them.
The schizophrenia really seriously kicked in at age 26, when i came back from a very disappointing 6 month trip to India. It was shortly thereafter that i traveled from my calm, peaceful farmtown to Italys capital, Rome, where i experienced my first severe psychosis. I was there alone, living in a b&amp;b, having major delusions, hallucinations (auditory, visual, sensory), fear, panik, terror 24/7. I thought i am fighting off demons who want me to kill myself. I tried at one point... It was traumatizing. I have lots of stories from that experience like when i was almost kidnapped in the middle of the night... Or when i yelled out that i am possessed by the devil during a church service... Or when i performed questionable ""shamanic rituals"" to exorcise the demon within me... Or when i hid in the hospital as to escape certain death. 

Anyways, i was saved by a total miracle then when a stranger invited me into a restaurant late at night. I hadnt eaten in a week or so, no water, no shower and i had a towel wrapped arround my waist instead of pants. Inside they gave me food and water and i told them that ""satan is haunting me"" to which they called the authorities. They took me to the psych ward and ultimately helped me sleep by injecting God-knows-what-exactly... I was so afraid i thought if i sleep i cant defend myself n ill die.

The following days i was like a ghost. Not speaking, no reaction at all to things. I was so totally lost because of all the trauma i experienced. It was a state of an overwhelmed disbelief at everything.

After that i spend 2 years in a community for ppl with psychological issues. I took my meds religiously and didnt drink or take any other substances. Slowly but surely i recovered...

Until i didnt.

One day i made the stupid decision to stop my meds. Thats when psychosis 2 hit me. It began slowly as it does and hyped itself up to me losing control over my own thoughts, telling me the worst things immaginable that ""they"" are gonna make me do. I experienced mostly the same delusions and hallucinations. I also had terrible, insane visions about things i cant even put into words. And i was still performing rituals to drive out the evil. No one noticed the war inside my mind...

Ultimately i wound up in psychiatry again where with the right medication the madness stopped. I was still and maybe still am sus of my own mind. Like i cannot trust it. Like it is my enemy. The enemy within me...

5 years passed. I was stable for that time bcs again i took my meds religiously. I think i have to take them for the rest of my life and honestly, even tho im not the biggest fan of that, i am so thankful they even exist as an option and by God - will not quit ever again bcs im too afraid of the illness now.

Before all this happened, and now since few months again, i do meditation which helps. Often i have very significant dreams that show me that im on the right way. Ive become somewhat of a nihilist tho whereas before i was super spiritual loving the universe and being loved back. I miss that version of me everytime im sad about how my life turned out... I dont have it as bad tho. I married in febuary to a very understanding, patient man. My condition is under control mostly besides intrusive memories from psychosis. I dont want to complain bcs i know some have it worse...

During psychosis i swore to free us all schizophrenics who fight battles ""normal ppl"" cannot even begin to grasp. I swore to be there in a sign, in a song, in a moment of relief; as a helping hand or a shoulder to cry on... I wish we didnt have to suffer this terrible illness...

Lately - as for myself - ive realized alot. The delusions, the ego trip to be the chosen one, the rituals i performed... It was all nonsense. The mkultra or being remote controlled, the telepathy, the signs everywhere, the aliens or multidimensional reptilian overlords.............. 
It was all an elaborate ""trick"" of the illness to make me go mad and hopefully off myself ultimately. I am not possessed by demons and i am not special in a major significant way. 
I much rather believe the illness takes chunks of information from whatever we read or heard or seen at some point during our whole lives and makes a ""mindfuck"" out of all that possibly taking that also from the collective unconscious. Thats why so many of us share similar or the same delusions and even if u have never heard of the governments secret projects of mindcontrol many will feel that this must be it... Idk tho, its just another theory. 

The mind is a powerful thing.

I am not speaking because all my muscles in my body are twitching, include my throat making my voice sound weird, my jaw is twitching making my temples contract, and my legs are shaking. We arrive in class and get back to work. I cannot think straight. I keep feeling the illusion that i am not really there.
In class, i am surrounded by students and the teacher is glancing at me. I am shaking too much. I wait it out and immediately leave school half way through the day and walk home. I am starting to calm down.

My brother and uncle are both schizophrenic. This game me the thought that i might be having a psychotic episode. I have been clean for a year and half. When i did drugs, ive done shrooms and weed. Prehaps this unlocked a psychotic disorder. This is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me. Thanks for reading.",Schizophrenia
"Hey Guys,

it all started with a massive Fear of Death because i came unfortunately in a bad situation.

I visited a friend with another friend thats a cop, but we were just there to visit a friend.

Than another Guy came in and we all know that this guy is dealing with maybe cocaine and other stuff and he is always very weird. If he is with you in a room you feel some coldness because i think he can be dangerousâ€¦we recognized that this was for all a bad situation. i think he feeled like we are spy him or something like that. i get very anxious in this moment and after that he wanted to talk with me and i thought maybe im done :( however he said he just wanted to talk with me and nothing happensâ€¦till then i started to get fear in the night that im gonna get killedâ€¦.it was like i was catastrophical and every night was horrorâ€¦.than another event happened and anotherâ€¦than the ukrainian war began and i freaked out that we all gonna die in a nuclear warâ€¦.

my whole life crashed and i started crying everyday when i wake up because i have so much fear for everythingâ€¦i also have depression since then and im always very agitated and crying all day over the same thingsâ€¦every person looks evil now for me and i am completely isolatedâ€¦.i just have my girlfriend and im feeling like paralyzed saying all day : its over, i cant any longer, its so heavy, help help helpâ€¦.i cant concentrate any longer and i feel like the world is living without meâ€¦really numb and have a bad headacheâ€¦i cant describe itâ€¦it feels like my eyes are paralyzedâ€¦and when i go to supermarket it is hell for meâ€¦.im just heavy anxious, jittery and think all persons are evilâ€¦i want to cry in the supermarkt.

What are you think about that? i thought i have just a major depressionâ€¦but this is another level :( im also suicidal because i cant take this pain :( 

When i take a ativan, the heavy anxiety leaves and im able to talk. but there is still this feeling like world is not real and the depression symptoms still there. but the crying and the permanently repeating of how bad everything is stops.

what do you think :( ?",Schizophrenia

"It's a well known fact that roughly less than 10% of schizophrenics maintain a full time job. I used to make a lot of money, the exact amount isn't important, but enough to support myself and a family. Unfortunately I came down with bipolar schizoaffective, delusions, hallucinations, countless involuntary hospitalizations, and a gradual decline in my functioning. I take seroquel like 800mg and have tried many other anti-psychotics. I have learned the hard way that schizophrenia and employment do not go well together. So fast forward, I am on long term disability after onset of my last psychotic episode. Soon, that runs out, and I'm still trying to get approved for SSDI.

My dad paid for my health insurance up until recently. I've been financially independent. I told him I'm going to need his help as I am disabled now. This is like my worst nightmare. So my dad made like $80,000,000 last year. He says he'll â€œhelp me financiallyâ€ and offers to give me less money a month than a minimum wage worker in a big city would make. He tells me health insurance is a privilege and cuts off my health insurance actually. This is not good as I've had over $300,000 in medical bills covered by my insurance recently and lots of psych hospitalizations. He abuses me verbally, and curses me out over using a special needs trust with my assets and tells me he's paying for my medical pills which is not even true. He told everyone in my family I had a substance induced psychosis which is flat out not true. I've been diagnosed by countless board-certified psychiatrists with chronic schizophrenia or Schizoaffective who all know my history. I've done electric convulsive therapy and I still can't get to a point where I can work. My dad basically tells me that I gave myself this illness with drug use and that it's too bad if my life sucks now and I can't afford basic necessities because I chose to do drugs at one point in my life. The verbal abuse never stops. I'm constantly reminded of how â€œout thereâ€ my delusions have been and how crazy I am. At this point I feel like I have PTSD-C if that's even possible from ongoing abuse. I graduated top of my class at a top 50 business school and was a top software sales rep, and then I had onset of schizophrenia and slowly deteriorated while all of my â€œfriendsâ€ ditched me because they were embarassed of my delusions. I spent money like crazy in a manic episode too. I just watched my life go down hill so fast and there's nothing I can do to fight back it feels like and the people I called my family actually aren't there for me in times of a crisis and deny I'm even disabled. I can't work because of so many issues Schizo has caused. I've lost everything including my own hygiene.

Has anyone here been through something like this? Am I in the wrong or is my parent really greedy? How do you deal with this? Any advice for any of these situations?

I have a great gf too but I'm scared if I can't provide for her she is going to have to leave me. I love this girl so much, and want to start a family with her. I'm really drained, embarrassed, &amp; depressed. It makes me paranoid to even post this.",Schizophrenia
"I took 8mg Perphenazine for a couple years with relatively easy side effects and recently added 37 mg Latuda in efforts to try switching to Latuda completely because I still had bad anxiety, which I would connect with added stress factors and trauma, but of course psychiatry thinks every bad emotion is a schizophrenia symptom and needs a better AP. Soon I started to experience almost constant tension on my forehead and I catch myself tensing my face a lot. I don't think it's an anxiety symptom since I've had a lot of anxiety in the past but it never did this.

Doctor said that this might be the combination of these two meds and I should still switch to Latuda, but she has been dismissive about side effects before too. I'm just afraid that if I keep this up and eat Latuda longer and up the dose too, this will be a permanent thing. I'm just so fucking scared of these medications, I had the same effect even more severely when trying to switch to Rxulti and other side effects too so I stopped that experimentation too. Doctor said that I probably wasn't the medication even though involuntary movements are a possible side effect in every AP I've ever heard of and I never had that problem before. I really don't know what I should do.",Schizophrenia

"It's just not right. I have delusions that there is an underclass of humans that donate organs every night and live at the hospital then during the day they go out to work or activities and are treated to material things. Most of these people live in China. It's mostly white people. I have some white mentally ill friends and I thought they were cool but maybe they secretly discriminate as well. Why? Why do so many people, even the damned, think this is a good idea? I feel betrayed by all these people I thought were nice enough to friend someone with schizophrenia. That said, I don't want to let this drag on.  I want to get married one dayâ€¦ don't know what comes after that. How can we be together when such terrible things are happening. I have family in China but they are mostly upper class. I feel like I play a role in all this. I'm starting to look a bit more tired and hair is falling out. I'm 31. There's nothing I can do at the present time but I want to learn more about this underclass and if it's worth helping all of them. I don't think considering yourself better than the underclass is too concerning as long as you didn't do anything to hurt them. I just want this horror show to end.",Schizophrenia
"Hello- my husbands friend has schizophrenia. He's currently staying in some kind of a home with roommates.
Before he went into the home he was on his medication and seemed to be doing okay, but since then he seems to not be taking the medication.
He keeps calling me and he is talking either in another language or unable to form a coherent sentence.

"Schizoaffective diagnosed with extreme anxiety/agoraphobia and some OCD in the mix for fun.

I have been seeing my therapist for 3 months. Since then my mental health has absolutely tanked. My therapist is, on a good day, somewhat helpful. On a bad day, condescending. She made fun of the fact that I struggled with disordered eating (said that she could never have an eating disorder and that she loves food too much) and then tried to tell me I was self diagnosing and I was dumb for doing that. 

She's made fun of my agoraphobia (telling me I'm not agoraphobic I'm just insecure about my body and have social anxiety) and told me I'm not really schizophrenic. (I am diagnosed and medicated by a psychiatrist). 

I have since had to up my depression medication and I'm so stressed I fell into a manic episode 3 weeks ago. I have been struggling to go to appointments for my therapist and my case manager because of my depression. And they have done nothing but guilted me about it. They keep harassing me and shame me when I do finally show up.

I know it's not just me because I always go to my psych appointment on time and have generally no issues, my psych is very kind, compassionate and is always patient with me. 

Mentally I'm really down today and I can't handle it, I don't want to get hospitalized because of MY OWN care team. 

On top of that I had an appointment today with my case manager and she just badgered at me about not answering her phone call earlier in the week (I was in class and I just forgotten to call her back), and when she asked me about how I was doing in school, and I told her I got a great score on my exam; she just used that opportunity to tell me about how good she was in the subject and how it would be easy for ANYONE.

I'm currently enrolled and recently dropped out of one course, because it was a bit too much for me to handle. Especially, when my cognitive functions just decide not to work at that time. It didn't really help that the course was very overwhelming and what really broke me was when after the class ended. I was very confused on where I even was.

"I've been dealing with a minor health scare that's stressing me out and making me anxious. I think this triggered a minor delusion today. I went to Chipotle for dinner. For a brief moment I thought my food was poisoned. I immediately fought the delusion and quickly accepted that it wasn't poisoned. This triggered a sudden wave of the persecutory delusions I used to have (being poisoned). This lasted only a few seconds thankfully. I fought this tooth and nail, and I just ate my food and left. I felt fine afterwards.

Then a few minutes ago I was thinking about that poisoning delusion, and I had another brief moment of delusional thinking (only a few seconds). I quickly convinced myself it wasn't true.

I'm kind of freaking out about this. I've been trying to leave the house more to do more ""normal"" things. But this is just causing tons of flashbacks and these brief moments of delusional thinking. I'm not sure what to do.",Schizophrenia
"This summer, schizophrenia hit hard force. The biggest delusion I had was that I was Princess Diana's daughter or had some connection to the royal family.
Normally, I don't follow the news in the U.K. and this delusion came from the predictive text on my phone.

Some scary parts about my delusion though, were that I knew things about Princess Diana that I never knew before until I researched it today because of Queen Elizabeth II's death.

Number 1: My predictive text kept telling me there was an issue with me marrying a Muslim. As I researched more today, I learned the boyfriend of Princess Diana was an Egyptian Muslim and they were both in the crash in 1997. I read different theories as to why that would be a change in the English Monarchy had Prinncess Diana married him.
 
Number 2: I convinced myself this summer that my sore thigh was because it was Princess Diana speaking to me about her injuries in the car crash. Then today I learned that she suffered a cut thigh. The only difference was that mine was on the left and hers was on the right.

Number 3: a huge recurring element of my summers thoughts of Princess Diana were that she loved a white wine with lavender. Today, I searched if she drank and I found that she didn't drink too much, but she preferred the puligny montrachet. A white wine.

All in all, I think that even though I have schizophrenia, I have somehow connected my life with Princess Diana's. I was born in 1995, but I don't think I'm her daughter.",Schizophrenia

Or the hallucination will seem normal to me at the time and I won't feel the need to keep staring, like when I saw horses made of smoke running through a field.

"Hi, I'm new to this Subreddit and I've come with a question that's been on my mind for almost five years: Can paranoid delusions take the form of false memories?

Some background - For about five years I've been dealing with extremely paranoid thoughts that I am under surveillance by people who want to kill me. These thoughts usually start when I VIVIDLY recall instances of people telling me that the FBI is out to get me, and the same people tell me now that those conversations never happened.

I've done my research on schizophrenia and paranoid delusions but I've never found any cases like mine. It seems like most cases of schizophrenia involve delusions about things that are happening now or in the future, not past experiences.

"I am 19 years old and I do not have schizophrenia or any other diagnosed psychotic disorder. 

I am asking this question because I have been having experiences with weed that I have never heard of happening before. 

I am posting this question here because schizophrenia is my biggest fear when it comes to my weed use, and because I do not know much about my family history on my mothers side which worries me because she struggled a lot with pretty severe unidentified mental illness.

Experiences that worry me:
1. While I am on weed, if and only if I have been smoking daily for a while (2+ weeks) and have built a moderate tolerance, I will get a feeling of pressure in my head (mostly behind my forehead and on the top of my head). This pressure ranges from slightly uncomfortable all the way to searing sharp pain depending on how much I smoke. I should note that if I have not been smoking recently and do not have a tolerance, I don't get the feeling at all no matter how much I smoke in one session. The feeling will fade over the course of 24-48 hours. 

2. I have recently noticed changes in my mood that are subtle but noticeable. I have become both more apathetic and anhedonic in the past few weeks. I have struggled with these things growing up, but usually there is some kind of specific trigger and it gets better as I change my environment and mindset. This time there is no clear trigger or sign of improvement.

3. I haven't started hearing things necessarily, but I've noticed an increased tendency to mishear sounds. I will hear a backpack zipper moving and perceive it as someone saying â€œHeyâ€, before thinking for a second and realizing what it really was. 

I am mostly concerned about #1, which is why Id like to ask this subreddit if any of you have had a similar experience with weed. Additionally, what differences in the effects of weed have you noticed in yourself that your non schizophrenic peers don't seem to get?",Schizophrenia

I haven't really experienced any hallucinations, but I used to sometimes hear noises when I was around 11-12. Just strange noises that couldn't be explained or rationalized . Lately I've been having trouble comprehending sentences, and I've been having trouble forming sentences. Ive started stuttering a lot and I can't seem to get my words out anymore.

And when I notice them, they stop talking and disappear, it almost seems like Im not supposed to hear them, and I'm intruding on them. 

I used to also drink a lot at 14, and I dabbled in OxyContin at the same time. Ever since I haven't really had a lot of emotion, and nothing has really felt the same. But it's been getting worse lately and it's starting to worry me. I feel like I can't stay on one thing for more than 10 minutes at a time, either. Even typing this is taking a lot of effort. And has already taken hours. I always feel like I'm in some sort of autopilot or something.

I'm not trying to self diagnose or anything like that, I'm just wondering if this is something I should look out for?",Schizophrenia

"I'm used to having nightmares, I've been having them my whole adult life. Some nights are better than others but I always have them. Last night was a particularly unsettling one, and I woke up feeling horrible.

In my dream I was kidnapped and made to write code for a program I didn't understand. If I didn't, I wouldn't get my medication. The dream ended with me loosing touch with reality. I woke up terrified and panicked.

"The illness sounds scary to neurotypicals, it might be draining to handle someone who's symptomatic, there's stigma, people that don't know much about the illness thinks it makes us dangerous.

I don't want to go around telling people I just met I have schizophrenia because it'll give them weird ideas about me, it's also possible if I like someone for quite a while and open up about being schizophrenic it'll be a deal breaker.

I thought maybe psychology major students would be okay since they learn about mental illness but it's not guaranteed they'd be able to handle someone with something as tough as schizophrenia.

I keep killing bugs but after an hour more show up and its been happening non stop for a few weeks.

Its just me im just seeing all these goddamn bugs and im killing them when they apparently arent there. This is mostly a rant so dont take the questions too seriously but like what do i do to get rid of them. Im just constantly bothered by these bugs no matter what im doing. I wish i could get my cat or something to kill them but nothing would work for obvious reasons. Only peace I get is when i either have my eyes closed or when im outside where the bugs should be.

"I recently posted a few things here but I felt i should delete stuff. So I did. Maybe an introduction would be more appropriate to start with. I was a painfully shy child growing up. To remember my childhood is to remember the feelings of a nightmare. I couldn't speak correctly as a toddler and continued to take speech lessons until 2nd grade until I finally got my r's right. I've realized I do speak differently still because sometimes people will mock me when I talk and its always in a very similar way. It is very hard for me when I am misunderstood. Not for my speech now days but for who I am and where I am at and what challenges I am facing. It strikes down to the very root of me. I've had to learn that I do not need anyone to understand me for me to be ok. I had to learn how to let go of the hurt and that no one will ever truely reach me and even if I am obviously right or feel that I am right I do not need validation from anyone. I can let go and it is OK.

I'm not sure how my life could have been anything but a tragedy. It is quite obvious now that I never stood a chance. I needed attention from a family that goes donk on tv and for me to not be so easily amused became a very serious problem. I was told as a child that I was a very serious problem and that everything would be fine except for me because I had an actual condition that needed to be dealt with. My immediate family's reactions to me is exactly the same since then and it will never change as if I am still a kid and never grew up and just want to start arguments while they're trying to watch the television. They will always isolate me and to see that happen to other people was concerning but no matter how I tried to fix things I was only showing myself to be exactly what a bunch of unimaginable jerks have always had their mind made up on and agree about.

I had to move back to a house I'd rather never even visited again because of a bulkshit system that is literally snuffing people out by taking an individuals right to say what kind of drug their mind body and dare I say spirit is subjected to. I went through months of withdrawal and even when I printed up stuff to help people know what it is I'm going through they did not even care to ever educate themselves even a bit to ehat had been done to me and what I was trying to recover from. Invega sustenna is hell to all too many. I have never hallucinated or heard voices or anything so I can imagine if someone does that might help? Idk. People are not making it through such shit and surviving having survived is only the beginning. I should have known a family that never could put time into me or anyone else in such a neglectful household would be able to help but I really didn't have much if a choice the way things were unless I lied to someone I cared about that I might ever recover and be myswlf ever again. I did not know for nearly a year that the hell I was going through might actually let go. It finally has been. It's been a little over a year.

I am new here and I don't want to just assume I can feel at home and post a bunch of stuff like i did. Sorry.. I'm not sure where I belong but it would be nice to have a community to be part of. Ive been diagnosed schizophrenic for wuite some time now. Ive had a chronic detatchmmet from my surroundings and an overactive imagination that has and can run very far away with me to terrifying places that take a very long time to come out of. I have been treated very wrong with forced injections for stupid shit normal people would only get a ticket for if anything and I didn't even do anything but get beat up for being weird and disorderly in the upper of a duplex I was renting from someone that started having a serious problem with me. It was a very difficult and scary time and I understand and I shouldn't have called the cops for help but I feared for my life if I even tried to go back home there.

I believe that each and every human being that is and ever was and who will ever be is a very unique and special piece of us all. My hope is that people may realize that we are all actually pieces of eachother and important to one another and even though someone is very different doesnt mean that they arent the perfectly different piece to us that only that unique person is.

They debated on taking me to the hospital because they didn't know what was best for me at the moment. Now truthfully, I don't know what would be best for me either. I've had both the blessing and the curse of having only had major episodes by myself where no one is around to help me.

"I (20f) recently got diagnosed with schizoaffective, it's ran down 4 generations now so it's not shocking. My parents were very abusive and neglectful addicts and I moved out a year ago, I have 2 siblings but they were 4+ years my senior so I was alone a lot. I started seeing a psychiatrist in January and they told me what psychosis was, I realized after the appointment that I'd experienced it before and for a long time. I got diagnosed with SZA a month ago. It made me question my whole life. I can remember having visual and auditory hallucinations as young as 9 years old and it's not really ever stopped, though the hallucinations haven't terribly affected me as I thought it was normal. 

It depends on if you believe in these things but my family believes my childhood home was haunted. We moved in when I was 4 and I almost immediately started seeing things, people who came over heard things and had some creepy experiences but I was the only one that frequently saw things (ex: shadow people, little kids, animals, large almost warped characters, and scary men lingering in corners and closets which I still get all to this day just not as vivid almost), now I'm questioning if it was all a â€œhauntingâ€ or could I have been showing symptoms of schizophrenia since that early on in life?

They think they know exactly what I'm going though, my sister and my dad try to help, but they don't believe I'm mentally ill, when they talk to me all I can see is that they have no understanding of me and what I'm going through no matter how I explain it.

"I've had to make a grave choice between my mental health and my physical health. 

I have bipolar-type schizoaffective and have tried every single antipsychotic and mood stabilizer on the market, along with most antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds (I have severe anxiety as well). Every single one has gone wrong, most of them horribly wrong, and even the ones that are less likely to make people gain tons of weight, have done so to me. I have a lot of physical health issues, including dysautonomia and heart problems, and my body can't handle being even somewhat overweight. Despite exercising, following a healthy low-carb diet, etc., there is no way for me to avoid gaining weight on these drugs. Then my blood pressure shoots up, I end up in the ER and on the fast track to having a stroke even though I'm young, and I end up back on a slew of heart medications and having constant tests and heart monitors. I become more and more physically disabled and unhealthy over time.

Being off medication means I lose a lot of my functionality and stress tolerance, I have worsened symptoms, and my cognitive function steadily declines. I become more and more disabled mentally over time.

For me there is no good choice, there is no right answer. 

So I'm forced to pick the option that will kill me slower, even though it still severely messes up my life. That is the second option, being off medication.

"Hi all,
Not sure if I'm allowed to post this in here. 
My brother is 29 years old and he has been suffering with symptoms of schizophrenia since he was about 15.
He's never believed he had a problem, but his delusions and hallucinations were getting worse and worse, to the point that it was not safe for him to live at home with my parents anymore. (I live about 2 hours away, just for reference!)
My parents ended up having to call emergency services because he was in the middle of a delusional episode that was causing him to threaten my parents and accuse them of all sorts of things they had not done. 
They originally put him on a 72 hour hold, but it got extended into 2 weeks. The whole time he insisted he didn't know why he was there and that he was not sick. He refused to be tested for any mental health issues but two separate doctors told my mom they're fairly confident he has schizophrenia â€œoff the recordâ€.
But he agreed to take medication and follow the program they had him on. He was eating and showering and participating, which are not things my brother has ever shown interest in or done for himself. 
He was released today, and we did not know what he was going to do with himself since he's not allowed to go back to my parents house by order of the police. He also struggles with hardcore substance abuse so that was another concern for my family. 
But he just called me on Facebook video messenger and he looks so healthy and happy and this was the first clear, level headed conversation I've been able to have with him in literally 10 years. He said he's going to pick up his prescription and continue to take his meds, which was a HUGE thing for him to say in my opinion. I never thought I would see a point where he would willingly take medication. 
Anyway, I know he's pretty vulnerable right now and I just want to know the best way to support him, especially from so far away. 
I told him as long as I'm not working, he can call me any time and I'll pick up. But is there anything else I can do? 
He essentially called me â€œthe only sane person he trusts right nowâ€ and I don't want to lose that. I love my brother so much and I'd do anything to help him out right now. Thank you in advance for any advice!",Schizophrenia

"Hi everybody,

I'm happy to join the community.

My name is Witold Gawlik, I'm Polish. I became ill when I was 17teen (over half of my life already). My first diagnosis was ""acute psychotic disorder"" and as you may suppose it acutely turned my life upside down. Then I was twice more hospitalised, a year after the first post-psychotic depression, and some years later another psychotic kick at the beginning of 2014, fuelled by marihuana. 

My final diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder. I had 2 severe psychosis that I managed to heal without going to a psychiatric hospital. Also, 3 more recent ""home"" psychosis dominated by negative symptoms. All of them were preceded by giving up or reducing medication. 

In 2016 I decided to ""come out"" and recorded a video on YouTube. I expected to be hated. I was ready for it but the outcome was the opposite. There was negligible hate and a huge amount of appreciation and support. I opened myself to sharing what before was covered by the vain of my shame.  And that was the beginning of the [Psychiczne Pojednanie (Mental Reconciliation) vlog](https://www.youtube.com/@WitoldGawlik) and also a [written blog](https://blog.psypo.pl/). Through it, I try to fight the stigma surrounding mental issues, clarify myths, and oppose the anti-psychiatry movement. Also, I share what I've been through and find a spiritual aspect of all that experience. Almost all of that is in Polish... but I consider recording in English too. I know English pretty well since I studied international MSc program. 

I decided to explore more on the disease I have and here I am on the Reddit schizophrenia group. I want to learn more and maybe support English speakers that go through a similar experience.

I find this group already helpful, I was just reading about not clear evidence of brain damage caused by psychosis. All modern science is basically in English so it's a good thing to be here. 

Don't hesitate to ask if you would like to know something about Polish ""mental health reality"". 

Cheers! :-)",Schizophrenia

I think I might try the patches and nicotine gum together to quit smoking. I've tried the patches on their own before but I wasn't able to quit. The reason behind this is because I haven't been feeling healthy and the smoking makes me feel worse. I have avolition so I haven't been able to go walking and I quit my side job. I think if I continue to keep smoking and feeling unhealthy I won't live very long. I'm on latuda. At first I had more energy to do things but after a while the avolition started to kick in. I've been smoking so much that I started getting nicotine sick and now my throat hurts. So that's why I'm going to give it a shot at the patches and nicotine gum. Hope this all works out. I hope I find a med where I'll feel more healthy and actually loose weight and workout more and eat more healthier.,Schizophrenia

"The answer: the poor narrowed one. My belief is that, if the world were truly enlightened, great wisdom could be found by carefully studying voices. I mean, look, this is life! We are here, on this planet, and we do not know exactly why. How mind-blowing isn't that? However, my belief is that everything IS for a reason, which means that voices are here for a reason! 

I'm schizophrenic and I actually never had voices in my head. I had visual hallucinations. What I want to say to you who are dealing with voices is this: perhaps you are put on a tough test. I know you do suffer! But there is always an upside too, there must be. What if you could earn great wisdom about existence through the voices? What if you could learn to understand the voices better than the voices can understand you? What if God tests his strongest soldiers hardest, and that this soldier is actually you? Who can claim that you are â€crazyâ€ (seriously, what does â€crazyâ€ even mean?) just because you're hearing voices? My answer: no one! Because no one knows by this date. And that's part of this whole mystery..

My point is not to neglect that schizophrenia is real with its horrible effects on the individual and their families. My point is that society, sadly, is so sure of its own superiority over the schizophrenic, when society in fact is always moving in multiple directions. We have proven to be wrong sometimes, and right other times. Now, in 2022, we are just in a wind gust of history and God knows what will be said about voices in the future? Perhaps there is a life after this where it Will become clear that the voices were all true, as true as the sun rises in the morning. Maybe, maybe, the voices are inartificial, true, real. And by â€realâ€ I mean like real real! 

Just thoughts..

"My fiancÃ© is on the max dose of invega and is experiencing many negative effects similar to that of a lobotomy. He can't feel much emotion and is often very quiet. He does not think about consequences or feel any concern for that matter. He sometimes comes across as child-like and appears to be cognitively delayed. 

Off medication he is a very different person. He is highly intelligent and care very much for the people in his life. The downside is that he has very scary delusions, violent behaviour if made upset and can't sleep. 

On his medication, he does very idiotic things that damage the relationship with no emotion about it or concern. He will justify a wrong action by saying he was bored and will have zero empathy. 

I'm at my breaking point but don't want to give up on him because of the medications effects. He has lost everyone in his life and only has me.

"Hello everybody. I will make this quick. Some context is that as a child I could not talk which led to an autism diagnosis. Started school late and I've been in speech therapy up until middle school. 

I've always sounded â€œweirdâ€ but I'm not unintelligible. I got a school-required psych eval done and it was written I had a prominent flat effect. 

Third psych eval I was in the mental hospital and they suspected I had early-onset schizophrenia and not STPD, so I was re-examined and they had told me I had a speaking disorder (they did tell me which one and I do not remember it) I didn't understand and they told me that I had repetitive phonic whatever, weird pronunciation but mainly that I would instead words and phrases that were not appropriate in the sentence over and over. 

Yet another time I'm ordered a psych eval because now they think I have a â€œdisabilityâ€ that they didn't specify and my foster mother kept from me. I ended up just not doing the psych eval because I was moving out that same weekend. 

The inappropriate phrase thing was not something that happened as a result of the mental hospital visit as I had to also work on that in speech therapy and it's commented a lot by peers but I never took it seriously because they weren't professionals and I'm very picky about people assuming things about my mental problems or health. 

I thought at first this is schizophasia, but my problems aren't that noticeable or extreme. Is schizophasia on a spectrum? Could it be I had it at a young age and slowly got better?

"Hi! I'm trying to get some feedback or help regarding my wife's mental illness.

She was around a lot of physical abuse of her mother as a child. She's had erotomania and ADD since a teenager. I always suspected erotomania, and there were a several clear, but minor episodes, but last year she really came unglued and had a psychotic break that seemed to last somewhere between 4 weeks and 10 weeks. She seemed mostly her normal self around me, but definitely not at work. It led to a really bad outcome for our marriage (see my post history if interested).

She thought the radio was communicating with her and that God had chosen her for something special and she was to have a coworker as a soulmate in the afterlife. She imagined entire conversations with coworkers that did not a actually happen. Delusions (referential, erotomanic, religious, grandiose), disorganized thinking, and unclear, but possibly hallucinations (no motor or movement issues).

I've known her for 19 years, and have detailed info on what life was like for her before that. She has been unable to maintain any friendships ever. She could not even bring herself to talk to people when we met, not even over the phone. Since then, she has seen psychologists who had preliminary speculation that it was a drug induced psychosis (marijuana and too much ritalin), but probably with underlying issues. They speculated schizophrenia, schizoaffectivve, or bipolar. While honing in on the latter two, she was sent to a neuro-specialist who did all kinds of very extensive cognitive testing for two days. His assessment was that he could only \*currently\* detect ADD, PTSD, and anxiety. At this point she was dropped by her psychologist when she admitted that she had again smoked marijuana after being told not to (she has quit since).

On my own research, I've found that she seems to fit the negative symptoms for schizophrenia pretty well, but I guess I'm just an armchair psychiatrist while waiting for her new psych first time appointment, which is a couple of months out and the main reason I'm reaching out to reddit. 

Symptoms include:  


1. Withdrawal / Asociality : Extreme social withdrawal and anxiety
2. Flattening / Anhedonia / Blunted affect: she is often anhedonic, especially later into the evening. She often seems to not be able to show body language and spoke emotion for what she is feeling/thinking. When her mother died from cancer, she had no visual response. She didn't seem to care much).
3. Trouble with speech / Alogia: she can never seem to find words to express emotions or what she's thinking very well. She often has to resort to written text to communicate feelings to me when we have a conflict.
4. No follow-through / Avolition: she has a lot of ADD symptoms, and maybe that's all they are.
5. Cognitivve / thinking issues: Something is really not right with her executive decision making. She has working memory issues, confabulation issues, paying attention, impulse, etc.

"Back 7 years ago when I first went into a drug induced psychosis I'll stay up day and night looking for a solution for my paranoid/Schiz. The feeling of being watched constantly, everyone knowing everything about you, everything you do. I couldn't scroll through my phone or watch TV or be honest with myself because the voices will call out everything I was thinking, doing, it was like the voices had the power to foresee my future, I couldn't even breath, I was literally holding my breath. Risperdal and Zyprexa wasn't helping at all, The net said that Schizophrenia was Permanente..There was no cure for this illness, at that moment during my youth when I'm suppose to be happy; I was doomed for life. Stuck in a mental prison. I can never be normal again, all I knew is that the world was wicked and I am to weak to live in it...But I had no choice but to keep living as my lesser self, I was obviously to weak to take my own life, and there was no convincing every human being about the world I lived in. I was to ignorant and naive to believe that every single person care about my personal problems. This illness was my biggest and only excuse not to live normally. But as time went on I grew tolarlate of the voices, numb to the problems around me; I didn't care about any opion or prospective but my own, this became my downfall eventually. I learned my lesson. The time from when I started hearing voices till now, the voices started to fade. I just wondered If I stay healthy, keep myself sharp, continue push toward my goals, change my environment constantly, and express myself to trusted individuals. Will these Voices eventually go away? 
It Took 3 years for the volume of the voices to dem slightly. But I think they still linger because I continue to indulge in my old habits, entertain negative/delusional thoughts.

I'm not sure if I am developing some type of psychotic depression or what but I am feeling really scared. Everyday I get scared that I will have a panic attack again and start hallucinating. I feel like my whole life has been changed by these moments. 

When the hallucinations start, I see a demon. It is a white face with a big smile and either white or black eyes and it makes me look into its eyes. It wants to possess me I think. When this has happened I was so freaked out that my body went into complete shock and I literally couldn't move and was trembling with fear. I do not touch weed or alcohol anymore or any drugs. I am scared though. If I think about the face I get scared and sometimes it can trigger a panic attack and the hallucinations start. 

I have always felt like a spiritual person and have been able to sense things others couldn't. However now I feel like maybe that was all in my head. I don't know. I feel like my whole life is a lie and I am scared. Anyone else relate ?

"What do you do for someone who is your brother who is going through delusional breaks, and has been now for a while and is very resistant to medical help when its not life or death? How do you tell them that they have to get the help in order to not suffer? Does family intervention work? What if they are in the middle of the delusions? Is that the wrong time to try and talk to them? What do you say to make them realize that its not reality? Or even move forward?",Schizophrenia
"Hey, I have paranoid schizophrenia. I am pretty high functioning. I train weights 2-4 hours a day (I can actually squat 200kg and my body weight is about 80kg) stupid flex but I'm proud of it, and I go to school, I'm actually the one with highest grades in my class. When I first got the diagnosis, I refused to take the medication they offered me (abilify) because the side effects on physical health were horrendous. After a few months I started to worry that some of the Psychiatrists had bad intentions towards schizophrenics, because I heard about how other schizophrenics were treated, like they were forced to take injections and being abused physically and psychologically by authorities, I also think that maybe the government in my country has something against schizophrenics, I knew another schizophrenic that went to a psych ward with decent cognitive abilities, but when he returned after a few months, it was like talking to a brick wall, and after this I got so scared that I purposely made the Psychiatrists believe they had misdiagnosed me, I started to act like I had adhd which resembles schizophrenia a bit, I researched adhd alot so I played it perfectly. And it worked, the Psychiatrists don't think I'm schizophrenic anymore, and they are probably going to give me adderall.",Schizophrenia

"my paranoia takes many forms, sometimes it is severe and sometimes mild. my worse paranoid fears come and go, but most of them linger in the back of my mind. there are several that i'm unable to shake and that influence my reality. the most common and painful one is that i'm somehow faking my illness and that my doctors know, it seems that they give me sugar pills and mock me behind my back. it makes therapy damn near impossible and conversations with the psychiatrist is like interrogation.",Schizophrenia
"My Brother (30 M) was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2015, ever since then he quit his job and is living with me and my family. Everything has been under control as he helps around the house and goes out once or twice a day, however, he refuses to go to talk to anyone professional. Recently he has been contacting my mother's family and sending threats to these people through Facebook. My mother has contacted these people and everyone was accepting and blocked him or ignored him. However, he refuses to stop even though my mom sat down with him and told him that its worries people around him such as our sick grandma who always calls him every day. He has never had a history of violence so we are sure he would never harm anyone. He has contacted his old friends who live near our home and is sending them threats too, these friends are affiliated with drug users and people in our street who have a bad reputation. Most of his old friends understand his condition however 1 or 2 people he sent threats to have responded with threats in audio form.  Is there any suggestions we can do.

TLDR: Brother (30 M) sending threats to family mutuals. Refuses to stop and sent threats to people near our home with a bad reputation. What can we do?",Schizophrenia
"The last couple of weeks I have been pretty depressed. The antidepressants doesn't seem to work anymore, been laying in bed a lot. I am too much of a coward to kill myself. But I have been feeling some relief with the thought that I am going to die and I 100 % can't escape it. I just don't know if I want to wait until I die from natural causes. Wish I could just have energy and the ability to enjoy life. Sick of laying in bed.",Schizophrenia
"I have this paranoid fear that I have somehow faked my condition and that the doctors are feeding me sugar pills and mocking me behind my back. It's on par with the other delusions like Neo-Nazi sleeper agents with sunglasses and hand signals, and my fear that I'm being sent messages through the radio, television, and every other device. I hate to admit it, and it took me years to talk about the voices and delusions, but I'm sick with this psychosis, and it will never end. I have talked to my therapist about this, she reassured me, but I still believe it. I am in hell and nobody really cares.",Schizophrenia
"Over the past few months I've been having delusions related to me being a time traveler. It's really hard for me to fully explain but I feel as though I have the ability to skip through time.

An example would be that I was at work yesterday and my brain kinda paused and went on auto pilot? I told myself that I would be home in just a few hours and then boom, I was home in what felt like 5 minutes.

Auto pilot is a common thing for me to experience and it feels as though for me time is different. Some of my friends would ask why the day was going by so slow; but I would personally feel as though each day goes by twice as fast as they used to. It's really hard to explain and I'm trying to figure out what is going on in my brain to cause this.

Does anyone else experience auto pilot/time travel-like delusions? If you have any questions I am open to answering as well :)",Schizophrenia
"This is going to be more of a vent post, I just feel so fucking alone and misunderstood in a way I never have been before.

I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective almost 2 months ago now and its changed everything. I had bipolar but when I had my first psychotic event, I began having hallucinations all day every day to varying degrees since, so the diagnosis shifted to Schizoaffective. I worked in a medical field and had to quit because I can't help people when I am unsure of reality and can't remember much, I wouldn't want to mishandle medication or act inappropriately which I felt could easily happen.

My issues before were relatable to just about everyone or on the playing field of normal enough to be accepted. Now its like everyone is treating me like an entirely different person and severely misunderstanding me no matter what I do.

My roommate and best friend has become cruel. She says she is making jokes to help it feel less scary, we have always used a lot of humor over our shared mental illness struggles but its not clicking for her how fucked up her 'jokes' are. What I need is genuine fucking compassion. Whenever I mention that its upsetting she acts annoyed that ""Oh you can joke about my mental illness but god forbid its yours"". Yeah when we are both talking about being depressed because we both experienced it, it makes sense. Both parties are laughing. She acts like I was picking on her. But I certainly wasn't. And she definitely is now.

If I mention a noise she pretends its not real before laughing and saying she is kidding. She will knock on my door and I will say ""Yes?"" and she wont open it. She has done this multiple times in a row then opened the door laughing saying she was just messing with me, haha. She will ask ""how my friends are doing"" , ""the ones in your head"". Admittedly this did give me a bit of a chuckle internally but still. She will make me think I am hallucinating when I am not and when I try and be honest with her about how scary my life has gotten since I started experiencing hallucinations she just stares at me and doesn't....get it. Mood disorders are real struggles of course but psychotic disorders alter reality in a way that cant be explained to others who aren't bothering to try and understand. 

I experience so many symptoms and she gets upset over them rather than understanding. Either she is mad or she is laughing at me. I however have comforted her through countless crisis events with nothing but love and empathy. 

I have other friends that are enormously kind but I don't live with them and my biggest symptom beyond hallucinations is isolating so if you're not in my apartment I am likely not interacting with you. So I still feel alone.",Schizophrenia
"I honestly need a break for a while. I feel like all I have been doing is work non-stop without any breaks, except for weekends but even then I can't rest cause I need to buy groceries (I don't have a car), cook and study. I simply feel like all I'm doing is work in some way and I'm so exhausted.  I haven't been sick for 1 hour or a day till now. Do you think it's okay to take a day or 2 off from work? Or do you think you always have to be sick to take a break?

Last year never taking a break resultet in a relapse for me. I didn't need to be hosplitalized, but I had to take a higher dose of antipsychotics and suffered several acute symptoms. It was no fun. I really want to avoid it this time..",Schizophrenia
"I think I have it from clopixol but I switched to abilify and its still kinda there. Its very mild and is only ocasionally licking lips every few days so Im lucky.

"Hello everyone,  
I am 22yr old from india,   
I had my first psychosis episode when i was 17yr old and the 2nd episode happened after 4years on april 2022. my psychiatrist diagnosed my symptoms as PSYCHOSIS NOS and when i asked him if there is possibility of me developing schizophrenia he just told me to not think about this and all and just continue with normal life. but i do know if i get more stress or sleeplessness i get into an psychotic episode. is there possibility of people with psychosis developing schizophrenia in future? i do know psychosis is the symptoms of schizophrenia and i feel after every episode my cognitive function were getting impaired and i am not able to do things which i did before.",Schizophrenia
"Through out my life, I occasionally heard some voice talking to me. It didn't happen often, but it really irritated me. The last time that happened, and the only time I remember what happened, was like a year ago or so. I was playing video games with a friend and he wasn't talking. So I asked â€žwhy so quiet?â€œ and i heard a voice fairly similar to his shouting â€žI'm. Not. QUIETâ€œ. I was confused, and asked him about why hes so aggressive. He didn't know what I was talking about. Only then i realized that the voices don't actually match, but are only similar. I was very confused and just said â€žnevermind.â€œ Does this mean anything? Is this normal? Is this how schizophrenia starts? Please say this is normal",Schizophrenia

Just got home from inpatient my diagnosis changed from schitzoaffective to schizophrenia. My medication also changed from invega to perphenazine. Anyone have any luck with this medication they told me I'm less likely to experience weight gain on this med I've already accumulated 40+ pounds from antipsychotics. I had a relatively good experience in the hospital I went to better than the previous inpatient stents.,Schizophrenia

"Since April I am trying to lower olanzapine, but it's really difficult, because I have some awful days with symptoms and I am not able to dose 100% right. I have tabs of 2,5mg and I cut them in half and quarter take ~ 75% of the hole. Some days I have a little to less and than my brain is not working right. It really destroys performance on these days and I also sleep badly. Is there a better way to dose right ?",Schizophrenia
"Like whats the point of me living. I already know that past friends dont wanna associate with me because of my illness. There's also this girl that i met in highschool who dont wanna associate with me either. Im pretty sure i fell in love with her. Feelings still remain for her but im not sure if its love (if that makes sense). I just wish they knew how sane i am.... If you here that someone is schizophrenic, most people's first instinct would be to avoid that person. Which I understand. I need things to change. Right now. I hope God helps me out hopefully now. But i doubt it.",Schizophrenia
