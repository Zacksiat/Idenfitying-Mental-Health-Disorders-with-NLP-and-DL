"Does anyone else think the most important part of life is being in a relationship? like the absolute most important. I don‚Äôt really care for any other goals in my life lol as long as I end up in a relationship. that‚Äôs like my ultimate life goal. I wish I wasn‚Äôt like this tho.

my therapist will ask me ab life goals and I just can‚Äôt imagine doing anything without someone by my side.",Bpd
"Hello fellow friends üòÑ

I'm on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.

There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?

For me I will first become silent and blame myself, ""maybe if I"" or ""If I only"", ""maybe he's just not having it today"", ""maybe I simply don't get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding"". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don't know whether you guys get to experience this as well? 

I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:

""The maximum amount of rage. it's like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It's the point people don't recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It's disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn't even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she's completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I'm shaking as I'm writing this because I know it's still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone's life. I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I didn't, but I know I shouldn't see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he's using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn't get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don't work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.""

To put things in perspective: Normally I'm a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should ""stand up for myself more.""

So yeah, to end this long rant with the clear questions I started it with: ""There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?""",Bpd
"My [F20] bf [M20] told me today (after I said ‚ÄúI just wish I could be better for you‚Äù) that he likes me for who I am, and that I don‚Äôt need to be better for him. And after crying about how I don‚Äôt think anyone has ever said that to me before, I realized that I don‚Äôt know who I am. I know my name, I know my age, I know my school and my hair colour and my weight and my shoe size, but I don‚Äôt know any qualitative. I don‚Äôt have a favourite meal, or a favourite movie, I don‚Äôt know what hobbies I have anymore, or what I‚Äôd like in a partner, or my favourite restaurant. I don‚Äôt know when I lost myself, or if this is even related to my bpd, but has anyone else experienced this? Am I alone?",Bpd
"Okay, I‚Äôm about to open up about many things I‚Äôve done in my past that I‚Äôm not proud of. I‚Äôm not that person anymore. In these stories I was 17 and immature as fuck. I‚Äôm now 22 with a total different take on life.

I became best friends with this girl in 2017. We were both 17 at the time. We did everything together. We smoked weed daily. Sleepovers. Longboard together. Did acid together. We did everything together. We would die for each other.

Once we robbed our mutual friends house. We stole $200 from the girls dad. I ended up telling the girl and paid her back Bc I felt bad. 

Once we robbed a building and made out with $1,500 and never got caught.

Once we robbed a house we thought was someone we knew who just robbed us. Turned out it was a fake address he gave us and we robbed a random house. We never got caught.

Once we got arrested for robbing cars off acid while drunk. We caught some fines for that. 

We did a lot of sneaky bad shit together. After the last time we got caught, we stopped doing all that shit. We were doing really well. 

Long story short this is how our friendship ended.‚¨áÔ∏è

I was dating a super toxic dude and she‚Äôd tell me to leave him all the time. Finally I left him. We went to a party and had a fucking blast. The next day I went home and sent her this whole long text about how her and her bf were toxic and that they should break up. 

She didn‚Äôt take that lightly. I don‚Äôt blame her I wasn‚Äôt nice about it and it came out of no where. We were literally fine the day before.

I ended up switching schools and she started rumors that I wanted to break them up because I wanted her boyfriend and he told everyone I tried to kiss him. Not true. He didn‚Äôt like me because she spent more time with me than him and he voiced that all the time.

Then I got with my current boyfriend HERE IT IS... I got my boyfriend to rob her house. I specifically said he could only take weed related things. No money and can‚Äôt steal from her mom. So he took two bongs and 8gs of weed. She assumed it was me right away Bc who else knew her window didn‚Äôt shut. I finally admitted to her like 5/6 months later during our graduation. When I told her, it looked like she wanted to kill me but she kept her cool on the outside.

Let‚Äôs call my best friend that I had my bf rob - Katrina
Let‚Äôs call the girl Katrina and I robbed $200 from her parents - Yazra

Yazra wasn‚Äôt mad at Katrina or Me for robbing her parents. She accepted out apology. Yazra invited me and Katrina to her graduation party. We both show up and there I gave Katrina $300 to make up for what I had robbed. She didn‚Äôt seem happy. I don‚Äôt blame her. 

It‚Äôs been 5ish years since 2017 when we were best friends. We are friends on Facebook but we don‚Äôt talk. 

Last week I shared a post that says ‚Äúif you were ever my closet friend at one point just know I think about you from time to time and hope you‚Äôre doing great things in life‚Äù and she heart reacted my post

4 days ago I saw her at the liquor store. She was right behind me in line. I was consumed in anxiety and couldn‚Äôt even bring myself to say hi or even look at her. When we first saw each other we both looked shook and then quickly looked/walked away. She also said nothing. 

I really really want to be her friend again. I cry over her all the time. I vent about her in my journals. I write letters that I think I would one day send to her but never do. 

Do you think she forgave me?

Do you think she misses me?

Do you think she could give me a chance again?

Do you think she‚Äôs even capable of trusting me again?

Don‚Äôt you think she could forgive me after everything we did to other people?

Do you think I should try to message her?

I apologized 100 times back in 2018 during graduation and at the graduation party and repaid her.

What should I say if I do message her?

I really don‚Äôt want to never message her and move on from her. She‚Äôs really special to me. I love her a lot. She was the best friend I ever had besides all the bad stuff we did. I know we are both grown up now and we wouldn‚Äôt do any more stupid reckless shit if we were friends again. 

Help. I‚Äôm a wreck.",Bpd
"Without going into detail, this diagnosis explains so much. The sudden break ups, severe mood swings, destructive and controlling behaviour - all makes a lot more sense now.

We have been on and off for the past 7 months since we broke up, but recently we‚Äôve been on and it‚Äôs genuinely felt like we‚Äôre rebuilding a meaningful connection again.

She came to me straight away after her psychology appointment to talk to me about it, and what it could mean for us in the future. She shared her insecurities and concerns about it, but also what she knows she can build on within her self moving forward. She told me with confidence that she is willing to give our relationship a good shot again, and I am too.

Being aware of her diagnosis, we can work together and with help of her psychologist it looks like she‚Äôs getting back on track again - and I‚Äôm willing to support her through all of this.

She‚Äôs asked me not to tell anyone about this at least until she‚Äôs ready, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve come here to update this subreddit.

Anyone willing to share any experiences or give any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",Bpd
"(Reposting here on the larger sub on recommendation of people from the smaller sub)

I am not sure how common my story is, but I think it's more common than I would think.

I was a problem child for a lot of my childhood in school, but began to improve in middle school. I was very bad with people all my life and everyone who meets me ends up disliking me (this is not an exaggeration, this is unfortunately quite literally the case). This caused me to be a very homebound child and I grew very, very attached to my family. I was academically rather successful in HS, but socially the same. College was an unmitigated disaster for me and at the urging of someone I ""saw someone"". The last time I was evaluated was for autism and ADHD in elementary school and was given a clean bill of health, so to speak.

After two days of talking to someone, the psychiatrist said she believed I had BPD. I heard of the condition before, but I was taken aback and after several sessions asked if she stood by her assessment and she said yes (she claimed to have a bit of experience working with people with personality disorders). After our sessions ended (I saw her in secret), that was kind of it.

I began reading about BPD more and more and the more I read, the less I saw myself in the condition. Yes, I have huge issues with impulse control and have pretty dire self inflicted issues with my health. I am very clingy to people because of the fact everyone I have ever known has run away from me. I have a limited sense of self, to a certain extent, and have huge problems being alone without anyone with me. 

But otherwise, it just doesnt click all that much. I am not suicidal, I am not driven to make rash sudden decisions that screw up my life, I am not the kind of person who would quit a job just because I want to curse out my boss (I am pretty good at holding my tongue when there is something in it for me). I wouldn't say I have emotional dysregulation. I know mood swings are the calling card of the condition, and I cant say I have mood swings. 

I know you have to meet 5 of 9 criteria. I would say I meet 3 of them like a glove, 4 if we are being generous, and 5 if we are playing fast and loose. And that is just to meet the lowest threshold of the condition. 

This happened a few years ago, and I havent followed up on it, but the problems in my life havent gone away. 

I figure that I have to wrestle with whether or not I was misdiagnosed to make progress on that front. Is it a thing to be misdiagnosed? Is this a condition like ADHD, where it's over applied? I am a guy, if it makes any difference.

Thanks a lot, everyone",Bpd
"I grew up mostly dating men but realized when I was a teenager that I also like women. I know for sure that I am attracted to women, but I go off and on with feeling or knowing if I like men. Do I dislike my male ex‚Äôs because they did me wrong or because I forced myself to date men through compulsory heterosexuality?


A few years ago I did believe that I was a lesbian, then went back to bisexual a year later. Now I feel like I am a lesbian again but honestly I really am not sure.


I label myself as queer now because I don‚Äôt know if I truly fit into the bisexual category or lesbian category. I wish I didn‚Äôt have so many identity issues so that I wasn‚Äôt so worried about this/may be able to understand myself easier and not struggle so much with my identity.",Bpd
"I posted on this sub earlier today about having trouble believing my boyfriend even loves me. We are literally moving into a house together and he always reassures me so I know he does‚Ä¶you can look at my post history to see it. 

Anyway, I spiraled and got drunk out of anxiety. I went into his facebook page and went YEARS deep and found pics and posts and comments with an ex from literally so long ago. We are both 22, and he was like 16 in these posts. But I saw his family interacting with her and saying how much they love her like they do to me now, and I have broken down. I am sobbing and hysterical and so upset. I know it‚Äôs irrational but I am a mess right now. 

I feel like I have been flying off the BPD handle lately. I am never NOT freaking out about something. I guess my question is, should I mention this? I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs my issue, and not his. He also didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, this is from YEARS ago. I just now can‚Äôt get it out of my head that his whole family is just tolerating me at best, and I am just meaningless. I hate that he has had exes because ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know why. I do, too.

"If they were to tell you that you were being overdramatic, how would you react or feel? I had the last straw and decided to not talk to my boyfriend.

It was my mom's birthday and he didn't even say happy birthday to her.

"My appointment with my therapist last week ended up getting cancelled. I have not been handling the last three weeks very well and it‚Äôs bascially been non-stop meltdowns. So needless to say I have not been using my DBT skills when I should have been. 

Decided over the weekend I should make some DBT flash cards sets so I can keep myself distracted. One to keep at home and the other to keep at work. 

I spent last night doing up emotion regulation skills and distress tolerance skills. Tonight was spent making another copy of those two. Tomorrow night will be spent making interpersonal effectiveness skills and mindfulness skills cards.

"Hi guys whenever I get overwhelmed and find myself having what I think is an episode, I end up screaming, crying, and hitting myself by punching my thighs and my head.

I just want to see if episodes like this are common with others. What I mean by screaming is that I'll be sobbing so hard that I just end up screaming out of sorrow.

"So within the past couple months ive came to the realization that I have to deal with my borderline and bipolar. 

Been out of the dating scene for two years after a string of awful relationships. Me and this girl have talked as friends everyday for 6 months  been dating for 3, and it‚Äôs great overall I love her very much. 

With the new relationship ive found myself creeping into old thought patterns and codependency. I‚Äôve never been to a psychiatrist or anything, just been obsessed with personal development since I was 14. It‚Äôs hard to deal with because logically she has done nothing to trigger these emotions.

I thought I had these aspects of myself dealt with and released but there‚Äôs still more. I find myself worrying about every little change in energy or if she will just get bored and leave me. I feel as if I never do enough when I give my absolute all. It‚Äôs very confusing and I struggle on my end to not resent myself.

I can‚Äôt afford going to therapy or anything but, I‚Äôm just wondering if anybody feels the same or has any advice. I really do love this woman and refuse to let bpd run me, it‚Äôs just so hard having the ‚Äúflip‚Äù and spinning thoughts over nothing about someone you know cares about you.",Bpd
"Two days ago I posted something so cute about hitting 76 days clean and now I‚Äôm all fucked up. Idk what happened but my bf (LDR) said that he wanted to shorten my trip length from a week to just a weekend. This changed comes after about a week of him acting really weird, he says he‚Äôs got a concussion but he worked and drank too much making it worse. I was ok with that but I wish he told me before when he was acting weird so I knew. 

He wasn‚Äôt talking to me or texting me as much as he used to saying he needs to minimize phone time or he just doesn‚Äôt use his phone when he‚Äôs out or with fam or friends but he‚Äôs with them 24/7!! The phone is literally how we communicate and how this relationship works!! I felt abandoned like he just didn‚Äôt care bc he refused to compromise, we went from talking ~1-2 hr on the phone each day and like 500???? texts to like ~30 min on the phone and 100 texts a day. 

I really hurt. I felt alone. He has so much time with his friends and family in person and I don‚Äôt ever get to see him, and he still wants to shorten our trip that is literally still a week and a half away bc of his concussion when he literally does the same stuff we‚Äôd be doing maybe even more when I came up. He says he needs to feel independent but I‚Äôm literally 1000 miles away and am just ducking asking for 8% of ur time every day. 

He knew I had BPD from the start but I have genuinely been able to control it better than ever before until tonight. I just feel like he‚Äôs making excuses to not talk to me and not let me come up anymore, but why? You know what my mind jumps to‚Ä¶ I believe him when he says he had a concussion but I really just feel like he changed into a different person. He went from being the perfect person everyone loved him promising me everything caring and understanding and now he acts like I‚Äôm fucking disgusting and he hates me. 

Tonight he promised me that I would have a chance to call and talk to him for a while, but then he called late and said he was tired and needed to go to sleep to rest up instead but then I texted him a little later and he texted back and he had just been chilling with his brother who he sees CONSTANTLY. And then called his friend instead of talking to me after promising me!! He always sees and talks to these people he lives so close to them! He literally just acts like he fucking hates me and I‚Äôve kept it together for a fucking week and a half and I really just wanted to fuckinf see him for enough time.

"Is it overcompensating because you feel unworthy, so you need to give others an added value, because you aren't one ?
Is it you picking narcissistic people so that they feed of you, since it's familiar?
Is it out of kindness and empathy?
Is it out of guilt?
Were you trying to save yourself through them?
Why the self sacrifice?
Why doing so and not being at all happy about it, even angry at yourself?
Why those people disappear once you stuck on their side when they were in distress? Or was it you pushing them away, because you feel that now that you aren't needed you will be discarded? Or them changing their attitude? Are you the jerk at the end ? Or is it them ?
And why does it feel good, so good when you weren't the one that messed it up, after asking most of the people you know, if you did? And why can't you get over it, ever,  when you did?

I've never had a ""sure"" answer for those questions, I don't trust my judgement, and maybe I'm just victimising myself, or maybe I'm not.

"A couple of years ago, prior to being diagnosed-- I impulsively cheated on my husband.

I work now, have created a life and goals for myself, and pay for therapy sessions out of pocket (bc my insurance doesn't work with this therapist and she's been integral in my recovery) and really DO the work daily to not let borderline rule me or my impulses anymore. I still feel them-- especially as I was taught from early ages to equate self worth with sexuality etc, but I work hard daily to be better. 

I confessed everything to my husband a year and a half ago, and my marriage has really changed for the better. Before where we had no connection, we have finally been best friends now the last while.

BUT... now one thing i‚Äôve realized about myself is that i‚Äôm starting to pick up this behavior where i am getting into relationships &amp; whenever someone cheats on me or hurts me, i play victim whole time i cheated first or and cheating just like them except i play the victim and act like as if i‚Äôm not doing anything wrong. when the person ends up leaving and coming back to apologize, i hold the grudge over their head hoping it‚Äôll hurt them into thinking their karma is coming for them for how they treated me. when whole time i‚Äôm mirroring what they are doing to me without them knowing. 

i stay in this victim mentality and don‚Äôt break out of character. i‚Äôll cry and cry and cry, but deep down i know im not the victim but they‚Äôll never know that. you know, a lot of people have thought their karma was because of me. maybe it was, or maybe it wasn‚Äôt. is it so wrong to play victim though? i need answers.",Bpd
"Hi all. I‚Äôm a 24 F with diagnosed BPD. Right now I‚Äôm on Zoloft and going through DBT. Anyway, I talk to my therapist about this and she doesn‚Äôt understand what I mean or why I am like this way. One day I truly feel so in love with someone I want to do everything for them. The next day WITHOUT ANY TRIGGERS I hate them, don‚Äôt want them to be happy etc. I‚Äôm aware that I split when I‚Äôm triggered but this is different than splitting. Same goes with everything else in my life. Standards, morals, etc. It‚Äôs just like some hours of the day I have these overwhelming lovey dovey euphoric feelings and then a minute later I‚Äôm in agonizing pain, for no reason at all. What does this mean? I feel like I can do all the DBT in the world but it would never fix this part of me.

I‚Äôve apologized every single time I‚Äôve been rude or mean to him , yet he never apologizes and blames it all on me .

"Hi there, I would very much like to talk to anyone who has done or is doing Transference focused practice for BPD or other issues. I have tried it but haven't found a therapist who is a good fit yet and would also very much appreciate any names of therapists (any area) since it's so difficult to find TFP specialists.

I know TFP is supposed to be a challenging and non-supportive therapy, but so far I've found it very difficult, at times I honestly have felt like I'm going crazy (perhaps from the inherent message you get that you don't know reality as well as the therapist) but I really don't want to self-sabotage and quit.

In case it's interesting to hear my experience, I've briefly seen a female therapist in Mexico who disappeared when she didn't have availability and a man currently in the U.S. who has made me uncomfortable by repeatedly asking me about my sex life (mostly at the beginning but it's hard now because I don't feel I can discuss similar topics since I've been pressured) and who at times comes off as sarcastic, he has no Google reviews but was the only person I could find and is in my neighborhood but all my TFP sessions have been online so I'm happy to talk to anyone in the world.

I'd also love to have an actual phone (or at least text) conversation with someone doing TFP so we could support each other going through it.",Bpd
"ive had pretty much unlimited access to my fp the past few days, spent all day friday together, watched shit together this weekend, but now that they need to work and are planning on being distant the next two weeks for school, i cannot function. this feels so embarrassing to admit but ive literally had no motivation to do anything today. i just constantly wait around for them, i dont feel like im living my own life right now and its so overwhelming. i was getting better (independent) so quickly and they were really proud of me and this feels like a pretty big step backwards :(

"I didn‚Äôt have a breakup, but I had an ending of a situationship which honestly wasn‚Äôt that serious but really took an emotion toll on me. I‚Äôm completely over the person, but I tend to still trigger myself over how the whole thing went, and then I‚Äôll go on deep dives of this person and their friends social media to hurt myself over and over again. 

I continuously remind myself of how they don‚Äôt remember me probably and dont care for me at all anymore. Yet I wish they wouldn‚Äôt reach out ever and I know I‚Äôm done with them, but it‚Äôs so easy to trigger myself and get right back to where I was initially after them leaving.

Is this a common BPD thing? I think it mainly stems from boredom when I‚Äôm not dating around and hyperfocus on old flings of mine. But it still brings about the same amount of emotional torment from before and absolutely triggers me.",Bpd
" 

My long time friend came over to visit for two weeks and we got into a big argument because I tell myself that he doesn't care about me and that I might as well fuck everything up now since I know I'm going to fuck it all up later. He left to his uncles house, which is understandable, but at the same time I wanted him back because I don't actually want to be alone and I couldn't stop crying. I got really upset and sent his girlfriend a sex video of us and told her he likes to have her on the phone while having sex with other people, which is true, and I know it's out of line for me to do that but in my head at the moment I just thought I'm not seeing him again anyway so I'm going to extra fuck everything up. Now I can't stop crying because I know I really fucked up now but at the same time I wasn't going to see him again anyway. I don't know what to do.

He's hurt me a lot in the past too but I don't want to make excuses. I didn't want to feel abandoned again and I knew it would happen so I self sabotaged and now I'm like why the fuck did I DO THAT??

I know this post is all over the place but I really can't think straight right now. Let me know if I need to clarify something or something like that. I just want to calm down and move on and stop thinking about it. I knew it was going to happen anyway so I shouldn't be feeling like this.",Bpd

I was alone with my parents at home during covid and they completely neglect me. They do enough to make themselves feel like good parents but I felt completely invisible. So I have some sympathy for the attention seekers at times because maybe they were just constantly ignored.

The last time we hung out, I subtly described to him that he's my favorite person. I didn't use any bpd terms, but I just sort of told him how much I appreciate and admire him, and how I find myself relying on him and being dependent on him often.
He didn't seem weirded out, he even reciprocated a bit. He told me stuff like ""I love hanging out with you too."" ""I love being friends too.""
He told me that... so why? Why is he ignoring me?
CW: self harm ideation

 It hurts so badly, it hurts so badly I've been wanting to cut to just make the pain physical.
I don't understand why he would say such sweet and nice things to me and immediately ignore me for 2 weeks.

I've been telling myself over and over how much I hate him and how much I want to cut him out completely.
But it's not true...I really don't want to cut him out. I want to stay friends and I want to be someone he can rely on too.
I'm IN LOVE with him. I love him so much it hurts me every day because I can never have him and I'm wasting my time.

I'm kept up at night thinking about what I might have done wrong.
I might have scared him away? Maybe he didn't mean all those nice things he said, he must have only said them to quell me.

I honestly would rather he tell me he thinks I'm a freak and that he never wants to speak to me again...instead of doing whatever this is.

"hi. 

i don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôm doing here and i‚Äôve never posted before, but i guess maybe i just needed to brain dump. i‚Äôll prob delete this.  

but anyway, i‚Äôm 28 and was diagnosed with bpd about 6 months ago. honestly i was relieved. i felt like finally there was an explanation for why i feel and act the way i do. my fianc√© (been together for 10 yrs) was super supportive and we were gonna tackle this thing together. ever since i got my diagnosis i do feel worse though. like things that i‚Äôm working through are closer to the surface and more easily triggered in a sense. i don‚Äôt feel like myself anymore. 

my fianc√© is great. i love him more than anything. but we‚Äôre getting married at the end of the year and he‚Äôs terrified. he‚Äôs staring down the barrel of the rest of his life with someone who‚Äôs not quite the person he fell in love with. just a shell of her. and because of this, his fuse is short and his patience is thin. we‚Äôre fighting nonstop and i feel like reality is slipping away from me. as if i ever really had a grasp on reality lol. but we‚Äôll fight and i won‚Äôt remember what i said, or how something went down, or i‚Äôll make something up and FULLY believe that is the way the events unfolded, when it actually is not. and no, he‚Äôs not gaslighting me. 

honestly that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg for how disjointed i feel. i‚Äôm trying so hard and it really is not good enough. like i‚Äôm not getting encouraging results. and i‚Äôm scared it will never be good enough to give him the stable partner he deserves. because even though i folded clothes today, which is a win for me, our relationship is still in shambles and he is hurting deeply. so fuck the laundry. but i still need to celebrate my little wins you know?

lately he has told me he NEEDS to know that things are going to be ok. i don‚Äôt know how to respond to this bc i have no idea if things are going to be ok. all i know is that he and our relationship mean the world to me and i‚Äôll never stop fighting for a happy life together. i just feel so far from that and i have absolutely no fucking idea what to do.",Bpd
"Hey. So life is pretty rough and has been getting progressively worse for the last 8 years. Lately I've been getting literally spirals from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep. Every single day. It's causing so many issues for me to even function. I try coping mechanisms, deep breathing doesn't help. It's stopping me from doing anything creative... The finished project just ends up a disaster because I can't get into any kind of flow which only makes me belittle myself more. 

Sadly I don't really have any support I can go to. I'm in therapy but sadly I can only have a session every few weeks. I don't have any friends or a family i can speak to. Meditation I try to get in when I can (I'm in a chaotic house with no privacy) it sometimes helps but usually the spiral over runs it and often the house is too loud. 

I'm also unemployed with no money so getting out to get a coffee or something isn't an option. Walks in nature help but often the spirals come back the moment I get home. I would happily do them for longer but I'm worried it'll get to the expense of my daily life. 

I'm spamming this group lately because I'm getting into these spirals and I don't know what else to do with that cursed mindset... It makes it worse anyway, but by the time I'm ready want to go to sleep my brain is going the ""just end it"" route really intensely every single day.

"I hate everything, I met this girl five months ago and we got attached to each other, we chatted every single day for hours and it meant so much to me to have her, because no one else was there for me like her. But of course with time, she started being very distant and I felt she was abandoning me and I told her and I tried everything for her not to leave me. 

I think she started hating me because I was so emotionally attached. And I don't know if I was imagining it all, but I messed everything up back then and it hurt so much. I just hated myself, because of all the harm I may have brought to her when I felt I hated her, all the jealousy and horrible feeling I had, that caused fights.

We took some time apart from each other, which hurt because I only felt happy the days we talked. I tried to distance my thoughts from her and talk to other people. A month ago I thought I was completely okay and she wasn't my favourite person anymore.

 We started to talk again and we were pretty good friends for a while until I felt I had feelings for her. I had fallen in love, and she was my everything. It felt so good and I thought I was finally okay. Yesterday she hadn't answered a text of mine for hours, and I wasn't mad. But I realized she may have been active talking to other people without answering me and I started hating her. I blocked her and I just wanted to cry.

I just don't understand. It hurts so much to feel uncertain about what I feel, I didn't feel love, she is still my FP and I was idealising her. I don't know what's wrong with me. I hate myself, why did I react like this? Why does it affect me so much? I wish I had never met her, it hurts so much. I don't want her to be my FP. I don't want any. I wish I felt things normally.

"Hi all! I've been on this sub before, but I left a while back because of the whole, y'know, denial thing that anything is actually wrong and putting blinders on. You know how it is.

I've been a total piece of crap to my husband, who has been my biggest champion for YEARS. I've allowed myself to be a total slave to my illness and basically refused to do anything to better myself. I didn't feel that I needed it, but holy shit I do. On top of that, I've discovered that while not diagnosed, I do actually fit the NPD criteria. Not fun in. The. SLIGHTEST. But it really explains a LOT and knowing about narcissistic rage answers a lot of questions, which helps.

I've lost all of my friends and family and while my husband still loves me and cares for me, he is so hurt by everything I've put him through. I am at a crossroads in my life: I either keep putting fingers in my ears and insisting that I don't need to change, and thus getting divorced and being completely alone, *or*, I can make the damn changes, make amends, and have the family, friends, and husband I love, want, and need.

It's time to make my indecisive ass choose something for once.

For those of you who have successes and have been able to make amends in damaged relationships, and have made changes in yourself; what are some ways I can be better about my illness and more aware of the effect I have without hiding from it? How can I be a better person for the people who love me dearly, but are very tired and hurt?

"Hey everyone.  I am undiagnosed but interested in finding out more about BPD and its treatment. Can anyone suggest some resources for me?

"I feel like I can't see clearly and I don't know if I'm in the wrong or not anymore.

Yesterday my husband and I got in an argument. I feel like I don't get any time for myself (we have an 8 month old and a dog that just had major surgery. My husband is off work with an injury for the last 4 months)
I was up with our son at 6am. Got him ready for the day, let out the chickens, come back in and made pancakes for everyone. When breakfast was ready he said didn't  feel good (injury I assume) and took his breakfast out on the deck and smoked a joint (its around 8am by now). This was a bit upsetting to me as I thought we would have breakfast together...and why is he smoking weed so early? I don't know, I was a bit sulky. He stayed out there for about an hour then came in to start his physio. For whatever reason, this took until 2pm or later. I was gradually getting more upset and feeling more and more  like my time doesn't matter and I'm just expected to be the one that takes care of the baby, makes the meals, cleans the house etc.
These have been ongoing feelings for me since our son was born. 
I am the one getting up throughout the night and in the mornings.  I put him to bed and feed him his meals and give him baths and get him dressed. I feel like I'm not asking a lot to have a couple of hours to myself once in a while. 
Around 4 kiddo had a nap so I went to get some gardening done. Finally. 
This argument isn't over though, we don't talk for the rest of the night. He watches the baby for an hour when he wakes from nap. 6:30 rolls around and I come in to get our son, feed  him dinner  and get him in bed for 8:30. I go straight to bed as well. 

This morning I woke up at 6. Husband is already up. Try to go into kitchen to get coffee going going breakfast for our kid. He shoves me and tells me to fuck off. Told him I have to get breakfast for our son and he picks up a box of baby food pouches and throws them at me..  after this I take our son and go into the bedroom and lock the door. I was in an extremely abusive relationship in my early 20s and this behaviour scares me. He starts blasting really aggressive music and said if I turn it off he will end me...
All of this seems like a completely irrational and aggressive reaction to a pretty normal argument for new parents to have.
He then told me he pulled wires under the hood of the car so I can't leave. I wasn't trying to, but this is also scary for me. We only have one vehicle currently and live rurally. 
The music is still blasting, I'm hiding in the bedroom trying to keep it together.
Music is blasting for about 2hrs while he does his physio. Then, before he leaves he bangs on the door until I open it since he would just come in through the door that goes onto the deck if I didn't. He says some incredibly hurtful things, like, that I deserved to be abused by my ex (he fractured my skull and almost killed me) and that I am exactly like my mother (who I have been estranged from since I was 12)
Then he said he 'definitely didn't piss on my toothbrush'...? Needless to say I have thrown it out...

Then he takes the car and leaves. 

I want to tell you, I have definitely caused my fair share of problems in the history of our relationship. I have CPTSD, depression, and of course, BPD. I am on medication and have gone to therapy and have come a long way in the last 6 years.
My question is... did I cause this? 
Did I bring this upon our marriage and upon my beautiful son with things I have done in the past?
Am I not understanding that I hurt him somehow the day before by being upset? 

Will I be cursed to not trusting my own feelings forever...?",Bpd
"My fp has been really insensitive towards me these past days. Doing things that trigger me on purpose, ignoring me for hours, saying hurtful and mean things to me for no apparent reason. He does not not have bpd and from my understanding isnt dealing with anything stressful.

He has been texting me WAYYY too little past week whivh has fucked my mentality up a lot. I am currently trying to hheal from trauma from being forced to leave my own home from very late november to late february by the government. I have 5 different government workers harassing me everyday, i cannot catch a break, i dont wanna tell him because i feel embarrassed. Ive asked him multiple times to talk to me more because its harming my state a lot, which he has responded to with ''ill try'' ''alright'' but never doing it. 

yesterday was really bad and i relapsed and he didnt even bother reading abt it(online only fp). he does not pay attention to stuff i say and is fucking insensitive. Hes mean to me for no reason, this has never happened. he used to be the opposite of what hes doing rn. he keeps leaving me on seen and giving half assed neeutral responses. earlier i in a sarcastic way said hes mean to me becaue he left me on seen once again, when i asked a question. he said he doesnt care when i mentioned once again that i hate when he does that bc i start unhealthily overthinking ( he has never done this before). his response broke me, he genuinely word to word said ''if you are gonna get worked up from stuff like this i cant tolerate that'

i dont have friends to talk to, my only friend of 13 years left me and i didnt get a reason. its gonna be his bday in 2 days, i feel like hes gonna ignore me all day. today i had to take a day off and just whined all day abt it. he said he doesnt like talking to me anymore, ''all i do is whine'. i fucking whine becayuse u treat me like trash. i got so worked up i started sobbing out loud again but i gave up. i tried to make a normal convo, since ive been really fucking lonely i asked to do smth with him, he agreed, hes not gonna fucking do it i swear. 

i just want to feel loved once again. i dont understand why he is being so fucking rude to me for no fucking reason, i feel like im going insane. i cant take this anymore, i dont wanna leave him because i still care abt him (in a romantic relationship), (he knows abt my bpd.)",Bpd
"I keep seeing post about people with mentally ill significant others being tired of caring for them and supporting them and it‚Äôs fucking with my mind. On one hand I know he loves me back and has never said anything that suggests he would leave, but on the other I‚Äôm so fucking paranoid and don‚Äôt know how to cope. I was clean from self harming until a few weeks ago when I relapse after having a breakdown in the parking lot of his apartment complex when i was 100% sure he was gonna leave (because he suggested I go home when he saw i was really unwell mentally that day. He was trying to be supportive but I was very closed up and anxious ) 

It‚Äôs like the rational part of my brain tells me I‚Äôm overreacting and i know it‚Äôs true but the irrational part of me keeps telling me that he‚Äôs fed up with me and plans on leaving ASAP. 

On one hand I want him to leave for his own good but if he ever did, I‚Äôd fucking hate myself and resent him (even though I would push him to do it)

I am in therapy and it‚Äôs helped but I‚Äôm just so scared. 

I can‚Äôt even trust my own mind and emotions I fucking hate being alive.",Bpd
"Often times when I‚Äôm by myself, I get triggered into an episode. The internal loneliness takes over and I feel like everyone hates me and I hate them. This results in shutting my boyfriend out and just wanting to be alone. I know that this hurts his feelings but I don‚Äôt want it to. Does anyone else feel/go through this? And if so, how can I stop doing it?",Bpd
"this might sound really weird but i hate the fact i have never been hospitalised for my mental health. The people around me i know with bpd (which is few) have all needed hospitalisation and time in a psych ward (and in absolutely no way is that good) but because of how competitive MH is, i feel so invalid. I feel like i‚Äôm constantly fighting with myself to go further to feel like i am ‚Äúbad enough‚Äù and it‚Äôs such a toxic mindset to be in.",Bpd
"I am completely alone and have no idea what to do. I am pretty sure my sister has npd and my mom doesn‚Äôt fall to far behind, dads dead. If I go to my mom she just says I‚Äôm dramatic and screams at me and imitates me (I wonder why I have bpd?!?) Just giving background why family isn‚Äôt an option. 
I moved into my fianc√©s home, who is now in the psychiatric hospital (no way complaining about that, I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs getting help). 
I have no friends local (best friends over two hrs away) and bc I‚Äôm who I am, can‚Äôt make new ones. &amp; 9 weeks pregnant.

" Every time I get any courage and think I might be worth love, I'm always wrong, I get one chance with a girl every 5-6 years and I always mess it up within the first two weeks from being so insecure from decades of only rejection

How is one supposed to not be an incel when every rejection makes him more insecure, which then makes every woman more disgusted by him?

Am I just supposed to be alone trying my best till one woman is finally desperate enough to look past my insecurity?  I can only do my best, and it has not been good enough for every SINGLE WOMAN THAT HAS EVER SEEN MY FACE.  Because every time I think I could be worth love, that I could actually finally matter, I'm always wrong. I can't imagine how many more years before I'm worth a first date again.",Bpd
"Hi Everyone!

My name is Hannah Kitcey. I am currently getting my doctorate in psychology and doing my dissertation on BPD. I think that lack of adequate research and people who are actually diagnosed with BPD being left out of research (not getting the space to tell their stories) is what leads to a lot of misunderstandings and stereotypes. I want this research to be useful as a whole but also to each individual who chooses to participate.  Below is a little about my project.

**Who**: Individuals ages 18+, currently have or have had a BPD diagnosis

**What you will be doing**: 1 interview aimed at understanding your unique perspectives and experiences; 1 debrief meeting involving artistic elements 

**Time**: Meeting times will be determined by the comfort and schedule of the participant, not to exceed 1-2 hours  

**Location**: online available for safety and participant comfort (Zoom platform)

**Why**: To use personal narratives and artistic exploration to create open dialogue

If you are interested in being a participant in my study or have any questions, please reach out to me on here or via my email [hgkitce@pointpark.edu](mailto:hgkitce@pointpark.edu)",Bpd
"I‚Äôve been very insecure about my abilities and intelligence these days but I‚Äôve always considered myself more intelligent and talented than others especially since a lot of people told me that. The insecurities that I‚Äôm in reality dumber than those expectations led me to become somewhat of a perfectionist, where I literally spend hours correcting a few paragraphs and realize that it makes so little difference and I just wasted two hours for nothing. Does anyone else feel this way?",Bpd
"I have an extremely unstable sense of self. I find ""stereotypes"" and while I feel like I belong in that role while I'm playing it, I ultimately believe after I'm sick of/finished playing that role that it isn't ""me."" These roleplaying ""phases"" (for lack of a better word) can last anywhere from hours to months, and at this point my life is revolving around playing these certain roles and creating these narratives. 

Even though my traits can be static, they also change around these roles. My speaking, mannerisms, and even coping skills change with each persona I put on. I also dress up my body and change it to fit the narrative I'm creating. I even tailor things as small as my phone homescreen and my music ""taste"". I don't know how to know who I actually am or what my role is in the world. I know I'm a teenager and that's apparently a teenager thing to do but I don't notice anyone else struggling so outwardly with it, and their personality traits stay relatively the same. 

Am I ever going to know what my actual personality is or if I even have one? 

(If I flared this incorrectly please let me know and I will follow instructions on how to fix/amend that.)",Bpd
"I don‚Äôt know exactly how to explain it, it‚Äôs like a gnawing feeling where the entire world including inside myself, just seems and feels a lot darker. 

I‚Äôm still able to do normal things and think normally, no thoughts of self-harm or anything, but it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt find the light. Like nothing ever mattered and ever will including me. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs splitting because I don‚Äôt see everything as good or bad or act out at all.",Bpd
"i get horrible panic attacks about it, crying and hyperventilating.

people want to be alone sometimes, they might not be having a good day (nothing to do with me), i know all that. in my head i still think ‚Äûwell if it has nothing to do with me, why are they not being nicer to me?‚Äú this is incredibly self centered thinking but the more i try to push those thoughts and feelings away the more they come out and i‚Äòm left feeling miserable.

if i ask people if they‚Äòre upset with me and they say no i assume they‚Äòre lying, so they can‚Äòt really do anything to make it ‚Äûright‚Äú for me.

i can lay it out logically in front of me. (‚Äûwhy should they be mad?‚Äú). i can ask someone to talk it through with me, ask them for input. but then i feel annoying and pathetic.

"hi! just wondering what my fellow BPD-havers are going through, hopefully you all are doing okay :)

"Therapys just become more negative for me than anything. It's just a weekly reminder that my life is how it is and it's not going to change. My therapists definitely shit but what difference is a better therapist going to make. They aren't magicians.

All that's happened is that I've come to accept my life is how it is. I'm always going to feel like this. I'll never make any more friends and the close friends I used to have will probably never speak to me again, even though I'd love to keep in touch with them more than anything.

Even my therapist said that ""it sounds like I've got nothing left to live for"". What else is there to do other than carry on living every day like this",Bpd
"I have set up daily goals that I want to achieve each day. I keep them in my notes app. I've went and set an alarm to check them in the morning and one to review them at night since my memory is so poor. 

I'm really proud of myself. One of my goals has been keeping in contact with family. So far I've been able to text at least one member in my family everyday!!! Instead of being MIA for 6 months straight with the occasional ""how are you? Good. Good"". My next goal is to text my sister at least once a week. 

My family was really toxic and disjointed. Having this open line of communication can't erase the past, but I hope it will unlock at path to a good future with them.",Bpd
"I am very grateful to be on disability because I know that so many people struggle for years to be approved, but it is a very little amount of money, and I am stressed to the hilt trying to provide for myself + my daughter. Every purchase I make is stressful - counting out every dollar for each month all the way down to how many slices of bread I have to make sandwiches. I want to work at least casually because I think I could handle it if I was in a low stress sort of environment where I could sign up for hours when I'm okay and then just not take shifts when I'm not, but my shrink + doctor keep getting frustrated with me when I mention wanting to at least volunteer to test out my ability to handle some form of work. They keep reminding me of how quickly I can get overwhelmed + how easy it is to be kicked off of disability and that working shouldn't be my priority right now since I've only recently stabilized. I wish I could make them live on what I'm living on right now just for a week. Maybe then they'd realize why this is a priority for me and offer more support and encouragement. It's either be stressed about money or be stressed about work. There's no low stress option. I don't have family to rely on. There's nobody buying us gifts or dropping off groceries. It's just me + this tiny amount of cash each month that needs to cover what my daughter and I need. The amount of time I spend googling free bread donations, clothing drives, etc... has to be the same amount of time I would be spending on working a shift or two each month. Honestly. 

I just hope someone on here understands.",Bpd

last week something happened that really triggered me to go into this awful fucking episode and i can't get out of it. i'm depressed, anxious, angry. i feel closer to ending my life than i ever have before. i'm scared and lost an hurt and so tired of being let down by everyone.",Bpd
"I despise the fact that I can't normally enter into relationships. It just doesn't work for me to love someone unless I make them my FP. Either I'm all in or I'm not at all interested. I've only ever had two love interests who became my fps, and it's fucking torture, they both ended badly too. It's so bad that I don't even try to date anymore because either I tell myself I like that person and then unknowingly treat them like dogshit because I don't actually like them, or I like someone so much that I would literally kill myself for them even if they don't like me back. How can i date/love someone without making them my FP? i feel like it's impossible, i feel like the only way i can truly prove to myself that i love them is if i go insane over it and obsess and make them my world. I also expect the same from them, which is unrealistic, but I end up spiraling out of control and attacking them when they don't reciprocate my feelings. I despise it so much. I honestly want to feel love in a way that isn't insane and extreme, that is peaceful and calming, and that doesn't suck the fucking life out of me.",Bpd
"Title pretty much says it all. I made a mistake and now I‚Äôm pregnant. I haven‚Äôt told him yet. For context, I am 28 years old and so is my boyfriend. We both have stable, well paying jobs and a relatively stable relationship. He is 100% my FP but through therapy, I‚Äôve done a good job at controlling these feelings and managing them. I do now, suddenly fear he is going to abandon me. 

I have also been relatively stable for a few years now, to the point where my therapist even jokingly told me that my BPD was ‚Äúin remission.‚Äù But I still fear that I will not be a good mother with BPD. 

I am terrified of 1) going off my medications 2) telling my boyfriend and 3) becoming a mother with mental illness. 

Abortion is not an option for me. I don‚Äôt think I could go through with adoption. I desperately want to be a mom someday, but this was so unexpected. I really don‚Äôt know what to do or think.

"I haven't been diagnosed with BPD yet because I'm under 18, but I've talked to my therapist and she said I definitely exhibited symptoms. I usually start splitting around the holiday season, and my boyfriend of around 1¬Ω years is having to deal with it. The constant switching of my emotions and constantly asking him to leave and then saying I'll take my life if he does is so confusing. All of my feelings are so intense that being alive feels unbearable. I tried journaling last night but I just feel even worse after doing it. I just wish I could be normal and feel my feelings like every other highschooler, but instead I'm stuck like this forever and I hate it.",Bpd
"I just found out I‚Äôm pregnant. I‚Äôve been ‚Äúcasually dating‚Äù this guy for only a couple months now. He‚Äôs not even technically my boyfriend. But he sure as hell is my FP. I‚Äôm not on birth control and participated in some risky sexual behavior‚Ä¶ and well, here we are. 

After a few days of thinking about it, I know I‚Äôm not going to have an abortion and I‚Äôm going to have this baby. I haven‚Äôt told him yet and I‚Äôm terrified how he‚Äôs going to react. 

This entire situation is super tricky because of the BPD and the favorite person aspect. I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôm capable of being a good mom with this disorder. 

I also take 3 medications - all of which have huge warnings against taking during pregnancy. So I just went off them cold turkey. 

I really need advice and support. Especially what to do if he reacts poorly. I can‚Äôt handle the idea of being abandoned by him and then having his baby.",Bpd

"So we cut back on my Seroquel and I‚Äôve been doing so much better. Decided we to try propanol for heightened GAD instead.

Last night I decided to take it upon myself to just cut it out altogether. Not sure if it‚Äôs just a coincidence or if it‚Äôs related but today I‚Äôm Uber depressed, very suicidal.

I really just want to kill myself today

My stomach is so nauseous

Heightened anxiety

Can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôm a bad person

What if I really don‚Äôt care about people

And all I care about is how they make me feel or what they can do for me

That thought is traumatizing

I don‚Äôt want to be a manipulator

I don‚Äôt want to hurt people or use them for my benefit

What if I can‚Äôt ever love and feel real empathy

What if I‚Äôll always be a sad selfish person concerned with my own despair

I don‚Äôt even want to tell people how I feel anymore

I‚Äôm so sick of saying the same thing and hearing the same shit

A broken record on repeat

I know im annoying, and I don‚Äôt want to be a burden

I want to be the reason people smile, to be someones safe haven

But all I ever do is use people

Im haunted by past memories, throwing away friends for male attention

Whoever was a gateway for guys, my drug

Treating people like pawns Just to get my fix

Desperately desiring attention Because it made me feel like whole

I wasn‚Äôt a person without someone else

Reminding me of who I was

And sometimes I still feel this way
Like an addict in relapse

Remind myself I don‚Äôt need anyone else

But the emptiness makes me an emotional mess

As long as I have someone to love, to please
To care for

Or as long as someone else is showering me with the attention and validation I need

Then I‚Äôm complete

But without, its like a drought

No idea who I am

Im so sorry, please forgive me

I don‚Äôt want to be this way anymore",Bpd
"Abilify (Aripiprazole) has shown some clinical effectiveness in treating borderline personality disorder.

And let me just say, these magic little tic tacs have made a world of difference for me, when combined with therapy and my antidepressant. A year ago, my romantic relationship was particularly triggering, and I was prone to episodes of rage and self harm. I felt horribly inadequate, alien and at a constant risk of being abandoned.

Nowadays, my moods are steadier, without any sense of being ""zombified."" It feels like I have a chance to practice some self-soothing exercises when I'm feeling triggered, as opposed to suddenly flying into blinding, red-hot fury or a suicidal spiral of desperate sadness. My self perception is also a lot more rational- I still see my faults, but they don't seem world-ending, anymore. The people around me seem more accepting, trustworthy and empathetic. 

Even if they're not prescribed Abilify, I highly recommend that anyone who is feeling ""stuck"" in their current treatment speaks to their psychiatrist about treatment options. I had to specifically ask about them, months after my diagnosis, to start the conversation. 

It's worth it, and so are you.",Bpd
"There is one guy in the group who takes up a lot of space. They talk loudly and they talk over other people but they are also put in heaps of time and energy and have great ideas. So the intention is good but sometimes poorly executed. Today, they were sharing another idea and someone was responding to their idea and they spoke over them. I responded to the other person and then he got angry at me. I got angry back and pointed out that he does this all the time. Two other ppl backed me up. Another male in the group said I was out of line and that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to respond anymore and now it was his turn. I tried to point out he was being unfair. I was angry. He told me to shut up. I walked away.

Feeling super alone. I stand by everything I said but it was really not an effective way to communicate. It would be really great if this guy (who has the ideas) could give more space to others because then we could actually work together instead of him feeling like he does all the work. If I want ti point this out to him, I need to do it in a safe level way. Not in front of the group. I‚Äôm just frustrated.

My FP ordered food without asking if I wanted anything. We were sitting beside each other. It wouldn't have taken much extra thought to consider me.

"I was diagnosed with BPD last year and it has put a lot of things in my life into context. Since then, I have noticed that I swing from either a highly empathetic person, ie. crying with someone I know when they're experiencing grief, or feeling randomly angry at someone I deeply love getting upset. 

I find it ESPECIALLY difficult to empathize after I split on someone or have impulsive behaviours in my relationship. After the event has happened, I try to put myself in their shoes to try and resolve things. Yet I see myself in such a bad light anyway that feeling the pain I've caused them is enough to make me suicidal. So, it's like my brain just can't go there, like a mental block.

"i I have BPD and I've been a relationship with my boyfriend for 6 months and we've known each other for a year. We dated for 3 months before but he lied to me about relatively small stuff so we broke up for a couple of months and then I took him back. I've been having serious doubts about the relationship for about a month but I'm worried that it's my bpd that's acting up and making me push him away.

My main problem is that we constantly bicker and have been doing so for months. We seem to annoy each other all the time. I'm not sure we have that much in common and I'm not physically attracted to him. But I've previously had two separate relationships that both lasted for 2 years and he treats much better than both my exes. I know that he feels strongly for me. We also work together so it's easier to continue the relationship for that reason. I also really like his family and would miss them a lot if we broke up. My family also loves him. I've also grown attached to his cat.

Even with all the bickering this is still the healthiest relationship I've been in and I want to make sure that my bpd isn't making me ruin it.",Bpd
"how many other people with BPD experience crippling and all consuming loneliness? i literally almost never get texted or called first or checked in on. people say they like me/value me but i‚Äôm not sure how much bc i‚Äôm always out of the loop and not contacted. it‚Äôs not that i‚Äôm necessarily alone, but i feel alone. i‚Äôm just so empty, even when i feel ‚Äúok‚Äù. i know people can‚Äôt really fill that void, and that doesn‚Äôt make it hurt any less. hookups definitely don‚Äôt fill anything either. i just can‚Äôt genuinely connect/feel connected to people. on top of all that i really don‚Äôt know how to talk to people. i‚Äôve gone to therapy and treatment for over 2 years now i really want this loneliness to end in an ok way but it‚Äôs becoming unbearable.",Bpd
"Decided to go abroad on a whim after a kinda recent breakup, wanting to gain some new experiences and just simply meet and hangout with new people. Reserved a bed in a hostel that‚Äôs more targeted to people wanting to meet new people, and I‚Äôm feeling like everyone here hates me..

Or more like, I can only hang out with/ talk to people once before they realise what kind of a shitty and weird person I am, start looking at me weirdly, whisper ‚Äúhey‚Äù, smile awkwardly and go away. Good thing this is a place where people come, hang out for a few days and then leave to be replaced by new people. However, it also made me realise how my normal life at home is similar..

This realisation that I‚Äôm having is heartbreaking, and I don‚Äôt feel like I can take it. Like, I want someone to attach to so bad.. I feel so hopeless and tired and sad and just, I don‚Äôt know.. I just need a hug, I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore and my plane isn‚Äôt until Sunday.. üò≠",Bpd

"TW: Contains brief mentions of abuse, including sexual. No examples or details though. 

Disclaimer: I'm aware men are also diagnosed with BPD, albeit rarely. I'm also aware not all PTSD is caused by the actions of men. This is simply my experience and interpretation informed by the misogynistic roots of BPD. 


I don't have a ""fear of abandonment"" but if I did, the actions of my dad would've been the cause of that. He remained married to my mum for 20 years, 19 of which I grew up within, whilst maintaining a second secret family with two children that he prioritised more than us. My own dad lied to my face most days throughout my childhood and teenage years, gaslighted me, made me feel embarrassed and uncomfortable for asking questions as simple as ""where exactly do you live when you work away, dad?"" or ""what do you do at your job?"". When he finally divorced my mum, he did so only after being confronted by me putting the pieces of his lies together. He continued to deflect, deny and lie so naturally I blamed myself for the end of the marriage. Even though I was right all along. 


My entire upbringing was built on manipulation and emotional abuse. Meanwhile, my mum had untreated mental health issues and took out her anger on me verbally, sometimes physically, and neglected me. I never felt heard or understood. I felt like I couldn't trust anything I was seeing or hearing. Is it any wonder I started to experience dissociation, derealisation, depersonalisation, and imbalanced emotions? 


Looking back, my ""symptoms"" flared up: after the revelation of my dad's secrets, when I was bullied at school, whenever I was sexually or emotionally abused by a man, whenever someone blatantly tried to deceive me despite the evidence being glaring, whenever someone twisted my words or actions to fit their narrative. Whenever my optimistic worldview is shattered, or my perception of reality is denied, that's when I can't cope with this world we live in. That's when I feel like I wasn't meant for this world. 


I don't feel shame over my diagnosis anymore. I took responsibility for my future; I didn't blame anyone else for the mess my life has devolved into. I did DBT and many other forms of therapy, I sobered up, I threw myself into regular exercise and began building a solid routine. I removed people from my life who were causing me distress; I removed myself from any disagreements that were spiking my adrenaline. 


I barely cry anymore and, when I do, it isn't hysterical or in an inappropriate moment. I don't shout, scream, slam doors, or spam people with texts or calls. I've realised that if someone wants to exit my life, that's for a valid reason and will result in a better life for both of us. I'm content on my own. I don't mind that I don't have many friends or a really small family. I enjoy spending time with myself and my cats. I do have a boyfriend but I don't at all worry about him cheating or leaving. I don't feel insecure or jealous. I've been this way for over two years now. 


Funny how my personality isn't ""disordered"" at all. My personality is kind, lovely, bubbly, excitable, optimistic. My personality values the importance of true connection to animals, humans, nature - and to myself and my values. My personality is independent, self-reliant, motivated, introverted. My personality isn't ""emotionally unstable"". 


All I had to do was stop seeking validation, understanding, and empathy from those incapable of providing it. To radically accept that everything happens for a reason. Most importantly, to stop tolerating abuse from men. To stop re-traumatising and hurting myself. To understand that I was never the problem. No child is to blame for the method of coping they select in response to ongoing abuse. 


Disclaimer #2: I'm not at all suggesting we don't have responsibility for our behaviour as an adult, or that we don't have to work to change so that we can be happier. We, of course, must do both. For ourselves. But that doesn't mean we are to blame for the patterns that began to form before we were old enough to practice self-actualisation. We are also not to blame for these patterns continuing into adulthood whilst we're still confused, distressed, frightened, and traumatised. It's straight-up victim-blaming to blame our inherent personalities for our responses to trauma. The blame for this ""disorder"" lies solely with the perpetrators of abuse. Men are treated for their PTSD without being blamed for placing themselves in a situation that exposed them to war, abuse, etc. Women are accused of being emotionally unstable and hysterical, and called ""bad people"", ""unwilling to change"", and ""manipulative"" for struggling with the effects of traumatic situations that were in no way their own fault. It's horrifying, misogynistic, and disgusting. 


Maybe psychiatry should be addressing the impact of men's (and women's, but in my case mostly men's) abusive actions on women and children, and how this leads to detrimental rewiring of the developing or vulnerable brain. 


Funny how I'm not emotionally unstable at all when I'm not being abused.",Bpd
"I have BPD and I often find myself having moments of crippling anxiety that my partner will at some point cheat either emotionally or sexually. He is an amazing man, never given me a reason to doubt him or even think he‚Äôd look at someone else, and when I step back and think about it, the thought of him cheating is unrealistic. The relationship is beautiful and I‚Äôm so happy. Even with all that, some days I am so convinced I am not the one for him and he will figure it out and cheat or leave or something.

"So on a forum I am on someone was commenting about their BPD partner. Which was fine, made sense as the way his partner was acting was out of order. 

Anyway one of the comments basically said how BPD people were doomed to hurt, couldnt get better and people and to avoid them. I replied saying this was all false basically. And that their views were quite bias and stigmatizing. 

Now being downvoted. And I just feel deflated. I know it's just strangers on the internet. It's not that that is upsetting. It's that these stigmatizing views are genuinely what the majority of people think. 

How can pwBPD begin to get better if we are constantly told we are bad, unlovable, abusive people? It's so depressing.",Bpd
Couldn‚Äôt find anything on the topic but I was wondering if anyone else has felt disconnected from their ethnic background? I know things like wanting to change your name or looks often occur with identity disturbance but I always struggled with feeling like I was born into the wrong country. Especially when I was a kid/teenager I would spend time with kids of different backgrounds and I would feel like I didn‚Äôt fit in cause I was of different ethnicity to them so I would make up things about my background to ‚Äúbe cooler‚Äù. Some countries I‚Äôve been more infatuated with than others and if I had friends from that country I would try to prove to them that I knew heaps about their traditions and could say things in their language and would feel inferior cause I couldn‚Äôt really be one of them‚Ä¶ which is so dumb cause obviously I can‚Äôt just change my ethnicity. But I have dreamt of just moving somewhere and assimilating to the point of passing for a local. I understand that it can be problematic as well since cultural appropriation and racism are huge issues but I was just interested to hear if anyone can relate?,Bpd
So yeah. Is this normal? I read ab BPD and I have like every sign and like all the traumas that cause it too. But also I‚Äôm j anxious and depressed and adhd and ptsd and then also mild paranoia and dissociation so idkkk. But when I read these posts they resonate w me like more than anything else. I went to therapy just cus people told me to and it was awful. Later learned my therapist was a duck but he pretty much told me that me being positive was me being fake and then I spiraled down into like binge eating bc I couldn‚Äôt dissociate anymore after therapy. ‚Äò‚ÄòTwas bad. He sort of was saying that me having a positive and bubbly personality was all a show tho. But like now I don‚Äôt think so like underneath was just nothing so I sort of just turned into this depressed fat person. Now I‚Äôm healthy again but it‚Äôs just hard feeling things cus I used to be able to dissociate from all feelings. But idek if I have BPD.,Bpd

"DISCUSSIONS OF SEX, SELF HARM AND SUICIDAL IDEATION S

Saturday night, I went out. Already feeling pretty down. Met a woman at the bar. We went back to her friend's house. Then to mine. Had sexual interactions. I couldn't maintain an erection. So, I was left feeling off. She gave me her instagram details and I sent her a follow request.

She left early the next morning. Then last night. I got super drunk. Gambled and lost a bunch. I tried reaching out to a bunch of people. Then, I turned up at her friend's house. Scared her friend, then I left. I had an implement to harm myself on me. I was going to, with the intention of finality, when I saw a message from a friend I'd called earlier. I called him. He talked me down and I went home. 

This morning. The girl who stayed over told me she'd had fun, but what I did was unacceptable. She wanted no further contact and was considering filing a police report. 

I completely agree. I apologised and told her I understood. Then asked if she could contact the police. I unsent that message and she has since blocked me. I'm in minor financial trouble and frankly despise myself. I'm not currently suicidal. I half-heartedly tried something, but couldn't go through with it.",Bpd

TLDR at bottom with quotes from article.

‚Äî-

I can‚Äôt sleep, so I‚Äôve been laying in bed contemplating my mental health and doing cell phone research. Anyway, came across this article that was REALLY interesting to me.

I‚Äôve never been tested for autism, but I‚Äôve suspected most my life, never tested because parents didn‚Äôt see it and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, then several years later the diagnosis was corrected to bpd, and I just put it off as okay bpd has similar things that‚Äôs all it is.

However, my wife and I both have bpd and we‚Äôve been comparing thought processes and talking about mental health a lot lately. And while we‚Äôre similar, we differ in a lot of ways. There‚Äôs a huge part of my behavior she still can‚Äôt understand when it comes to understanding what‚Äôs appropriate in certain interactions or in the often completely different ways I interpret situations.  It brought me back to thinking maybe it is something more than JUST bpd, so yeah‚Ä¶  the googling.

I put the article at the top and I‚Äôll put it [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5590952/#!po=1.02041) as well.


Basically I‚Äôm not crazy‚Ä¶ 

TLDR: I‚Äôll sum it up with some quotes from the study:

‚Äú‚Ä¶some females with BPD have undiagnosed ASC, due to ASC not being easily detected in females.‚Äù

‚ÄúRecent research is focusing on the possible under-diagnosis or mis-diagnosis of ASC in females [40,41], on the assumption that females may experience greater societal pressure to conform and be part of a peer group and so are more motivated to learn how to hide their autism (so-called ‚Äúcamouflaging‚Äù) and thereby go ‚Äúunder the radar‚Äù of clinicians or school psychologists, by ‚Äúpretending to be normal‚Äù [42]. This may lead to them either receiving their ASC diagnosis far later than males, and/or being diagnosed with other conditions (anorexia, depression, anxiety, or BPD) because clinicians are not looking for how ASC may present itself differently in females.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶found that 6 out of 41 BPD patients fulfilled criteria for ASC.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur findings highlight the need for careful examination for autistic traits in patients referred for an assessment for BPD, especially in those without a history of significant childhood abuse or neglect. Some of these patients may have been misdiagnosed (their ASC was overlooked), and a proportion of them may have both conditions.‚Äù


To put it short‚Ä¶.

Def going to talk to my psych MD about if I can be tested for autism now. Holy crap this article made every thing about me make so much more sense! Now I‚Äôm wide awake too! I mean, last thing I need is ANOTHER diagnosis to add to the pile, but if it helps it helps! So much for research articles putting people to sleep.",Bpd
"the past year has been probably one of the worst years i've ever had in terms of my mental well-being but in the recent few months i've been trying really hard to make progress towards getting better. doing small things for myself even though they're super hard, like getting out of bed and getting dinner or taking a shower. recently i made an appointment to get a haircut, i haven't gotten one in over a year now. 

but despite these small steps i'm taking, i don't feel better at all. i still feel so alone. i still feel so miserable, like i'm drowning in my own thoughts and feelings. i feel like nothing will ever get better. i fear i will be stuck feeling this way for the rest of my life and i don't think i can handle it. i just want to give up already. i don't want to be here anymore. am i supposed to just keep hanging on hoping one day things will be different? i've been doing that my whole life",Bpd

"Hello, 

I just learned that I have BPD. I always knew something was wrong with me. I‚Äôve failed at everything. Relationships, careers, the military ‚Ä¶. I thought my discharge would be a new healthy start‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve been dating my ‚Äúgf‚Äù on and off for over a year now. At the beginning we fought because I always felt like she was hiding something &amp; it would turn into huge fights where she would be upset because I don‚Äôt trust her.

Well long story short, I ended up finding out that she didn‚Äôt disclose a STD about 6 months ago by finding a medication bottle in her apartment and I ended up ghosting her for 3 months because the feelings of betrayal were so strong‚Ä¶. If she would‚Äôve just told me I would‚Äôve  accepted her‚Ä¶ but she made me feel crazy‚Ä¶. She lied to my face &amp; she was still trying to force me to stay in the relationship. I had to go‚Ä¶

I ended up wanting to reconcile things after I took time apart but ever since she‚Äôs been holding me leaving over my head &amp; I know ghosting is wrong but I felt like she wasn‚Äôt respecting my space and pain.

For the past 4 months she‚Äôs been holding me at arms length because she‚Äôs still hurt about how i left her &amp; the ensuing rages i go into don‚Äôt help. I throw things and get verbally abusive . It‚Äôs terrible and i hate myself every time i do it. When I get angry I just want her to admit how messed up it was to gaslight me whenever i used to tell her i had trust issues and i felt like she was hiding something. That really hurt me to the core .

She did eventually  apologize and i said i  forgave her and i thought i did but it is proving so difficult. I‚Äôm so hurt still but i love her beyond her flaws . And it doesn‚Äôt help that i feel like she doesn‚Äôt treat me like she did before. I may be selfish for this but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that she gets to treat me like I‚Äôm the reason the whole relationship tanked and even though we are actively working on trying to fix things, her distance makes me feel so insecure and I‚Äôm not someone worth committing 100% to.

I had been having episodes almost daily trying to get through to her &amp; tell her how i think it‚Äôs unfair how quickly i let her back in but she can‚Äôt do the same for me. It makes me feel like crap.  I stopped drinking because the rages kept becoming worse and she said i was making the relationship toxic. 

Problem is, I‚Äôm still having episodes because I still feel angry for what she did &amp; she blames me for leaving saying i abandoned her but I still came back and am trying to love her despite everything. When i talk about my feelings, it quickly becomes an argument because she says we can‚Äôt move forward because of all the resentment i harbor. The moment she begins to raise her voice i fly into a rage and this last time i think i crossed the line and said some really terrible things i wish i could take back‚Ä¶ She say I‚Äôve been abusive since i met her and I‚Äôm finding it hard to live with that. Yeah she has done her dirt but i think i took it too far last night‚Ä¶I feel as evil as my mother 

We are going on a trip tomorrow that we had originally planned to take to bring us back together but after last night i think I‚Äôm going to tell her goodbye &amp; do things on my own while we are abroad . I feel bad for making her feel like crap and always bringing up the past but I‚Äôm so angry. She knew my past but that doesn‚Äôt excuse the way i have been treating her and now i feel like a monster who can never forgive and will hurt everyone i come across. I get so verbally abusive and reading back on the messages i feel like a very dangerous person &amp; I feel like i don‚Äôt deserve a relationship because they all end so turbeulent.  But she was the first one i actually felt like i fell deeply in love with and vice versa. My trust isn‚Äôt completely ruined after this but piece of me feel like i deserve it from a lot of shit that happened in my past

Idk what I‚Äôm asking here but I‚Äôm packing and trying to prevent myself from spiraling out of control. I guess i needed to vent? I don‚Äôt really talk to my family and don‚Äôt have many ‚Äúclose‚Äù friends who would understand and i don‚Äôt want to disclose information about her health status to them. She was my best friend but I can hear it in her voice that she‚Äôs over me. I think this was the last straw. She said if i actually love her i would be patient with her healing process but i feel like I‚Äôve never gotten that from her myself so i lash out.

I guess I‚Äôm seeking help in with coping with the fact that i think I‚Äôm meant to be alone &amp; finally letting her go. I said terrible things &amp; i can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm that type of person. ‚Ä¶

"47 y/o male. Divorced. In stable relationship now - finally.  

While visiting my parents this weekend, I opened a box which contained painful memories. One was so many letters and cute things from my courtship with my ex-wife and mother of my child. I‚Äôve been able to come to a place where I don‚Äôt fully blame myself for the end of my marriage. I get that it was both of us, only I did the acting out. Of course.

What is more painful tonight is that my mom kept every letter my college ex girlfriend wrote me. Reading back, it‚Äôs so easy to see the pure love she had that was so hard to see then. She was also the one who took the most emotional abuse, when I was at worst and had absolutely zero self-awareness. All these letters and pics showed a genuinely good person who did not deserve any of what I subjected her to, and that is difficult.

It‚Äôs been over 20 years. I since had a 14 year marriage which ended, have a ten year-old son, fell hard, and have gotten up. I have my pain, but I now manage myself better than ever. I have a partner of three years I treat well. I just feel for this woman who so clearly loved me, but got the worst of me, tonight.

We last had contact in about 2005 or 2006. It was still loving and caring, inquiring about each other‚Äôs friends and families.

"Recently diagnosed with BPD after a very short, very traumatic involuntary stay on a psych ward.

I tried explaining to the doctor all of my symptoms to a limited degree of success, I find it difficult to put into words how I‚Äôm feeling/ what I‚Äôm experiencing and he didn‚Äôt seem to have a lot of patience for me which made it more difficult.

I tried to tell him about what I believe were episodes of psychosis, however, he said something or other about how because I‚Äôm ‚Äòaware‚Äô of these episodes, then they can be explained away as my ‚Äòinner dialogue‚Äô. 

He seemed happy with his diagnosis of BPD, and I do tend to agree as most the listed symptoms line up with the symptoms I have been experiencing for years now. 

However, his disregard for my other experiences has left me feeling a bit isolated.

During one episode, a family member told me later that I was ‚Äòincoherent‚Äô and ‚Äòinconsolable‚Äô, having not slept for two days I was ‚Äòwide awake‚Äô and practically bouncing off the walls. I believed that my family were trying to kill me and frame it as a suicide, and I was (apparently) talking to a friend (who wasn‚Äôt there) about ‚Äòthe plan‚Äô. (???).

Recently I‚Äôve been hearing more disturbing things, like jumbled, distorted voices that feel aggressive. This is kind of distressing, but not as distressing as the hostile kicking on the windows and doors. (Which I know isn‚Äôt real, otherwise the dogs would be losing their shit).

As an unmedicated (he took all my meds away, rip.), untreated and dangerously impulsive person, I don‚Äôt feel at all stable right now. Whereas I can currently differentiate between real and not real, I‚Äôm scared that I will spiral back into the state I was in a few months ago and cause my family more grief.

It feels like she sees what I‚Äôm doing and compares it to herself. If I wear new pants she says ‚Äúwhere are they from? How much? Why don‚Äôt I buy myself things like you do?‚Äù. I got annoyed the other day when she wanted me to get her the same shoes I wear so I said ‚Äúmum you have your own identity I‚Äôm sure there are lots of other shoes you‚Äôd like‚Äù and it offended her. She tried to clear this with me on Easter, I apologised and she stopped talking to me and it was awkward as hell. Shes used the line ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to establish new boundaries for our relationship [implying less connection etc‚Äù. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have questioned her identity but I wish I had a mum who had her own taste and timeline. She‚Äôs 53. I hate that she holds resentment for so long. It‚Äôs awfully tiring and I can‚Äôt sleep. Me and my bf can sort issues out more efficiently and it‚Äôs so much healthy.

Feel like I need to be extra careful with what I say. Any advice?",Bpd
"i struggle to describe my moods and emotional states to therapists, because i just feel so numb and outside of my own head. when i‚Äôm upset at work i turn off, but i can feel the hole in my chest and all the tears i‚Äôve swallowed, but i don‚Äôt really FEEL anything. 

i can‚Äôt cry or rage out externally, but i feel like i‚Äôm in a constant state of mourning or seething hatred. i feel this panicked hopeless feeling, but i don‚Äôt really actually feel it. nothing makes me happy, i just find things to hyperfixate on. i just feel like such a shell of a person. the only time i can even manage to tear up is when i watch dumb romantic anime shit and think about how much i would give to just be held for 5 seconds 

does this get better? how do i get back into my body? god even when im listening to music with the windows open i can legitimately feel the wind against this numbness in my chest, and idk how to explain it to anyone without sounding actually insane",Bpd
I have no friends to talk to and I feel like I cant tell my parents anything either. I'm going crazy today and I just wanna dissapear forever and not have to listen to these thoughts in my head anymore. No matter how honest I am in my relationship I feel shut down and being told I'm over dramatic and crazy. Idk what to anymore I feel so alone. No one will ever understand me because I'm too crazy,Bpd
"My boyfriend and I live with my sister and her bf. They threw a potluck. 

My sister is in the kitchen with her friends- small table, 6 people including her are all cramped at the table. He bf is outside with 3 of his friends. My bf and I were in the living room watching tv, watching 3 kids- sort of keeping an eye on them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been drinking so maybe I'm in my feels. But my bf up and left suddenly, and when I asked what was going in he said they were playing good music outside. So he ditched me, all alone, to hand with the guys outside. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like crap because I want him to have a good time, but I am not having a good time. There are too many people and I know from experience I just wont fit in. I'd be a 3rd wheel, metaphorically, with either groups. so I'm alone, in the garage, angry at my bf but also angry at myself because idk if I am justified.",Bpd
"I had a very rough time my entire life in my hometown. About two or so years ago I moved to a different location and have since then been indescribably better. I feel so much more open and happy. 

However, every now and then I see a reminder from my past and it messes with my head, even though I know it shouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs been months since I‚Äôve felt depressed, but I‚Äôm starting to hit another low. I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have the right to feel down because everything is going so well, but I can‚Äôt help but feel empty. 

How do I come to terms with, or stop caring about my past? It can really hurt",Bpd
"I have no idea what is happening to me, but what I'm feeling is absolute emptiness, and despair. I'm numb to everything I think. I hope this feeling ends soon, I've been this way for the past week, it's felt like years though and it's horrific. I'm so tired... So tired. I need a break. I want to sleep and have good dreams. I want to sit still and feel peace. I want to let go of the white hot emotions inside of me. I try and try to let go and to soothe myself, but to no avail. Time after time, the cycle repeats, and I end up in the same place. I don't know why I expect things to be different sometimes. Hope seems so stupid right now. I'm trying to have it, though. I'm so lonely. And being with people makes it worse. Even those who I think I care for.

"I feel like it's a secret I'm not privy to. I've had a few somewhat supportive people in my life, but no one that really understood.

I try so hard to connect to others, but nobody ever taught me how - I even feel uncomfortable asking people out to lunch. I wish I had at least one close person in my life that wouldn't assume I'm okay and would actually ask, and push when I give an obviously dishonest answer. 

I've tried joining groups but they're too big so feeling forgotten and rejected is par the course, triggering dissociation and splitting. I've been thinking about trying to find or create a very small support group, trying to find people to talk to that understand the extremes. I fantasize about this, it feels sad actually.",Bpd
"TW: Drug Use

I have always known I experienced dissociation. But I never was confident in its validity. Like ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs not real and I just experience perception and am dumb.‚Äù

But nay nay nay. I‚Äôll have you know my friend and I took LSA and were sitting on my couch watching music videos when things had really started to kick in. We took it at the same time and had the same amount. After some time I started to experience visuals and ticklish sensations all over, but mentally felt quite normal. So I said ‚ÄúThis stuff is great! I feel basically normal honestly.‚Äù My friend erupted in a semi hearted yell of disbelief and confusion, followed by her saying ‚ÄúDude this is nowhere near normal.‚Äù
I replied with ‚Äúwhat do you mean? Cognitively I feel pretty okay.‚Äù The conversation goes as follows:
E : ‚ÄúThere is nothing cognitively normal about what is happening in my brain right now! What do you mean you feel normal?!‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúWait..you don‚Äôt feel normal rn? Wait are you okay how do you feel?‚Äù
E: ‚ÄúI mean I‚Äôm okay but I‚Äôm not okay. I don‚Äôt know how to explain this but I feel like I‚Äôm not inside my body! Like I am but I‚Äôm not! Like I‚Äôm watching a tv of what my eyes see.‚Äù
Me:‚Äù..you don‚Äôt normally feel like that?‚Äù
E:‚ÄùNO!?‚Äù
Me:‚Äù‚Ä¶I see. Well..you‚Äôre just dissociating, you‚Äôll be fine. I had no idea that wasn‚Äôt normal if I‚Äôm honest with you. This is the first time I‚Äôve had this confirmed from someone outside of my body.‚Äù 
E:‚Äù hoW COULD THIS BE NORMAL?!‚Äù

We still had fun, and enjoyed Oreos. But yeah I wanted to share that because I don‚Äôt really know where else I would find people that also could relate to this.",Bpd
"when i‚Äôm going through major crisises or periods of deep loneliness‚Ä¶ it really helps me cope. feels almost like a hug.   

mine was gifted to me from a former best friend fp and i used to imagine it was a hug from her.

i highly recommend it to all. it‚Äôs not a cure all but it really does help alleviate some pain. helped me get through living alone with a very small support network during covid lockdown. 

10/10 would recommend.",Bpd
I spent time a bit with my boyfriend today and he could not go at least 5 minutes without being on his phone and I can't even tell him how I feel anymore cuz he gets upset and says it ridiculous that he can't be on his phone when he's on it constantly and I can't stand it anymore. Today he was with his family and normally I hear from him... but he didn't really talk to me and I felt really clingy today. He said was playing video games and I got so upset cuz he never feels like playing video games with me. I feel like im losing it üò≠,Bpd
"I would have to say that dissociation is one of my most intense and worst BPD symptoms. This is the one that I find it most difficult to break out of, and I honestly almost never feel real, present, or anything but dissociated. I have tried countless things like extreme temperatures, meditation, and walks outside, but they either haven't helped or made it worse.

I don't want to keep resorting to maladaptive coping mechanisms like SH to fix it. It is so scary sometimes, I feel so numb and disconnected that it borders on being dangerous. 

If you have a similar experience or any advice for me I would really appreciate it. I haven't felt real in years.",Bpd
"Semi-FP (I don't even know), we have a fairly good relationship but I can feel it deteriorate as my mental health gets worse. I used to feel really safe around her. Now it's triggered or almost nothing. She's acted the same consistently.

She just slightly triggered me today. I let her know I was triggered. Not that it was by her. Where to now? I want to come up with a way she can not trigger me in the figure but I can't put my finger on the exact thing that's triggering me, it's just my thoughts over a completely normal interaction. I'm scared and I don't want to lose the progress I made in trusting her.",Bpd
I know self-diagnosis is bad and frowned upon but I‚Äôve felt for some time that my mental health issues are a lot more complex than anxiety and depression and I have a lot of signs of BPD. I‚Äôve felt it‚Äôs the only disorder that actually resonates with me. But I‚Äôm not sure about getting a diagnosis of BPD/EUPD via the NHS and wondered if anybody had any experience? I feel like I‚Äôm just escalating and I need help.,Bpd
"So‚Ä¶ I mean I‚Äôm really only broken up over one of the instances, but the second mimicked the first and it kinda sucks.

To make a very long story short, I dated this girl for a few months in 2019. She has BPD, too. It felt like a feedback loop. Something would happen, she‚Äôd get upset and accuse me, I‚Äôd get offended and get snippy, she‚Äôd yell at me, I‚Äôd yell at her. She hit me once, was emotionally abusive, pressured me into sex multiple times, crossed my boundaries, threaten to break up with me or to kill herself, SH and make me help her clean it up. I would ignore her when she upset me to piss her off, I would SH and tell her about it, basically it was just really fucked up on all fronts.

It got to a point where she was completely dependent on me to get her through episodes, but she was never there for me when I needed help. I ended up breaking up with her, because I couldn‚Äôt even handle my own mental health, so it was making it worse to try to handle both of ours at the same time.

I felt like I was dying. I‚Äôve tried to hard to rationalize; that I left because it was unhealthy and it was only getting worse as time went on. But I was so sick of myself, I hated myself for leaving her, and it felt like I was literally dying. Like I would never be happy again.

New scenario, much less serious, just a friend, but I‚Äôve decided to walk away because it‚Äôs very one-sided and it feels like she‚Äôs using me for the things i buy her. I‚Äôm less torn up about walking away from this relationship, but it‚Äôs reminding me if my ex and is reopening that wound.

How do I still feel like I‚Äôm dying and being alone forever when I‚Äôm the one who left ? I‚Äôm so fucking tired of this shit.",Bpd
"We‚Äôre both in our 30‚Äôs and live in separate states. We both have no family left because most are either suicides or other(mental illness runs very deep in my family).


She‚Äôs on her phone all the time. She doesn‚Äôt even open my texts for days and sometimes weeks. I‚Äôm trying so hard to push through his splitting thing with her but it ignites this fire in me.


I also feel ashamed that I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs and I get mad at my sister for not getting back to me in a timely manner. This has been going on for YEARS though. The thing is, my brain decided a long time ago that I don‚Äôt even want to talk to her, but I try to because I feel bad for her. I want her to know she still has family. I‚Äôm here. But I don‚Äôt want to be here. And the weird times she does text me, I really don‚Äôt even want to talk to her. Not even because of the texting thing, but just because I don‚Äôt care about her being in my life.


I don‚Äôt know what to feel. Well, I take that back. I know what to feel, but I guess I *need to know what I SHOULD feel*.  She‚Äôs the only family member I have left but that fact means very little to me. I‚Äôm ok with being alone with my husband and dogs. Honestly, I prefer it that way.


I swear I‚Äôm not heartless I just don‚Äôt know how to conjure feels that I just don‚Äôt have. I feel like I‚Äôm a slave to myself‚Ä¶",Bpd
