"After taking Zoloft for a week and experiencing a lot of manic symptoms, my psychiatrist deduced that I have bipolar disorder. This was after the fact that I told her about previous manic episodes and other information I provided for her, of course. Iâ€™ll be starting on seroquel 25 mg for 3 days, upping to 50 mg a night after that. My psych said that it is temporary and that I will switch to a different medication (or add a med but Iâ€™m not completely sure) soon after starting seroquel.

Itâ€™s just funny to me, because the only reason I sought out therapy and a psychiatrist was for an ADHD consultation. I was first medicated due to my extreme levels of depression and anxiety that Iâ€™ve been experiencing since I was 12/13 years old. Now it turns out that I have bipolar disorder.

Iâ€™m happy to be figuring myself out, but my god this is scarier than I thought. A lot of research ahead.",Bipolar
"I once read a poorly written article that mentioned bipolar people experience depression only as a result of the shame from their wild and manic behavior that they are embarrassed about.

"I am a 19M, it's actually my birthday tomorrow funnily enough...

I have gone my whole life dealing with every single symptom of BPD. It's become such a normal thing that I just never questioned it. Infact when I was younger I DID try telling my parents about it, but I was quickly dismissed for being ""dramatic"". Well the last few days I have been digging deeper into my emotions and tendencies, only to find every checkmark ticked. 

I'm not going to lie, I'm scared. What if I really am overreacting? I've told my best friend my suspicions and he has grown increasingly distant. I'm supposed to go in for a walk in appointment on Monday to be diagnosed I suppose, but I'm just really worried that I AM faking it.

Does anyone have any suggestions for me? This is my first time being open with this so I apologize if it's off-putting",Bipolar
"Not sure if this will be allowed by the sub rules. If you're in Sydney, I generally go fishing in a tinny on a Sunday morning (with an aim to be getting onto the water just before dawn). Until December I had a perfect record of zero fish caught since starting again in 2020.

Easily worked out from my post history but:

* I'm male, 50 years of age
* Have bipolar2, ADHD and PTSD induced chronic depression (all now medicated and ramping up to correct levels)

I'll provide the gear (including life jackets). I can even prepare some hookless rigs if you really would rather pretend than actually try catch fish. I prefer to feed them and mostly catch and release. I'm in the Hills district and put the boat in at Apple Tree bay. 

DM me if interested. This isn't an offer to take you fishing every weekend (its my recovery time) but I'd be happy to have some company some weekends.",Bipolar
"Iâ€™m so scared that this feeling will never go away and Iâ€™m scared that my current state of being is my new reality. Mania is scary but this little mix of ptsd and depression feels way worse. 
I keep having very vivid rape sleep paralysis nightmares and it has been keeping me bed ridden for the past 2-3 days. 
When I FaceTime friends itâ€™s like the feeling just goes away, but when Iâ€™m back in my head itâ€™s pounding and Iâ€™m kind of scared to fall back asleep. Idk what kind of help venting about this will get me but Iâ€™m just so scared.",Bipolar
"For contexts sake, I have Bipolar Disorder Type 1 and I gained roughly 80 pounds from Lithium Carbonate and other drugs over the past few years.

I was fine (or thought I was). Anyway, this is where I get stupid and why I am now crying and basically I hate myself (No surprise) Anyway called my hook up asked for cuddles and he said no because I was ""asking for too much"". 

Now I just hate myself and my brain for hurting and for not being normal and for being fat and for me working to loose the weight but only loosing 2.2 pounds this week whereas he's a body builder Marine who does porn on the side and has an open marriage.

"I got prescribed prozac for ""anxiety"" but it sent me into a super manic depressive state. So much so that I couldn't tell my dreams from reality and sort of attempted suicide but not really. I don't think I was actually gonna go through with it but I seriously had the urge to do so for the first time. My doctor said it's likely cuz I'm bipolar. But I've never had a episode of feeling elevated and like I could do anything. My mood mostly consists of feeling like shit to feeling sort of alright but still shitty. Are any of you guys like me? Oh and I was also smokin a lot of weed at the time. I'm putting the suicidal thoughts trigger cuz I don't wanna fuck someone up but this is really a general question. Thanks peeps.",Bipolar
"I'm almost 21 and have bipolar 1. In addition to medication, I use marijuana to manage my symptoms.

"Diagnosed bipolar earlier this year. Still figuring all this out butâ€¦.anxiety? Iâ€™ve always been an anxious person. However, I seem to be extra anxious lately. Nothing has really changed in my life except Iâ€™m working less because Iâ€™m afraid to go to work. 

I seem to be more anxious about work than Iâ€™ve ever been. I took two weeks off because Iâ€™m so anxious. Itâ€™s developing into a real fear to where my heart races just when I think about going to work the next week. Itâ€™s becomingâ€¦crippling. Im try my best to not smoke weed to chill or drink to numb. 

Every time I have a bad day at work it just makes me more afraid to go back. It just keeps building and building and it feels insurmountable. Iâ€™ve never had it this bad and I have no idea what to do. Unfortunately quitting this job is not possible for another 6 months. I wait tables and people are so mean and judgmentalâ€¦.theyâ€™re cruel, really. The job is constantly chaotic, disorienting, and extremely stressful. I just want to drink myself to death as soon as I get home. 

 What if I make a mistake again? 
What if someone gets mad at me?
What if my manager thinks my tip percentage is too low?
What if my manager thinks im the biggest idiot here and secretly hates my guts?
What if I am stupid? Everyone else can handle this..
What if they fire be because Iâ€™m so stupid?

"I was hospitalised in 2019 just after I turned 18 for an acute psychotic episode with mania and gradiouse beliefs. 

I was later diagnosed with depressive bipolar disorder and have been taking meds for nearly three years now. 

However, I have become very depressed recently. I have regular traumatic flashbacks and I am absolutely terrified of being noticed in public by people that might know who I am / what happened to me.

Anyone who has been hospitalised or has had psychosis can I have some reassurance that I'm not going mad?

"I just need to rant because my BPD2 is winning right now.

I've done everything I can think of except except Electro Convulsion Therapy.

* I've done intense seminars.
* I'm on an anti-depressant, and anti psychotic, and birth control to stop my period.
* I've traveled to the jungle and did a ceremony with a shahwoman.
* I've micro-dosed and have done spiritual healing trips.
* I've done ketamine under direction of a physician.
* I've tried Fisher's electro stimulation.
* I've used THC and CBD
* I've done acupuncture

I cannot do this any longer and I'm running our of energy to try. Last year, I had so many hypomanic and depressive episodes in a short span of time, its hard to count.  I'm losing my short-term memory for godsake.  I feel fucking crazy. What kind of life is this?

"Canâ€™t deal with anything right now, having such bad emotions and also feeling betrayed because my Dr let my prescription lapse before my appointment on Wednesday, I told her I had been without for two days, then find out yesterday that she didnâ€™t put in the refillâ€¦ only sheâ€™s gone for the weekend by that point.

"So I've been smoking a LOT of weed lately and at first it was to help me but now I think it's adding to my disorder (bipolar 1). It's expensive and not fun anymore but I can't seem to stop. I'll even be asking myself ""why"" as I'm packing a bowl.

My aunt offered for me to cat/house sit for two weeks in Montana (I'm from Arizona) and I agreed because why not? So I'm 3 days in now with no smoking and I feel good? I'm starting to dream again and feel super social.

THAT BEING SAID I am concerned it may be the start of a manic swing however, I've been severely depressed since June. Every day of the summer was a fight. Anyway, regardless of whether it's my mind clearing up or a manic episode in my future I feel very excited to feel again.

"So I'm 20 years old and was diagnosed when I was 15 and in the hospital. I have been on different medications since I was 13 for depression and anxiety. After I had a huge manic episode that definitely almost ruined my life (thank god I was still a minor and able to make it out of my mess with no big consequences, I was then diagnosed with bipolar 1 and put on lexipro and Latuda. It worked great for a long time. The biggest downside was feeling like an emotionless robot tbh. Things that should've made me sad, didn't affect me. I was never really happy or sad or angry, just here. Once I turned 18 I was kicked out and have been bouncing from place to place since then. Most of my jobs have been through temp services and don't offer medical insurance. I haven't been on any meds for about a year and a half now. I just can't afford it at all.

"I started off the year in a psychosis and really messed up. I spent a few days lost in my head and my delusions and literally spent the days driving around, being an idiot and speeding. I drove close to 1500 miles in 4 days. Well I managed to get caught by a cop and pulled over for speeding. I was also smoking a joint at the time and got hit with a DUI. Thankfully I keep my delusions in my head and don't talk about them so they didn't know I wasn't all there so I didn't get sent to the pysch ward. They just threw me in jail for a few days before I was able to pay the bail. Now I feel like my life is ruined. I never expected this to happen to me, I normally am a safe driver and don't speed. I also don't smoke either but during this episode I thought it was okay and wouldn't mess with my head for some reason.


I have been feeling like a complete failure since this happened and feel into a depressive pit. I'm also unemployed so now I have to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a lawyer, DUI courses, and my license is suspended. This is really going to make it so much more difficult to get a job than it already has been. I guess like a lot of us, I've had trouble keeping a job and have some gaps between employment but now this? I can't see myself ever getting a decent job again. I also told the only friend I have an tried to vent to him and guess what... he now avoids me. I just want to sleep for the rest of the year.",Bipolar

"It gets better, everyone.

For years I left my illness unmedicated. Destroyed relationships, phones, and of course, frying my brain like an egg with drugs and mania. Decided to get help after I destroyed the most valuable relationship in my life. A little too late.

Now I'm on meds and am generally doing better. After a whole year though I'm still making adjustments.

 I was so so so so excited to get my degree... It sent me into an episode, completely schizoaffective, but this time I was on the meds. Stabilized within a week (thank you Latuda and Abilify, sorry mom) and am feeling better again.

It's full of ups and downs but I wouldn't change who I am.

Im tired of the wait lists and now my psychiatrist screwed up their schedule so my appointment today got canceled and Iâ€™m looking at 20 days no meds if I donâ€™t do something.

I finally did it. I was taken by ambulance to the hospital in February last year for something I tried doing to myself. My dads insurance paid for only a tiny part of it.

"So from what I understand there are officially two diagnostic categories for bipolar disorder which are defined quite specifically.

However while trying to understand whether or not I might have bipolar disorder I have talked to a few friends diagnosed with bipolar and a few friends who have questioned whether they might be bipolar.

From what my friends have said it often seems like it's really common not to really fit neatly into the diagnostic criteria. For example I have two friends with type two bipolar disorder who have experienced a full blown manic episode under unusual circumstances. One of them often has hypomanic episodes that only last one day. There are also edge cases where people have some bipolar traits but not enough to meet the diagnostic criteria.

I'm normally depressed but under unusual circumstances I've had a couple of 2-3 day long hypomanic episodes. It's possible that I've had more but I don't remember very well. I had psychosis (or something close to it) once years ago but no mania. I have some 'risk factors' including ADHD and a bipolar family member. It's not quite enough to get a diagnosis but I feel like it's close. Sort of like I have potential for hypomania to become a cyclic thing but it hasn't so far.

I was kind of stressing about whether or not I have bipolar disorder until I learned that it seems like it's actually pretty common to be kind of an 'edge case' with apparently [40% of Americans with major depression having had a manic or hypomanic episode](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=118977). There's also cyclothymia, [depressive episodes with short duration hypomania](https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/depressive-episodes-with-short--duration-hypomania-dsm--5), and apparently various other subtypes of bipolar.

It also seems like there may be hereditary connections between major depression, bipolar, and psychosis/schizophrenia?

I was reminded of the autistic spectrum (i.e. the range of different ways autism can manifest). Previously in the DSM autism had a few different subtypes such as Asperger's syndrome and PDD-NOS but under further study they were considered to be quite difficult to distinguish from one another and had so much overlap that they were collated into a single diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder.

I'm wondering if the concept of ""spectrum"" could be similarly applied to bipolar disorder and its related conditions. What do you think?",Bipolar
"I would probably be a lot better off if I had a ""conservatorship"" in my 20s but at least I understand my illness now and I know what the rules are of staying well with bipolar (and how the illness can burn you badly if you're not following the rules).

"Hello all,

I have been in love with my friend for a while ago, about a year now, I think. We have known each other for five years and I honestly never thought he would be the one but I started to think about him all the time, and we would talk on the phone every night. A few months ago I really accepted that I love him and I want to be with him. I talked about him all the time to everyone, I wrote so many words in my diary about him and how much I love everything about him. I was thinking about him all the time and wanted to talk with him all the time. I secretly fantasized about being in a relationship with him, getting to call him my boyfriend and for him to call me his girlfriend, and doing domestic things together all the time. I did things like keep the spare pillow he used on my bed, and kept his phone charger on my wall from the time he stayed over, pretending that they were there because we were together and he lived with me. I wanted to always dress up nicely for him and shower him with gifts. I really felt feelings for him. 

One week ago I asked him to be my boyfriend. He said yes and he said he has actually liked me for a long time, since we first met. The problem is that since that day I have been feeling completely numb inside. I feel barely any love or happiness. It started when I woke up that morning. I had planned to give him flowers, I knew I should be feeling excited but I didn't feel much. I felt so worried that whole day because I didn't feel happy, but I didn't feel sad, I just felt no emotions. I started crying after the first time we kissed each other. I thought it would go away after a few days but it hasn't. I've felt nothing except numbness or anger (not related to him). I don't feel like myself at all. I feel like an alien or robot. Like I'm not even human anymore. I feel like I'm an intruder who got swapped with the ""real"" me and I have to just remember and recite what she likes, or what she would say. 

Has anyone else had an experience like this where you just suddenly shut off from your feelings? Am I just getting used to things? Am I maybe feeling shocked because of this big change in my life? Am I just having an episode? Is it my medications? I can't stop thinking about it. I'm so scared that I don't actually love him or something. I'm so scared because he loved me all this time, I finally tell him yes, I don't want to have to tell him that  it's actually a no. I couldn't live with myself. And I want to love him so bad. I just want my feelings to come back. I'm so afraid. Someone please help me.",Bipolar

"So here it goes. I am 23 years old, and I have no friends.

I just started seeing a therapist 2 weeks ago. I got a new job, and I just started going back to college and I have 5 semesters left. 

I have no one to talk to except my father, mother, and two younger brothers who are 19 and 17. 

I recently noticed everyone getting annoyed by me because I talk too much and always want to share what Iâ€™m interested in. 

I even ask about them like their day, or what theyâ€™re interested in, or just try to talk about them since I have no one to talk to and they donâ€™t care. 

So today I finally snapped. No one wanted to answer my calls, no one wanted to respond to my text, and no one wanted to even just sit in the living room and watch tv with me. I even said Iâ€™ll watch what they want to watchâ€¦

So I just sent them a text and said â€œIâ€™m tired of me always hitting you guys up and none of you ever responding or even messaging me firstâ€.

So starting today Iâ€™m gonna leave them alone and stop texting or calling them. 

If they donâ€™t care, I donâ€™t care.

I have been planning my Death day for my birthday for the past few years and this month I have chosen not to go through with it.

I know I'm never enough for anyone, any job, anything and I just feel guilty for taking up more space. 

Living is painful but hopefully... hopefully I'll find something worth living for. Something that reminds me that living is beneficial and that I'm worth it.

"If itâ€™s not too much, I would like to hear if anyone has no elevated/positive moods but bouts of severe anxiety, panic and the like. As I saud, my doc mentioned I may be bipolar but he is not sure and neither am I. So I thought I could ask here how and if people experience anything similar. And if they are diagnosed as bipolar.

To put this into context, I have mild to moderate depression always and episodes of severe, debilitating anxiety with panic attacks. This state will sometimes stay 24/7 for a few days or weeks and then change to â€žsome hours normal if I manage to distract myself and some still very badâ€œ.

Around two months or so ago I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 and my GP put me on Seroquel with the intention of gradually reducing the Resperidone. 
I then had a manic episode and my GP put me on 500mg of lithium with bloods being at 0.38 after two weeks. 
Heâ€™s now upped my dose to 750mg.
I just saw a psychiatrist this morning and he has suggested that once my blood is in therapeutic range, to gradually come off Seroquel &amp; Resperidone. 
On one hand Iâ€™m excited to come off the antipsychotics as I feel they dull my creativity and ability to think clearly.

I was just listening to a song today and thinking about our pregame at her apartment and listening to it while someone drove us to a party. it was the first time i really lived and did something crazy in college. she helped me live. we laughed so hard about the past and planned for craziness in the future. her life was very messy. she was a day drinker and alcoholic and ran with messy people, but it never crossed my mind that something like a car accident that wasn't her fault would kill her so soon. I'm not ready for the funeral if there is one. I'm not ready for school or work. I'm not ready to put this into prospective and maybe that's why I can't.

I don't know how to put into words what our friendship was, but it doesn't matter much now I don't think.",Bipolar

"I only got my diagnosis earlier this year and it took a few months of titration with meds before I really felt balanced.

I never researched too much about bipolar (pre diagnosis) because I didnâ€™t want to fall down the rabbit hole of self diagnosis, so the last few months has been a wealth of new discovery for me (esp via this sub when someone will post about a certain aspect and I can deeply relate to it).

I also tend to make self deprecating jokes, which my whole family does as well. I hear itâ€™s an Aussie thing. 

Anyway long story long, my partner and daughter have taken to rolling their eyes in a â€here we go againâ€œ manner if I mention bipolar.

"Ive always thought i had bipolar, but everyone Ive brought it up to says its normal to have mood swings/not be happy all the time but it feels like more than that.

Most of the time Im just depressed but i remember having manic episodes more when i was in middle and high school, my parents would scold me (for being too wild)and ask if i was on drugs. I would pull all-nighters, i bought several pets i had no business owning, i would drive crazy, go on 10 mile runs, cut my own hair in the middle of the night, get into physical fights, and then crash and regret everything. Ive also lost many friends by starting fights or ignoring out of depression and ive struggled with SH since 7th grade. 

Im now 25 and just got off of Lexapro because it caused a manic episode, i asked my physiatrist about mood stabilizers but she said shes â€œnot convincedâ€ i need them and prescribed me anxiety meds that arent helping at all. And now im sad and confused. 

So i guess im askingâ€¦am i being dramatic by thinking i might have bipolar? I feel almost embarrassed to bring it up with my doctor again because theyâ€™ll probably say its normal or not enough evidence.

"Hi,

I also am an aspie, so please don't think I'm being obtuse in understanding this social situation!

Basically, became massively infatuated with someone, which triggered both a mixed episode and my psych deciding to concurrently diagnose me with BPD. (He knows I have bipolar as he witnessed the mixed episode and knows about an OD I took lately. )

I asked him why he'd been so distanced, and he said something about us being in different places, and, when pressed, that, since he heard I had feelings for him and am a colleague in a vulnerable position, he'd taken a step back.

I understand he is not interested in me romantically. But does his response mean there is zero attraction? A part of me hopes he doesn't think I'm disgustingly ugly, but believes it's inappropriate for the reasons he mentioned. I understand you're not mind readers, but I can't ask him for clarification, so was please hoping for some answers?

Thank you!",Bipolar

"**Background**: Eight months ago, I was involuntarily hospitalized with grandiose manic delusions. I thought I was both Jesus and Batman, and wanted to marry my car. 

Despite no desire to self-harm or intention to harm others, the way I was driving was enough to declare me a danger...

So I joined the grippy sock club and was discharged with a script for 1200mg Lithium. 

I'm stable now. But stable is a misleading word. There's so many things I wish I could do but find myself unable to start. I *hate* that people like us are overrepresented in jails, in drug rehab, and where even *stable* means being loaded up on expensive meds.


**Today**:
I want my first episode to be my only. But for this to happen for me, I need to understand *how* I became deluded. And to that end, 
I've reactivated my 3 old Twitter handles from the depths of my psychosis, and what I will say is they are uneasy friends at best. 

While I, and I need to *emphasize* now, I am medicated and stable, with a psychiatrist and therapist and strong friends and family to fall back on... I have already been able to produce psychotic features of my own volition. I'm learning to understand the same experiences as symptoms instead of external ""signs"" that drove my delusions. 


I'm excited to do this self-exploration and to be documenting it all to the best of my ability online. 

If any of this is of interest to you, you can certainly follow along. You'd probably want to start with [The Austonian](https://twitter.com/AustonianC),  they're the most meta of the bunch, and they do still contain my old scribblings as a bonus, if you scroll far enough.

I told him about an ideation i was having of hurting someone else. He tried to say "" you dont wanna think like that, is this person that bad? Im sure they're an ok person""

What? That's why I'm here today, because i dont want to get in trouble, or make another manic decision that i need to pick the pieces up afterwards.

So what did i do? I punched the handsanitizer thing, broke it. I feel horrible. I just stormed out of the hospital, and tried to chill. But i couldn't. So i went home.

It's not other people's responsibility to make sure im acting in healthy ways. This is not me, and when im manic, im easily triggered. I feel bad. This is my illness, and i hate that it effects others so much. I feel really trapped.

"I guess I'm seeking advice or would like to hear what has worked for people regarding this. As someone with bipolar I have a unique dependency with aspects of my routine and oftentimes an extreme sensitivity to stress. After years of stability, honestly, I am entirely convinced that it is 100% impossible for ""normal"" people to wrap their head around this. There is often a certain rigidity that I need to hold over certain things such as meals, meditation practice, down time, time to get things done, lights out time... and to someone without bipolar disorder that tends to sound absolutely preposterous.

With my family I can just walk away, seek my own space, and do my own thing. But with a significant other there is an aspect of emotion and sharing of space that is not a part of all my other relationships. There is pressure to meet certain emotional needs and this pressure to just ""loosen up a little bit"" at times. Like I don't have enough of a hard time already! I often WANT to abandon my routine and do whatever I want whenever I want; I want to blow things off and procrastinate and cast aspects of routine aside for that sake. It's hard to be healthy.

My significant other is wonderful and we have a very healthy relationship, but of course there are times that she doesn't realize how much of a ""distraction"" she can be or when there is that pressure to cater to emotion. When I communicate that, of course there are times that she may take it personally. Sometimes she is unaware when she pushes me to loosen up a bit, and sometimes I do. That's on me, not on her. Of course that comes with consequences, and when she sees that she recognizes it and learns how to support and meet my needs better in that regard.

Overall, she is a very receptive and wonderful partner. I couldn't ask for anything more from her. She does her part and is always striving for growth in playing that role just a little bit better. I commit to doing the same on my end. We strive for that together, and I take pride in that.

Recently Iâ€™ve been off meds 1 monthish and I feel my health is deteriorating. I am always sleepy with no energy. I can't wake up and I'm getting dizzy most of the time. I cannot work at all due to the low energy and sleepiness. I haven't showered in days. I know these signs are leading to depression. How do I cope with this. I gained 20kg due to this and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm the only one who makes money for my family, I have my own freelance business (design field) but I can't seem to have any energy to do any type of physical activity. It's been like this since the beginning of the year and I just think it's getting worse. 
What do I do? I'm confused. I need to fix this soon as I'll be moving countries soon and I want to be able to take care of myself.",Bipolar
"Hi, just have a couple of questions to help me understand bipolar better.

Is (hypo)mania:

1. triggered by an event (e.g. a trauma trigger) or does it just come out of the blue?

2. while I understand hypomania needs to last four days or more for diagnosis purposes, can someone with bipolar have shorter periods of hypomania such as just one or two days?",Bipolar
"Iâ€™ve  recently been diagnosed with bipolar, but I started seeing my psychiatrist in March. Iâ€™m currently in a manic episode which is the first sheâ€™s seen. She upped my Lithium to 1200 and my Olanzapine to 5mg but Iâ€™m stillon 20mg fluoxetine.

Im feeling an ultimate high, depression and anxiety at the same time. 

At this time my rational side is holding back my impulsivity and god complex. Iâ€™m one bad day away from quitting my job and starting an onlyfans and streaming. 

Why? I donâ€™t know!! I got god complex in my head right now telling me itâ€™ll work out and just do it. But I know itâ€™s just me trying to find an escape from the mundaness of life. But manic part of me is like â€œcome oooon ðŸ˜ letâ€™s do itâ€

Iâ€™m throwing all my energy into exercising. Itâ€™s tough in my head right now lol I also put myself on a payment plan for a vacation I canâ€™t afford ðŸ¤ ðŸ™ƒ

Sheâ€™s adjusting my meds at this time.",Bipolar
"I've tried three different anti psychotics now and none of them have changed my emotional numbness/brain dead feeling.Currently not taking anything but have now been prescribed lamotrigine and seroquel. I had one manic episode in February in my 35 years of life because of Zoloft and now Im on this never ending quest to feel ""better"" but I literally do not know how I'm supposed to feel. I see people post about being stable but without having a history of mania I can't confirm what stability I'm looking for. I don't feel unstable off medication I just feel anxious. I'm not opposed to meds but I just feel like I need a break. I'm feeling like a Guinea pig these days :(",Bipolar
"Hi friends â€” I recently restarted Effexor (150mg) and Lamictal (150mg) and have noticed since hitting full dosage with both that my ability to remember my dreams has all but disappeared

Before abruptly stopping both of them I was taking Lamictal for a year and Effexor for 4 yearsâ€¦ I notice the contrast in how vivid and memorable my dreams were without the medication compared to the mostly blank slate I experience now. 

Has anyone found either of these medications make dreaming disappear or lessen for you?",Bipolar
I made a mess again.,Bipolar
"I don't want to go through it again. But I do. Things go flat and for too long. Each day is the same. There are good things that happen most every one but it's still the same day over and over. Wake up and take a quick assesment.....nope not feeling any bit the other direction so be satisfied with that. Prop up and watch the sky get brighter soon it will be completely light out and you'll have to head back into the same day. Try to imagine a life that could be different, to where you don't recognize the redundancy. Pretty sure I always will. Robotic thing. 

For a while it was very real and I thought He would help. Plenty of doubts along the way, having not believed all those years before, but you believed He might help. Not so sure anymore, about any of this. It's faded away so much, that the Creator is the One. I Am Who I Am, so am I, and who I am is just another robot in a redundant life. Was hoping You could help with that. But I'm not so sure anymore. 

I want it to come back, now two things. That strong belief plus those days where I was a part of life. More than a part, set apart. Each day was different and certainly not redundant, but the last time it happened it was the best so far. Is my mind matured to handle the ride now? The last time was so very different. Some moments of grandeur but...just part of something bigger as the redundant pattern that everyone else was in was set apart from me. Crisp, but not chaotic. 

But it never lasts. Back to reality. Back to the pattern. Robotic existence and now He's becoming not-so-real. It's been two summers since my last ride. Wouldn't mind if it came back but I can't say what it will be like. Wasn't working those two summers ago so I could fold into whatever I wanted to. If it came back now I'd probably quit and think everything would work out. Usually doesn't. Been a year and a half since He became real, now that's fading away. Back to just being alive. 

Life could be much worse and I know this. It's been 15 years since my first ride. The next four were pretty crazy, most recent was the best, two summers ago. A dark winter of sorts followed. Not depressed, just lost. Existential stuff, dark night of the soul. Then He showed up in my bedroom one night. A sensation, presence, like I've never experienced before. And haven't since. Been a year and a half since that night and a lot of diving in. But it's faded away and I'm back to watching the sky get bright. Not sure what's real except that the bills need paid that way I can wake up to the same day over and over. Not thinking it will ever be any different at this point. Just here.",Bipolar
Took first dose of lithium last night (300mg) and today iâ€™m supposed to up it to 600mg but the first night was absolute hell. I took it in the evening time and was fuckin around doing bullshit until i was ready for bed and took my quetiapine (800mg) when all of a sudden I have the most intense stomach pains and cramps iâ€™ve ever fucking felt. Lasted for about maybe an hour with multiple unsuccessful trips to try and shit when eventually god blessed me with the most nasty diarrhea shit iâ€™ve ever had. When does this stop?,Bipolar
"Well that was pretty stupid. Or was it? 

Close call, in a way, not in an arrogant way in saying that, or my beliefs are correct and you're wrong, but my journey into belief almost came to a complete stop. Came at the hands of spending time on one of those Christian subreddit things. Open discussion for all things Christianity related so athiests and agnostics and theists and Satanists and seventh day Adventists and Jehovahs witnesses and....anyone was welcome to post something or comment. Wasn't very civil at times either. A lot of the time. 

I guess it was bound to happen, come across information that denounces Christ and the existence of God. Obviously not something that I'm unaware of, people don't believe Jesus is who he said he was and God doesn't exist. But spending about a month and a half in that community was pretty much like snorting a line of doubt and questioning straight to my brain. No slow trickle of doubts and questioning, not a little jab here and there, just a flood of second guessing. God certainly started fading away in my mind, Christ as well, the night that brought me into belief and the strange things that have happened also quickly became nothing. Pretty stupid to do that to myself not sure why I'm such an idiot sometimes but it was bound to happen - extreme doubt. 

It had to be exponentially easier to step into the path of becoming a believer when the internet wasn't avaliable. Build your faith without a whole lot of conflicting information around. I'm actually 100% certain of that, was easier. I could've just not done that but being the Curious George that I am, went right into the lions den ""Oh Geroge, you so silly. Why did you snort that line of doubt and questioning?"" I dunno. Seemed like the intelligent thing to do. But perhaps the hardest stuff to read was from the ex-Christians. Decades of involvement within the church. If anyone would know that Christianity is a bunch of nonesense it would be those folks. Yea that sucked. Spending time in that place. That online community. 

One of the other discouraging posts I came across was that you can only hear God speak through scriptures. I'm not wanting to ever hear a voice in my head, ever, been through enough inside that place. Nice. Let's add this to my resume - I'm hearing voices inside my head. Noooo thank you. But people claim to have heard God speak to them. Some people hear God speak in other ways. And then yea others say that God only speaks through scriptures. I don't like that opinion, God only speaks through the Bible, mostly because of how I came into initial belief and also that I'm still having a hard time with the Bible. It doesn't seem like God is speaking to me, the words still seem as if man wrote them and are were not written by God, inspired writings. 

The author C.S. Lewis was quoted as saying something along the lines of how he was dragged kicking and screaming into the Kingdom of God. And it came to be that he didn't want to believe, but found himself later that he did. Pretty much where I'm at. If I come to fully believe that Jesus was the Son of God it won't be from brainwashing. I'm fighting this tooth and nail. 

A very high percentage of this adventure hasn't been fun. I'm envious of people who came to belief and pretty much overnight thier lives were enriched. Hasn't been the case for me. But I guess everyone's brain and walk is different and perhaps there's a reason everything has played out this way. Almost Curious George'd my way out of belief. Fun times.",Bipolar
"Last week i slept some days only 5 hours, then some days 10 to 11 hours, monday to wednesday under 4hours and last night 7hours. I'm in a clinic on seroquel again and some other shit like temesta when in need. But i don't sleep i rave in my bed. Lots of thoughts racing in my head, and some intrusive thoughts since 5 days. My feeling of time is totally gone, absolute sensory overload when i'm outside. Currently dunno what to do. Too paranoid for meeting my fellow patients. Somebody wanna talk? Or just tell me your hypomania stories please. Need a little bit fun here.",Bipolar

"Saw my [regular] doctor today and was advised to start regularly taking an over-the-counter allergy med such as Claritin or Zyrtec. Everything I already take is in my file (accurately, too, as the nurse who did my vitals updated them for me), so I'm assuming they wouldn't have recommended I take something that would negatively interact with my psych meds. Didn't occur to me to ask before I left, and I tried to search on my own, but couldn't come up with definitive answers.

I sent a message to my psychiatrist asking about possible interactions, but I'm not sure when I'll hear back from them &amp; I'd like to pick up meds as soon as possible because the allergies are, quite frankly, making me fucking miserable/affecting my ability to function.

Just wondering if any one here has experience regularly taking an OTC allergy med along with either of these psych meds??? thanks in advance!!!

â€¢ Lithium (seems like there shouldn't be an interaction)
â€¢ Lamotrigine (couldn't find anything definite)
â€¢ Latuda (couldn't find anything definitive)",Bipolar
"How do you feel when someone (who isn't bipolar) you know says they're so manic in the fashion of something akin to ""omg I'm so manic I just bought so much makeup lol"" or the like?",Bipolar
"I don't know what's happening really. But does anyone have  mental confusion?  Like I have ocd too so I don't know if it's this... But like for exemple I am sure of one thing in my life like for exemple 2+2=4 and all my life i believed in that but then from time to time it's like a switch happen and I begin to question that even tought I know it's not like that.

This happened with me a while ago,  I knew that it wasent like that but my mind was telling me otherwise constantly and then I began to not discern of my toughts where the voice of God or of the devil... (it was something religious related)

And then there's the other thing I just seem to be interested in people if I :
Have that rush of interest over them initially
Or I only have a zest for life if I have a interest wich I spend hours on... I usually try not to have one because it takes over my time but it's like my mind needs one and tries to focus on everything to obssess over it...",Bipolar

"Thatâ€™s literally it. what else do u fuckin need to read??? I want to be calm but I can feel the undertone of me feeling wired and unmedicated so Iâ€™m certain itâ€™s gunna come out and cause shit but Iâ€™m READY for it.

People are disappointing, including myself at times. I disappoint myself not doing what I should and then relying on other people but then I get let down. Why did I even allow my brain to expect anything from them?",Bipolar
