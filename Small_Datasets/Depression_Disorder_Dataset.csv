"Like they aren't actually there. But i hear them like they are real. Its not always just sometimes. Its like a hallucination but maybe others have that too.

Also I see my dream stuff vividly as soon as i close my eyes. Its creepy how vibid my dreams are and everything.",Depression
"It happened on Saturday, and to be honest I didnâ€™t like the kid a lot. But he was sometimes nice to me. I almost killed myself when I was 12 but survived. I just wish he did too. I havenâ€™t even seen him in 7 years but I feel awful. I was told I have survivors guilt but I donâ€™t know what that means. I donâ€™t understand why I feel almost guilty in some way",Depression
"Its weird that of all places, I chose reddit. I won't lie to you, I only came here to share my thoughts; I didn't even know this subreddit existed until a couple of seconds ago. Anyways, I do not consider myself depressed. But I every so often get a series of mental breakdowns and thoughts of hoping I die early. It didn't seem like an issue until it started coming more and more frequently. But I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't feel like my problems are big enough for my family to care about, like they are insignificant. Its just stuff like my grades and losing small things but it brings me a lot of anxiety and stress. I can't explain it to anyone. Plus, I don't want to seem like I need help mentally. I want to make sure my family sees me as happy and enjoying my time. Especially since I moved away from them. I also can't talk to my friends because they are new and don't ever take me seriously. Its even become a joke where I would say ""I just want to kill myself at this point"" and my friend would say ""Save it for the GCSEs"" because if someone dies during the exams everyone gets an A. I want to get a therapist, but I am living with someone who is tied to my family closely, so I don't want them to think I'm unhappy. What should I do? Someone please, help me.",Depression
"I feel like a robot I wake up eat cook and clean take of my daughter and nothing else. I have no real friends no life no nothing Iâ€™ve tried talking to my family but no one really truly gets it ( my family is Christian so all they say is pray) they donâ€™t understand how deeply Iâ€™m hurting. Im sorry If this is all over the place itâ€™s hard trying to get all my feeling out, donâ€™t know how to put it into words. I also feel like a slave in my own home I do all of the house work no one every really helps all they do is make messes theyâ€™re all lazy. Usually I have a better grip over my emotions but lately itâ€™s gotten pretty bad. Iâ€™ve been crying like everyday havenâ€™t really been sleeping, donâ€™t have the desire to eat much either Iâ€™m pretty much forcing it. Iâ€™ve always had bad anxiety but Due to Trauma itâ€™s gotten worse Iâ€™m scared to leave my house it takes so much effort to just go to the doctor, store take my daughter to the park etc. she never gets to go anywhere or do anything and I hate myself because if it. I told my parents before that I wanted to give her away not too long after she was born I explained to them what I was feeling and they were no help. donâ€™t get me wrong I love her I just donâ€™t think Iâ€™m what she needs. I feel like Iâ€™m about to burst I visualize and fantasize about stabbing myself and sitting my wrists  almost everyday. feel like I have to reason to go on I never finished high school, donâ€™t really have much going for myself, I lack motivation, and I feel an extreme Detachment from people and reality. I donâ€™t really have a lot of ppl that would miss me and my daughter is young enough that she has time to forget me Iâ€™m tired of reaching out for help screaming for someone to see me and the pain that Iâ€™m in Iâ€™m over it. No one can say I didnâ€™t ask for help I love my family but there is nothing here worth living for in my eye and I didnâ€™t plan on living long anyway",Depression
"I have been doing weekly therapy for about 3 months and I am not improving.  I have textbook depression symptoms primarily precipitated by my current financial problems, an abusive wife and a debilitating injury.  I am completely isolating myself, not exercising, unable to perform simple and routine tasks and unable to enjoy anything. It's affecting my work and my attention to my children (two fifteen year olds).  

Being a health care professional, I have reservations about starting on an antidepressant.  I don't want to become dependent and I've hear that it is hard to taper off them.  But my current state is impacting everything and I am worried that it is affecting my kids.  My therapist also thinks it's time to start but respects my hesitation.

Appreciate any thoughts about my dilemma.",Depression
"context: (~24(M) INTP-T with severe GAD and depression, OCD, antisocial, very jealous/clingy type, doesnt have many friends, doesnt talk to friends much)

My on-and off long distance relationship of 5 years has ended about 5-6 months ago. We seemed to have had a misunderstanding of what our expectations were in the relationship, and she broke up with me and told me that I will never find somebody that fits what I am looking for. And I agree. I have been in grief since then, and to my despair, have been dreaming of her quite often since then. Most of my dreams are of me getting the cold shoulder from her, or getting to pet my dog who has died a few years ago around her birthday. She has rabbits. It hurts me to see rabbits. Halo Infinite came out around the perfect time for me to fixate on it, as a way of coping, or else I don't know how much worse I would feel, but I'm at my new rock bottom in many ways, especially considering I do not have a job, I failed at getting my best chance for a good job, and I rarely ever have the confidence or drive to push through the immense anxiety that comes with something like that. I feel as if, if I were not a man, I would be able to find a relationship easier. 

She set up a condescending dating profile for me over a year ago when we had an argument. I 'fixed' that profile shortly after I got confirmation that she broke up with me 5-6 months ago, and found her profile in a few weeks since we were a ""98% match,"" and discovered that she had already found someone, and I'm happy for her, but it did hit me hard and made me realize I was still in the denial stage of grief. I had finally gotten a tablet and downloaded a game that she had wanted to play with me, and I wanted to tell her, but when I saw that, I realized the futility. I feel the same way I would feel of I had lost a family member who was suffering. A small percentage bittersweet, but mostly I feel deathly.

I have had some mutual interests with women on the dating site, but I know for certain that I am not in the position I my life that I'd need to be in to be worthy of a woman like that accepting a relationship with me, and I'd probably become jealous anyways. I can easily get panic attacks from jealousy, and prefer to date someone like me who doesn't really have friends, but that is really difficult for me to accomplish, and was the final straw in my last relationship. I understand that I am the problem. I don't believe I can change this type of thing, and medicine only does so little. My hair has also been thinning for years, and since the breakup has gotten out of control. My hair used to be the thing that gave me the majority of my physical confidence. I feel doomed, and every day feels like I wake up and think that I am in some type of cushiony hell. My heart weighs deep, and the best way I can describe it is a black hole. Dense, heavy, devoid of light, and the memories of her are being spaghettified at the event horizon. At least I'm not at my wits' end, since I still have my wit and dark humor. But with essentially no one to share it with. As an INTP, I am an extreme example. I spend my life brainstorming worlds in my imagination and taking notes, instead of worrying about reality as much as I should, but the pain always follows. I have failed. I have failed. I am not desperate, but I feel the despair. I have to stay true to myself, if I am to simply be. Time doesn't heal me. I have learned this over many years. I have been cheated on by other exes and ghosted. Romantic love is such a major aspect of me as a person, and I implode in its absence. I woke up today and felt compelled to write all of this. I fear this, and everything to come and for things to never begin.",Depression

"I had a rough up bringing most of my mothers exs beat me and a neighbor molested  me when I was young I told my mother who didn't believe me as I grew up I was bullied a lot due to walking with a slight limp when I about 12 my mom finally met someone who was nice and I had a closer bond with him then I did with my mom but unfortunately he passed away from cancer in 2017 I hate to say it but part of me wishes I'd lost my mom instead of my step dad as I could never trust my mom with anything she knows what I've been through and just says man up and deal with it but the older I get the more it seems to affect me since my step dad has passed I find myself either waking up on edge or having to drink my self to sleep else I relive his last moments as was with him when he passed  . When my step dad was told he had 6 months left I was with him but mom was at home  when she found out she went to her parents for 3 months I chose to give up work to care /dress/bath/hook up to feeding tube and give pain meds to my step dad and when my mom finally came back she acted like she had done every thing and tried to make me leave even when he died with in 5 mins of him being pronounced dead she packed up all his stuff and walked out and she mad at me because I cant forgive her actions sorry that this post is all over the place it's my first time posting on redit and my head is all over the place I just dont know what to do should i cut my mom out my life ,?",Depression
"Im generally unhappy with my life and its something i sometimes just shove aside as is what it is but othertimes like now it really just eats away at me. 

Ive dealt with trauma from family growing up which has severly damaged my self esteem and my self worth. I constantly overthink everything i do, feel like every person has it out for me, and feel like no matter how hard an effort i put out its still just eh for everyone. To put it bluntly im a male whos had issues with his father growing up. Verbal and physical abuse which has caused trauma to my mental state. 

I feel like im just stuck in going through the motions of this, and it sucks because i can tell my mood does affect those around me. (I do have a fiance who usually can tell when something is off, i have talked with her about all this and shes been understanding and wanted to help but my mind constantly goes back to this exact state) i never mean to have my issues impact others and it just makes me feel worse about it when i do have outbursts/down moods. 

I do sometimes have thoughts of life and everyone would be better if i didnt exist (not wanting to take my life i know thats not the answer to any issue) but i really have feelings that i wish i wasnt born. 

Im just sick of dealing with this and dont know what to do anymore.",Depression
"My 32yo sister is severely depressed and has been for over a year. Sheâ€™s had mental health issues for many years but over the past year itâ€™s become much worse.

She hasnâ€™t worked for over a year and is supporting herself by borrowing money from family and friends, but mainly our parents. She lives with roommates in an expensive city. She is drinking and smoking weed daily, and spends a lot of time watching TV in bed and ordering Uber eats. She has a reasonably good support network in terms of family and friends but nothing seems to help and nobody knows how to help her. 

She has been seeing a therapist for many years, the same person. She is medicated but clearly the current medication isnâ€™t enough. Her doctor wanted to switch to a new medication but she is worried about stopping her current one so hasnâ€™t switched. 

Whenever we ask her about looking for a job she just says something like â€œitâ€™s really rough out thereâ€ or â€œdoesnâ€™t seem like thereâ€™s much aroundâ€, and even when weâ€™ve found good jobs open that meet her interests, she doesnâ€™t have the confidence to apply and does not submit applications. 

Itâ€™s painful to see her like this and we think she needs more help, but what? People in this community that have come out the other side, what was helpful?

Thereâ€™s also the secondary issue of money - as a family we keep giving her money but itâ€™s expensive given her lifestyle (expensive rent, lots of Uber eats and alcohol/weed). However our parents live in other cities and we also have concerns about forcing her to move cities to move back in with our parents. We donâ€™t have anywhere in her current city that she could live rent free.

As a family we can afford to support her for a while or pay for whatever help she needs but continuing to just give her money when she isnâ€™t seeking more help or moving forward doesnâ€™t seem like itâ€™s getting us anywhere. Weâ€™re not sure whether continuing to just hand over money is helping or hindering. Does anyone have advice on this point?

Thank you in advance for any advice this community can provide, weâ€™re simply stuck and not sure how to help.",Depression
"I was called ugly all my life, been made fun of in middle school, my friends called me ugly on a daily basis. 

I finally started to feel a little better because since I started highschool people started complimenting me more I was actually hit on by both man and women. I made out with 3 people and kissed 2 other. Yesterday I made out with a random girl in the middle of the street that called me beautiful and now she is flirting with me, my friend that has a crush on me curently kissed me on the lips, my beautiful crush also liked me physically (didn't work out though). Also an ex crush offered to get me off in the school bathroom. And my self esteem was kinda high so I wanted people to rate me and they all rated me 5.5, 6 and 6.5 ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ And also said I look quirky??

"Iâ€™ve struggled with depression for over a decade now, but lately itâ€™s been more severe than itâ€™s ever been. I finally just now broke down crying and spilled my soul to my husband, telling him how hopeless and tired and done Iâ€™m feeling. I never have the time to do anything I enjoy, Iâ€™m in an abusive workplace but I canâ€™t quit because I have massive debt and bills and responsibilities that are crushing me, I never have the energy to take care of the house and that makes me even more depressed because of the guilt I feel knowing he picks up the slack when I canâ€™t function. I just sobbed and spilled my guts and expressed how hopeless and useless and stuck I feel and heâ€¦didnâ€™t say anything. He just sat there and didnâ€™t say a thing. And itâ€™s not like heâ€™s never seen this side of me, like I said Iâ€™ve struggled with depression for over a decade so for as long as heâ€™s known me he has known my depression. But he didnâ€™t say a thing. No words of comfort, no promises that he will help me, nothing. Now I donâ€™t know who to turn to. I thought he of all people would be there for me and help me but he didnâ€™t say anything. So I asked him to please leave me alone and he justâ€¦left.

"Hello Friends of Reddit :) I am looking for opinions and advice from people who have experienced depression. 

I(30f) recently met and started dating a lovely guy (25). We work at a remote hotel and live in a small community. We met while out drinking with a few people. He flirted with me heavily at first, but I brushed it off. Then we met again within a group at a super bowl party. We stuck together all night talking and laughing, I was very charmed by his warm and open energy. From there we went on a couple official dates and itâ€™s been so easy but also exciting. Iâ€™m falling for him 100% and it feels mutual. 

Now, a couple weeks into seeing each other which is also about 2 weeks ago now, he starts opening up about how much he doesnâ€™t like his job. He says he puts on a fake face at work and has to drink a ton of coffee to keep it up. I can relate that itâ€™s a stressful job as I do it too (serving). He also tells me he hates feeling trapped in this small community, especially as itâ€™s winter and will still be a couple months till it warms up where we are (north eastern Canada). These comments snowballed untill I could see that he was depressed. He made the great choice to stop drinking untill he feels better, which I fully support. He is withdrawing socially. He told me about a week ago that normally when he feels â€œlike thisâ€, he would push me away, but isnâ€™t going to because he really likes me. I found this to be great communication and I want to trust that itâ€™s true. However, we went from spending most nights together to just going 3 in a row where he wanted to sleep alone. Thankfully through this weâ€™ve been getting out for drives, he keeps up with errands ect so it hasnâ€™t all be holing up in his room. But 3 days in a row needing space has me concerned, even though I want to be understanding and trustful. 

I have dated a man with severe depression before, and I learned a lot. Iâ€™ve always known if I had another shot at love with someone similar I would â€œdo it betterâ€. I want to give space while keeping the connection. 

Iâ€™d love to hear any similar stories or advice :) thank you for your time !! ðŸ’•ðŸ’•",Depression

"I'm just hating on myself.  I'm so tired of being depressed.  And to make things worse my brother is going to leave the house.  Due to family issues we both live with my dad even as adults.  My brother does the majority of the work around the house and helps me a lot when I need it.  (I have physical problems which make doing certain things hard or impossible)  I have always hated being a burden to him, to make things worse I'm waiting for disability or ssi.  I've tried to find some ways to earn money online so I could at least pay rent and give my brother some money for all he does, but haven't been successful.   

I've helped him out with other things when we were younger but now he doesn't need me for anything.  Now knowing he is leaving my depression is worsening as my anxiety is trying to skyrocket.  My mind is just in a mess.  Worried about where he is going, if he will be okay, what I'm I going to due without his help?  Mostly worrying about if he will be okay.   I know I can't be selfish and ask him to stay.  Not that he would.  But I hope he will at least stay in contact with me.  I just worry I'll never see him again.

My mind also keeps telling me its all my fault.  As the older sibling I was supposed to be taking care of him, helping him out.  I'm also worried how our cats will feel with him gone.  I know its silly and stupid to worry about that but the cats love him to pieces.   I would say more but I'm just so tired.",Depression
"So back in January I met a girl at a club I went to. I thought she was gorgeous and so I went up to her, talked to her, I got her number and over the next 2 days we went on 2 dates. They went great! We ate, went to the movies, kissed, talked a lot, we connected really well. However, she left to college 8 hours away from me (I live in Miami) back in January. This came with a lot of overthinking and sadness because sheâ€™s not the greatest texter and we didnâ€™t really go on enough dates to set a boundary and communicate it. However, she came back yesterday for spring break and last night, while I went out with some of my friends, I ran into her. She said she was happy to see me but she was really drunk and she was with friends. We kissed (I noticed she was a little hesitant) but I found it impossible to just spend one on one time with her and now Iâ€™m overthinking a good amount. I really enjoyed those 2 dates in January but idk what to make of that whole situation last night. We do have lunch planned on Tuesday but things just arenâ€™t the same",Depression

"I (33/M/Canada) have depressed off and on for over a decade. Iâ€™m gay, single, and generally appear successful with a good job and all. However I am becoming more and more miserable to the point where I canâ€™t do anything except the basics. I fantasize about suicide every day. 

I have a friend group but am becoming more obsessed with worries I donâ€™t belong or that I am not important to my friends. I have always felt I might be on the autism spectrum, albeit high functioning, as social interactions are always terrifying and bewildering to me. I struggle to read signals correctly. Itâ€™s even worse with the depression because I have nothing to talk about it and struggle to carry conversations 

I also worry that I will burden my friends if I share too much with them. About half know about my depression but none know about my constant suicidal ideation. 

I have been trying meds and therapy but I am afraid to be upfront about how bad it is by mentioning suicide. I donâ€™t want to risk being committed at the hospital or losing freedoms. Iâ€™ve read that wonâ€™t happen if they donâ€™t think you have a plan but it still seems like a risk. I also donâ€™t want to risk involving my family who I barely talk to. 

Whenever I try to plan how I can get better, it feels like Iâ€™m just scratching the surface and thereâ€™s too much to fix.

its just my thoughts.. sry if they arent well written..

&amp;#x200B;

Do you ever feel like you screwed up?

I miss you, I can't stop thinking about all of the good times we had.

Yet I hate you.. I hate that i miss you, and I hate that i can't stop thinking about

Everything we used to do.

I don't want these feelings, I want to be happy again even if I'm alone.

Why do I have to miss you.. You made me feel so bad about myself.

I want to see you again but I know from others that you don't feel the same.

We both still have things from each other, whether itÂ´s clothes or anything else..

I want to get my things ofc, and I bet you want your things as well but..

We can't meet..

We couldâ€¦

But you don't want to..

I could just go put them in your mailbox..

But you said it yourself that you don't want to put my things in my mailbox..

So how am I supposed to get my things?

I know you aren't reading this, and I don't actually know if you want to meet.

But iâ€¦

I keep hoping to see you..

Just know if you are reading this..

I was hurt for what you did, you knew it when we talked before too..

Yet your choice was to ignore it..

It wasn't my idea to block you on everything, I didn't want to leave you..

Because I know how that feels..

And i didnt want you to feel that way, with all our memories too.

Yet I choose to listen to my friends, it's for the best they said..

You'll be better off without her..

I can see you're hurting, don't do this to yourself..

And I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt, but..

I got home..

Looked at your apartment..

And in the window.. There he was.. The guy I thought was my friend..

Yet making sure i saw him undress nothing and jumping into bed again..

I..

I.. broke.. I blocked you on everything..

I was so sad and just wanted everything to be overâ€¦

But I wanted to talk to you like you said you would after he went home..

But you didn't want to see me after I left ofcâ€¦

I get it..

But it doesnt change that I still hope you're going to knock on my door some day.

I hope to see you outside with that smile you always had..

But i'm terrified to see you..

Not for what you did that night but..

I'm terrified that I would get all the feeling back..

And I don't think I can handle that break again..

I want a hug.. Like you asked me before he arrived that day..

When you said on that day you still loved me..

And you just wanted to do nothing..

You said you weren't really in the mood for that guy to come but..

You said he had travelled 2 hours to get there and you didn't just want to send him home again..

I gave you your hugâ€¦

you said you were going to over later when he left..

Because it wasn't the plan for him to sleep there..

But he did..

I think I knew it was the last time..

You gave me that smile.. Heartwarming smile..

And I left..

I want my friend for movie nights back..

My..

I want my feelings back..

I keep feeling empty and then my body tries to cheer me up..

But all it keeps showing me is.. You

You at that lovely restaurant..

Those few days before everything went to hell..

I keep seeing that outfit I choose, the makeup I put on you..

The goofy smile I had when we went for our date..

Your heartwarming smile at the table..

Now the chair is always empty in front of me..

And my mind goes..â€™â€™don't worry let me show you whos supposed to sit thereâ€™â€™

I see you..

With that smile..

I miss it..

Yet I hate you for that day..

I hate that you cared to ask me on the phone how I felt about it..

But given my answer I didn't like it at all..

You said.. â€˜â€™Oh, well it's not going to change anythingâ€™â€™

Why did you ask?

Did you even care?

Fast forward a month or so and i was able to get this tiny studio apartment. Little did i know this place is infested with roaches and mice. Not only does it have a pest problem but the electricity shuts off at times. I pay $715 a month for a studio the size of a small office. Thats half of my monthly pay. I can barely afford food, i can barely afford gas to get to work so i can barely afford food. When i tried to get assistance i make ""too much"" to qualify. So i dont make enough to feed myself but i make too much to get help. I started to door dash on the side so i can get groceries and then my accident happened. I was going 45 on a 4 lane road and this woman just decides to gun it out of a parking lot. She didn't even bother to look. By the time i was slamming the brakes and honking the horn we had already collided. I ended up having neck trauma, a broken collar bone and a few broken fingers from the airbag.

 I wish i wasn't wearing my seat belt. I wish the airbag didn't work and instead i just went flying through the windshield. I can't afford a new car, i can't get to work because i can't afford an uber and city transit doesn't go to wear i work. I hate that everyday i get further and further in debt from what seems to things that are completely out of my hands. I just want it to stop. I'm sick of worring about finances, I'm sick of being in pain, I'm sick of constant misery. I don't have the strength to actually kill myself, i wish the accident did it for me.",Depression
"So last week, 11CT, Me (22M), my step dad, and my mom went out to eat. My mom raised me her whole life as a single mother but we arenâ€™t that close, not like super close at least but my step dad was mad that my mom hasnâ€™t been working (which is how itâ€™s been so idk why he got some mad), long story short he pushed his hand to her stomach then smacked her in her mouth, my step dad is way smaller than me so I got up, I was in the living room, and they were in the kitchen), and I punched him once in the mouth and he pushed me back, and I just started pummeling him. My mom was screaming for us to stop and when she said was calling the cops I stopped. Then SHE STARTED YELLING AT ME. Kicked me out of the house, my step dad told me Iâ€™m not working for him anymore, and as he left the house, my mom told me to pack my shit and leave. My buddy in Arizona offered me a spot to go, and I thought I had enough gas to get over there. Iâ€™ve been stuck about a little over halfway there, gas has just got so expensive and has completely fucked me. My mom completely fucked me more than anyone ever has. My own fucking mom.

"I've recently started my 2. semester of college.  
It was fun when I got here at first. I was away from my abusive mother who made me feel like I was loosing my mind, my roommate is cool, new big city, I'm studying what I'm interested in - everything is fine now, right?  
Well I guess the novelty of it has worn off. I feel like I've changed the scenery but not the situation. I still hate myself, I feel bitter and resentful toward other people because it turns out it's not enough to put yourself out there to make friends - you need to be likable too, something I've realized I lack. And it made me hate people, i don't know why.  
I want to be appreciative because I'm privilidged enough to live in a country where uni is  free and my parents pay for everything else. The only thing I'm supposed to do is study and I can't bring myself to do more than the bare minimum.   
It;s like in my head I've created this perfect me that I can't live up to. I'm not beautiful, I'm not likable as i""ve just now figured out, I;m not smart, I'm not passionate about anything. I want to be perceived as hard working ans passionate. I don' t want to be a loser. But I;m just lying to myself. I'm just existing and not doing anytihing with my life. I'm wasting it.

"I'm new on this subreddit and this is my first post so if I say anything that hurts or offends anyone then I apologize. With that said, I'll go into what I want to say. Recently I've been losing control of my life. Like seriously losing control. It all started as I entered college (haha I know another teenager) and I start the year by having big  goals of who I want to be and how well I want to do in college and life in general but slowly as time went on, everything started crumbling around me. My druggie dad started to manipulate my relatives to try and get back into my family and all the bad memories and feelings just came back and I went downhill mentally. I couldn't focus anymore. Everytime I tried to study, every bad memory would rush back and then I'd try to do something fun to get my head straight and go back to studying but it wouldn't work. After my monthly exam finished ( I got disappointing results) I got pissed off at myself. I knew I had no one to blame besides myself and I further spiraled back into depression. ( I've suffered from depression for years because of what my dad used to and if anyone wants more context on that then I'll make another post or just reply to comments). I couldn't sleep anymore and if I did then it would never be good or enough. I'd wake up late and still feel drained and tired. I stopped taking care of myself and gained weight lmao and even though I laugh at that happening my family occasionally makes fun of it and I started bailing out on my friends and i wore bigger shirts that didn't show my stomach. I'd try to get back into shape but I could never summon the will to go further than 3 days. Everything seemed pointless. I'll cut my rambling short (I'm sorry for pointlessly rambling) and just get to the point. I can't sleep anymore, I barely eat and when I do it's just Junk food. Im constantly depressed, tired,stressed and just filled with anxiety all the time. Im just tired of everything at this point. Even the little things. Idk if I'm just overreacting or if I'm slowly going crazy. None of this is fake and If you think it is then fair enough man.

I thought I was getting better mentally for almost 6 monthsbut I f***ing sunk again and I don't know why.

I can't talk to anyone because no one knows what to do or how to help. I just feel worse when I try to talk to anyone. I don't even know what to do, so how is it fair to ask anyone else to help me when I don't even know how to help me.


I feel like I'm drowning one breath at a time. But I have to be the strong, supportive one because people depend on me. My problems will just stress out their already super stressed lives. They don't need my problems added to theirs.

"I (F23) have depression, anxiety, ptsd, and bpd. Diagnosed at diff times so meds were changed a couple of times. My memory is deteriorating so much and so fast. The constant change of medications in the last couple of years has completely destroyed my cognitive abilities. 
I speak 4 languages that I taught myself and was learning 2 more before this mess. Iâ€™m a highly ambitious person. My teachersâ€™ &amp; professorsâ€™ most common comment about me was that I â€œabsorbed knowledge in unbelievable speed.â€ I donâ€™t even remember 99% of the shit I learned for my degree right now. 
Most important part of this is the following: Iâ€™m supposed to go law school within the next 2 years. I worked my whole life for that. Been studying for the LSAT since my freshmen year of undergrad. My score was amazing last time I took it. I wanted to take it just bc I was sure I could do better. I did a few practice tests recently to see how Iâ€™m doing, my score was so fucking low you wouldnâ€™t believe itâ€™s the same person who took it before. How am I gonna succeed in law school like this? 

To say the least, this side effect stings like hell. I donâ€™t even fucking know who I am anymore. I canâ€™t even remember what I read, cuz as soon as Iâ€™m done â€œlearning &amp; memorizing,â€ everything just disappears from my brain. Iâ€™m not working. Like my brain is not working anymore. 
Iâ€™m getting so frustrated with myself. There has to be a way to counteract the side effects somehow. 
I canâ€™t go off my meds. Like no chance. I finally found something that works. This is the first time in ages that I feel like I can even think clearly enough to address my memory problems bc I was too focused on addressing my mental health problems before. 

Have you experienced this? And how have you dealt with it?

tl;dr: how do you address memory problems due to medication?",Depression
"Okay so my mother always needed support. So much support that everything had to be about her life. She never guided me or my sister or taught us how to be on our own. She thinks my life turned out better then hers which my life is the total womanâ€™s nightmare.

My life - A
Iâ€™m 42, font business failed after it was successful. No kids, no home, 70k debt, no friends, no husband, no assets (except my fonts, no boyfriend. Vendors &amp; corporations stole my fonts and wonâ€™t pay for licensing deals. I lost out on my baby making years because  of my busines. I also lost out on my youth years being pulled into my moms drama and to support my mom and dadâ€™s life. My friends used me because of my success and I had psychosis twice because of my business failing. My friends vanished at this point. My boyfriends didnâ€™t love me and just used me for my success and sex. I  recently lost my apartment in a large top city because I canâ€™t afford it. Have to move in with my sister on Wednesday in a shitty northern city.

Mom moms life - B

She had a man (my dad) that she met at 23. They had 3 kids and my dad loved her so much that he would stalk her at bingo. She didnâ€™t have to pay bills or mortgage. My dad paid for everything. She was a nurseâ€™s aid at the nursing home in our town. She got to keep her money because my dad paid for everything. My older brother was a shit disturber and made our lives hell. She focused on helping him and not my sister and I because she said we were good and didnâ€™t need help. She said it was so hard to have kids and a husband and her life was much harder than mine. My dad died of cancer when I was 32 and she said she had to do everything for him during his illness. She said her life was worse. Even though she got what most woman wants. A loving husband, children, a house and car.

"In the last half of last year, I was so depressed that I (22) was struggling to perform at my internship. I was unable to socialize properly. I was crippled with anxiety as well so it was A LOT. I could not perform at my internship and no one in my family tried to understand me at all. At home, my parents were overbearing and put a lot of pressure on me, criticizing me almost every day. At work, even though I was trying my best, I was not doing good enough. It was really hard and sometimes I would just CRASH. I was trying so hard to escape so I was spending almost every weekend drinking with friends just to feel a little happy. I was trying to do the therapy work and work through the issues, but because no one wants to listen or help me on the severity of my depression, I live with it undiagnosed and really really struggling. I put aside money for when I can get some help from a therapist.

iâ€™ve always had trouble letting things go. but like idk whatâ€™s wrong with me. I just got out of a relationship of 14-15 months and my emotions are really bad way worse than theyâ€™ve ever been and iâ€™ve tried to kill my self many times before. It was always my biggest fear losing her and being alone and now it came true. since feb 28th iâ€™ve been alone and fighting suicidal panic attacks/freak outs. i went over to my friends house a couple times but was losing my mind the entire time freaking out not being able to accept the fact iâ€™m never gonna talk to this person again. our relationship ended because i let my anger get out of control the whole reason we fell off was my fault. I tried to control how we were in our relationship because the first couple months we were together there wasnâ€™t commitment so i did anything to make sure it wouldnâ€™t happen again and now i just feel like a piece of shit who deserves to die. weâ€™d argue everyday almost and iâ€™d say 2 day of the week usually weâ€™d be screaming at each other. it got physical at times and before it would happen i would ask her to go home at least 50 times and sheâ€™d beg me to let her stay which would just make me more mad and more mad so that would end in us breaking up then getting back together the next day. all this relationship was me fucking it up with my impulse. i really had a real one and let my ego and overthinking get the best of me. she blocked me on every social media and possible way to contact her. her brother and sister who are older asked how i was doing and so just honestly let them know how much i missed her and just wanted to talk it out as friends and apparently sheâ€™s moving on and is finally feeling happy again. i just donâ€™t get it months and months of me just asking you to go home when we argue so we can cool off then she just blocks me on everything and completely cuts me off. I fucked up not signing out of one of her social medias and seen she already added a couple guys. i feel so lonely all my friends dropped me everybody just tells me to find something that distracts me or helps me feel like my self again but they donâ€™t get how fucking obsessed i am with this person and canâ€™t do anything with how codependent I am. i think we both have trauma from this relationship atleast me with how much weâ€™d scream and cry but it hurts a lot how easy it is for people to move and let go after doing so much together.,Depression

"Iâ€™m 27 years old. From the age of 3, I knew I was transgender. The last time I remember being genuinely happy was when I was 5 years old. Since age 6, Iâ€™ve been on a downward spiral. When I was 8, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and generalized anxiety. At age 15, I began to cut myself, and I seriously considered suicide for the first time. The only reason I didnâ€™t off myself is because I didnâ€™t want my mom to find me. She died a few years ago.

A few months ago, I again considered killing myself. I didnâ€™t do it because I didnâ€™t want my dad to find me. Also, at the time, my brother and aunt died, within weeks of each other. I figured that he couldnâ€™t take any more pain. I checked myself into a mental hospital. That place was a complete joke. The staff didnâ€™t know what the fuck they were doing. After 8 days, I lied and said I was feeling better. I spent about 11 days there.

Iâ€™ve been on testosterone for 5 years. I pass as male, and have a consultation for top surgery. But I will never have a genuine male body, and that hurts. I want to rip my skin off.

Iâ€™m living with a friend right now, and Iâ€™m desperately trying to hold on. After almost 5 months, I relapsed on self harm. When I told her, she was frightened, to say the least. I promised her that I wouldnâ€™t do it again. But that was literally the only coping mechanism that worked. Iâ€™ve tried at least six different meds for depression. They either didnâ€™t work, made me feel numb, or only worked for a few weeks.

I have everything to look forward to. I literally have no reason to be depressed or suicidal. I shouldnâ€™t want to cut myself. Objectively speaking, my life is going well. Yet, here I am.

Iâ€™m an empty husk of a human being. Every breath feels like a chore, every heartbeat, a curse. Depression and gender dysphoria have ruined my chances of a happy life. I literally canâ€™t stop obsessing about killing myself and cutting.

Itâ€™s time for me to die. Soon, Iâ€™m going to build up the courage to kill myself. Unfortunately, my friend will likely be the one to find me. That fucking hurts, but the pain of living like this hurts more.",Depression

"I used to have a lot of friends and family that I could go to and talk to. Over the years, Iâ€™ve had to cut off a lot of family, especially my fathers side, due to toxic behavior. Iâ€™m not really close to my moms side. And now the small amount of friends that I hadâ€¦ Iâ€™m not that close to anymore. They all have their own lives, oneâ€™s getting married, other two starting their careers. We also just donâ€™t have a lot in common anymore. 

I have no one to go to and I have very little support and when I do talk to them, all they want to do is misunderstand what Iâ€™m saying and argue with me. So I just start repressing everything or posting on Reddit. I canâ€™t afford therapy but I didnâ€™t have any success when I did go. I just long for that companionship. That feeling of not being so alone, of having someone to talk to. I donâ€™t have that anymore. I feel like I was just a stepping stone to help them through their problems and they moved on and I got left behind. I feel so alone.",Depression

"Dear people on Reddit maybe youâ€™ll listen, 


Dad- Youâ€™re a nasty person 
Dad- I will never go in her house 
Boyfriend- I think about why Iâ€™m with you I donâ€™t cum with you and if I was with someone I might want to marry them
Mom-What type of daughter are you
Bf- I wish he would love me unconditionally. I wish he wouldnâ€™t have any doubt that he wanted to be with me. He has put me through a lot of roller coasters. He has gas light me a lot. He always says what his attracted to but nothing describes me. I can never tell where I fall with him. Iâ€™m never good enough. Never sexy enough. Never supportive enough. I been over backwards day and not and get nothing in return. Sometimes I wish he would just pick what he wants and stop hurting me mentally. 
Mom- I am tired of being her therapist. I want a regular mom. Someone who loves and cares about to not put me in the middle. I wish she could be strong for me. I wish that she showed me what  to do when a man is not treating you right. Maybe I would be able to stand up. Maybe Iâ€™d be the women My bf might want to marryâ€¦..
Mom- where do I startâ€¦. He didnâ€™t care that my cousin touched me. He even let him in the house many times. He told me that I was nasty and disgusting. He didnâ€™t care if I told my mom because she wasnâ€™t going to do anything. He was right. She couldnâ€™t and wouldnâ€™t take up for me. He told me he didnâ€™t have to answer the phone for me. He said he would never go in my house. Now he wants to talk to ask me why I donâ€™t talk to him or say I love you. He has never said sorry for what he did to me. He was the first man to set the tone on my life and how I picked men. 

My therapist told me that you either pick a man different from your father or the same. Honestly I feel like I picked someone like him. Emotionally unavailable, hurt full, manipulative. I tend to float to people like this both romantically and Friendships. Idk I feel like everyday that past Iâ€™m going to kill my self. I keep picking a day but get to scared. Like I always say oh once everyone is okay or when I pay car off etc. sometimes I wish someone would do it for me. Take the pain away let me be at peace. Away from the hurt and trauma from other people. I remember being choked and passing out all I remember is just a peacefulness. I sometimes miss that feeling. Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m asking fir help just in sudden ways. Like Iâ€™m asking for attention. Iâ€™m scared if no one pays attention soon Iâ€™ll be gone. Like I think about doing it but then I think about how people will be disappointed. But I think about people just moving on and Iâ€™d just be a little bump on road.

I constantly find myself comparing myself to people in everyday life and putting myself down since I am a child, I am just wondering is there anyone else who has had similar struggles their is times I feel like I am completely insane  and like no matter how hard I try I will always fall back into this black hole it makes it extremely hard to to find the motivation to continue with daily life when I was 18 I strongly considered taking my own life after a breakup but I didnâ€™t, but I can feel myself slipping into that same hole again.

I donâ€™t want to get better. Whenever I feel better than miserable Iâ€™m incredibly uncomfortable. I honestly donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever even have the will to try. I just want to stop existing.

I donâ€™t think thereâ€™d be any other way to make me feel content.,Depression
"Here my short story: i have never been diagnosed with depression but when you know, you know.

In September, I moved to Europe (a very sunny and nice climate country) for a job, hoping to find happiness. I have a great teaching job surrounded by sweet students who put a smile on my face. However, outside of work. I'm nothing. I find it impossible to wake up in the morning. somedays when I am off work, I will keep sleeping until 10am, 12pm, 2pm, or until I finally feel like I have some energy. The problem is that when I wake up so late, there's hardly any sun outside and I feel like my day has ended already. 

I only have 2 real friends (one is my boyfriend back in Canada with a 6 hour time difference) and the other friend just sees me when she has no one else to be with. I dont do anything on weekends except play animal crossing, read, play soduku, watch Netflix or go on walks. 

Every, single, day, is a struggle to get out of bed. And when I don't want to get out of bed, I just have no desire for anything. I want to quit my job and die.  And I have ALWAYS felt this way my whole life, no matter what I do. 

I eat healthy, I clean my apartment every weekend, shower everyday, rarely workout but at least get some steps in, and I overall don't have any problems in my life other than my depression. 

Does anyone have advice for me?? Or maybe I just wanted to get this off my chest or for someone to listen to me. Thanks.",Depression
"I was extremely suicidal about two years ago. I was sad, depressed and anxious all of the time. I kept thinking how my mother would react and im sure it would have devastated her. Thats why I didnt do it. I had written my goodbyes and made a clear plan. I was going to hang myself. Somehow I had the courage to open up to my mother and she got me into therapy.

I went to therapy and managed to finish my bachelors. I also got a Job at a fancy hotel and I worked there for about 7 months. But because of my anxiety I havent been able to keep a job. This has made me realize that I have failed and that I wont be able to keep a job. I have been unemployed for 2 months now and my saving are running out sooner that I expected. I know I wont be able to live in the shame again.

So now. I have a plan about my suicide but this time its different. Im calm and caltulated, im not worried about my loved ones because I know they have a strong circle. Im scrared that I actually might do it but at the same time im relieved to know that I can end it all because in the end I dont have to worry about my weaknesess anymore.",Depression
"Hello there,

I am currently feeling like shit.

Okay so let me start by saying some things about myself.

 I am a 17 y/o male and am currently in 2nd year of high school. My family are Asian so expectations of study are tremendous.

I perform reasonably well in my tests, scoring about 80/100 \[Math\] ; 95/100 \[Chemistry\] and 90/100 \[Physics\]. My strongest subject is Chemistry and the weakest is Math. Idk how that helps but thought that it might be helpful while ascertaining my condition.

Since about 3 weeks; i have been feeling a bit low key and am having strange and violent dreams. I had a ""rough"" childhood. My head is constantly hurting while eating, sleeping and hell, even while taking a shit. My thoughts are dark and often lead me to an out-of-body experience (idk if anybody understands that) . I DO NOT TAKE DRUGS.

Well, this condition has happened to me in the past; about 2 years prior. I keep having dreams of killing people and mutilating their dead corpses and collecting something beloved to them as trophies. Some serial killer level shit but i used to control those urges and tried to restrain myself by not interacting with much people apart from my family. THE Pandemic was a good excuse but now, they (parents) are asking questions.

Necrophilia is by far the most insane shit i ever dreamt of earlier. Repression was a great deal of help but now, i feel like I'm sliding down a slippery slope. I'm afraid that i might give into my urges and god forbid; kill somebody.

The urges are at an all time high. Yesterday, i  choked my brother for no apparent reason and he had this look of fear as i let him off. I'm about 5' 9'' while he is about 5' 3''. 

I don't know what i would do so just wanted some help from your side.

" I feel like depression made me more and more stupid in the last few years. 

Can't concentrate or think deeply about anything. Have difficulty developing an interest in literally anything. My mind doesn't wander in different directions anymore, creating hypothetical scenarios or trying to spot patterns in stuff or solving problems. I have become clumsy and forgetful and my observation skills have severely degraded. I'm not as curious as I used to be and have no eagerness left to learn things. Been failing in college because my brain is literally too slow for all the studying I need to do.

My life feels so empty and stuck. I don't even talk to people anymore because I have nothing to say and socialising is very exhausting. I have no friends left anymore. 

I  got diagnosed and started therapy/medication but couldn't continue because I can't afford it rn(being a college student from a third world country with minimal mental health resources available, and what exists is expensive af). 

I tried improving my sleep, diet and physical activity levels but haven't seen any significant changes so far. I still feel so dull and foggy and fatigued in the head.

I now saw what is like to be without depression after all these years, and now i went back down in mood, and it's like i'm under a train and got depersonalization, i feel like my identity is destroyed, how can the mood be such an integrated thing with identity, i mean i lived under a grey cloud for more than half my life, maybe i was too scared to see the sun...

"So, I feel the need to start at the beginning. A week ago, ruffly around this time, a friend of mine I went to highschool with got into a car crash and lost her life. It's been a ruff week for all kinds of reasons. 

The thing I'd like to share however is my slow descent into madness as a result of her death. 

You see, about a year ago, give or take a month or 2, I was hanging out with her and her room when we all started talking about a car crash she was in a few months earlier. Her room mate noted a couple of car crashes and I off handedly made a joke about her doing it on purpose. Because she was drunk as however, he started going off on how if she had waited for the roads to be icier, she would have died and her kids could have gotten the insurance money. She went into how there are nicknames for the time of year and that no one would really bat an eye at it. I made sure her roommate (and self proclaimed best friend) knew what was going on and I tried to talk her out of it. I thought I had...

Fast forward to last week. We had shit weather all weekend and she ends up getting into a car crash. 

I can't say anything for certain. I don't even feel like it's my place to say anything to anyone about it. 

I've been crying on and off for the last couple days. Beating myself up for not being a better friend even though she didn't want me in her life anymore.

I'm feeling a lot and I don't have anyone to really turn too. Probably why I'm making this post. Because this is the internet I'm expecting to get nothing but hate but hell, I probably deserve it.

I thought and said â€œno big deal who caresâ€ Everything went absolutely amazing, we talked every day for hours. We went out to dates all the time and when it finally came up. She was afraid to admit it. Because from the beginning it was â€œno feelings just funâ€ but we admitted we had fell madly in love. We started saying it a lot, we didnâ€™t know what we were going to do but for the next 3 months we saw each other at least once a week with work and school. But then inexplicably we started talking less she told me â€œwe canâ€™t say love anymoreâ€ I was just trying to hold on to the ONLY true happiness I had had in years. So I agreed just Fwb. But then we grew more distant, for weeks I desperately was trying to just see her. She could never make time and she just kept telling me she was busy but wanted to see me, I got to see her once at her school before I left town because of my transient job. I told her Iâ€™d quit. I told her Iâ€™d stay if I could just see her every few weeks. Iâ€™d do anything she asked. She told me to leave, so I left. I went to my next job. Got back with my on and off GF for the last 7-8 years and life went on. We talked sometimes Iâ€™d buy her coffee; but a year later she just texts me â€œyou must think Iâ€™m a heartless bitch, fuck youâ€ I tried to see what she was talking about but she started blocking me on everything. Then she texted me â€œIâ€™m done I canâ€™t do this anymoreâ€

"22F here, I moved across the country to Wyoming from Florida with my boyfriend (28M) who I wasnâ€™t even with for a year yet. Stupid, I know. I quit my job that I loved, I left the place I called home, and had hopes for a clean slate in a new state. 

Things arenâ€™t going smoothly. Itâ€™s the total opposite of what I expected. Sexual issues, communication has gotten the worst itâ€™s ever been, minor but continuous lies from my boyfriend, which he told me heâ€™d be better about, lack of trust in him due to his lies. Baggage on his end causing major strain between the two of us (Mother in law, exes) . I made sure to not bring any baggage here on my end. Since I quit my well paying job in Florida to come here, my credit cards havenâ€™t gotten paid since November and my bank account is -$500. He told me he was gonna take care of me financially. He hasnâ€™t.

I lived alone with my dog and guinea pigs back in Florida for 2 years before I met my current boyfriend. I was stable in nearly every sense. I was happier. My moods and feelings werenâ€™t reliant upon some guy. I was in control of my own moods and emotions. I miss that so much. I miss my little overpriced 1 bed 1 bath apartment back in Florida that I had to myself. What am I doing with my life now?

I threw away everything I valued and loved about my life for some guy that canâ€™t even be honest with me on a consistent basis. For a guy that needs to be trained and told like a dog how to be romantic for me. For a guy who just doesnâ€™t understand me even though he likes to act like he does. I am so stupid. God, I am so stupid.

And you wanna know what the worst part is? I donâ€™t think I can get that blissful life I had before him back. I make $400 a month now. Iâ€™m not only broke, Iâ€™m in severe debt now. Things will never be the same. Because of my decisions. I hate myself, and I wish my overdose actually worked back when I was 18. I guess I canâ€™t even do that right. Iâ€™m quite literally good for nothing. I shouldâ€™ve done better for myself than this. I know better. I let my heart decide for me.

I regret not letting myself hang when I had the chance, its just that, my poor fuckin dog Quigley didnt understand, it broke me to see him tilt his damn head. Idk, I just.

"I am a 15 year old girl who deals with family issues and a bad reputation. In school, Iâ€™m nervous and quiet and at home Iâ€™m very loud and moody. Iâ€™m a passive aggressive person when Iâ€™m irritated or sad so I tend to say a lot of shit that I donâ€™t mean that can hurt people. I have isolated myself from social media and friends. My family found out I self harmed daily (my sister hid all my razors and scissors but I keep a secret sharpener in my school bag-it doesnâ€™t cut deep so Iâ€™m constantly stressed.) I donâ€™t like talking about my self harm cutting issue so my family doesnâ€™t talk about it or question me since I yell and give them the silent treatment. People told me that Iâ€™m moody and say that Iâ€™m crazy or bipolar (I often get insults like narcissistic or a stupid bitch.) they question how I go from being funny and laughing to irritated and angry. Everyone is generally annoyed with me and tell me that there is something wrong with me (I sometimes think so but I canâ€™t find the answer.) my dad used to physically and emotionally abuse me when I was very young and he did it in front of countless of people (he has stopped but I dealt with bruises, blood blisters, damaged eye, and emotional stress around him.) I also dealt with anger issues in church and I fought and lashed at anyone because I was so short tempered and emotional (I would hit myself if I was really angry and stressed.) I was often hiding under tables at school and nervous when everyone was sitting around in the carpet and I was afraid of being near anyone. I was taken out of class to a quiet doll room and got in trouble a lot (I would get put in the corner to reflect on myself.) people say Iâ€™m very immature so Iâ€™ve been working on becoming a better person and I have big dreams. I think I deal with depression and anxiety but Iâ€™m not sure myself since I know I need a professional doctor to diagnose me (honestly I donâ€™t need a diagnosis I just need a answer to my problems.) I actually got taken to a doctor for a screening test by my dad (he lied about where we were going.) I answered every question no because I felt afraid and useless so I didnâ€™t want to reveal my emotions and thoughts. The doctor saw my scars but I got all irritated and told him that it is my privacy and he shouldnâ€™t touch me or force me to roll my sleeves and pants. We left without a problem and it was silent in the car ride. At the end of the church, I was stressed too much and while my dad was driving the car and telling me how I should stop and change how I look and act, I got very annoyed so I opened the door and thought of ending myself but he stopped immediately and I walked out through the streets until it was night and he found me and took me home. I went inside my room and cut myself until I bled and cried to myself silently while thinking of ending it all (the sharpener didnâ€™t go too deep vertically but I went over the same cut until I was satisfied and could not feel like crying anymore.) after he knocked on my door, I opened it and he cried. I felt so guilty but I was annoyed at everything and everyone. I pushed him out and locked my door again. Iâ€™m so useless and stupid. I just want help for my problems but Iâ€™m so scared. Why am I like this? I want to try so hard to change. I canâ€™t even face my fears Iâ€™m such a pussy. Please anyone give me advice and Iâ€™m sorry if itâ€™s too long. I donâ€™t want it to be longer. Sorry.(I downloaded Reddit since a lot of people were asking questions here.)",Depression
"I have a great job and a good family, but they donâ€™t understand that my life feels useless and like Iâ€™m wasting it away just working almost every day and never enjoying anything it has brought me. I have no hobbies because Iâ€™ve stopped caring about almost everything in my life. I want to move away and start a new life somewhere else with a few friends in Texas but Iâ€™m afraid to tell my parents how I feel and Iâ€™m stuck in this same loop of not wanting to disappoint anyone and wanting to live my own life.",Depression
"I got new meds that helped with suicidal thoughts, intent and ideation. But now I just feel miserable. 

I can't explain it, but when I'm suicidal I feel more at peace with my misery. It almost feels good, cause it feels like there's a visible end to my pain.

But now there's nothing. Just depression and me, with no way out. Meds take forever to work, and that's even if they work. Sometimes it can take months to find the right blend/dosages. And in that time, I must just sit in this never ending low mood.",Depression
"Euphoria 

Symptoms of euphoria include feeling happy or hopeful, increased self-esteem and finding increased pleasure in things you  enjoy.

There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling energised, sleeping deeply, having a good appetite and sex drive, and various waves of pleasure on the body.

The symptoms of euphoria range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently high spirited, while severe euphoria can make you feel extremely motivated, that life is worth living.",Depression
"My husband still has no idea, no empathy, no understanding of depression. Granted I never discus it with him, but still. I have in The past and he just doesnâ€™t understand or get it. My house is not cluttered, dirty, etc. but I do get lazy with laundry, which he has never done in his life. He literally screamed and yelled this morning over socks. In fact I find his socks under the bed, on the floor in the living room etc. then I was screamed at because his other work pants werenâ€™t clean when he has 3 folded pairs I put in his draw today. Yea, not the color he wanted. 
We have some major financial obstacles right now and a ton of stress going on. My depression is at an all time low right now or should I say high. Itâ€™s really bad. Iâ€™ve struggled for years but the past 3 years have been incredibly gut wrenching. Everyone is lucky I leave my bed at this point and I only do it so Iâ€™m not yelled at.

"How do I pretend to be normal. I cut myself for the first time tonight. I need it away to distract from I felt on the inside. I have no desire to stop the bleeding.

"I don't like going places because I'm scared about being treated badly. I don't like meeting people because I assume they won't like me. I was mistreated most of my life and as a result have terrible anxiety and extremely self-conscious. I'm always scared of looking stupid or embarrassing myself. I know looks aren't everything but to be honest I really would like to be complimented. I have had so-called ""friends"" tell me that nobody cares about me and that I'm ugly. I try to put make-up on or do my hair to help me feel better but it doesn't work. A lot of times I feel like it would have been better if I never would have been born. I have so much self-hatred it's ridiculous. I have seriously considered trying drugs to try to numb my feelings. Every day I just wish someone would genuinely like me.

"I am a 16 year old boy currently going to an art high school. I need to vent about quite a few things. First of all, I'm gay and I've been out for two years now, but the loneliness somewhat didn't go away. I'm in a relationship and I love him dearly, but I find myself sexually unsatisfied, and sometimes wishing we did more. I usually feel incredibly guilty after these thoughts as he loves me very very much, and I can tell that, and yet I'm slowly struggling to feel the same. 

My relationship with love and sex was fucked up a super long time ago, or at least it feels like that. It happened when I was 13. I have an older brother. He's a lot for me to deal with. He's from a previous relationship of my dad's, and is much older than me. He is obsessed with his looks and has been for a very long time, and also is severely mentally ill from various trauma inducing events as a teenager. As a younger chubby boy, I was his target. I was socially persecuted and cast aside while my sisters got all the attention. This made me hate him, and yet I was obsessed with his attention. I wanted him to care about me. In a really twisted way, I fetishized it, made it sexual. Especially since I felt so physically inferior. I was not out at this time but I knew I was gay, and I was easily able to tell the signs that others were gay that straight people don't seem to understand until later in life. My older brother was clearly gay to me. I began trying to make him like me, bond in any way possible. In ended in potentially the worst thing that has ever happened to me, but yet was my choice. 

We ended up having sexual interactions even though he was much older than me and I was very young. At the time I was incredibly determined to continue these interactions as I'd never felt that sense of care in my life before. It was horrific and I would get nauseous afterwards, but yet I kept being obsessed with the idea of me being something sexually attractive. My body was very unconventionally attractive at the time and I was incredibly insecure, so I forced myself to keep doing things with him. At a certain point it just stopped, and we never did it again. I tried to talk about it once to him but he closed up a lot and I've never tried again. I cannot tell anyone because of the worst part about this story: I was the rapist at first.

I was the one who was cuddling with him as his little brother, and ended up pulling his pants down that first time. I made the hell that I lived in for next year. I deserved it all. 

After it all stopped with my brother I needed another sexual outlet for validation and relief. I had all things romantically important stolen by older men in the back of cars or in small apartments. I was only 14 and my first kiss was a thirty eight year old who I had multiple sexual encounters with. I met with as many men as possible. Clogging my after school schedule with sharing myself. The most addicting part of it was that nauseous feeling I felt. It continued ever since that encounter with my brother, but now I was obsessed with it. It made me unable to eat, or really to think. It was like a drug. Since I wasn't eating I was the thinnest I'd ever been. It only gave me more reason to keep doing it. By 15 I had gotten into the school I'd wanted to go to since fourth grade, and that distracted me for a bit.

I met people, and they made the disgusting world of rape disappear for awhile. It was clean, childish, teenage, fun. I really liked them. We opened up to each other a lot, in unhealthy long winded ways, but it was something at least. It all ended badly. I eventually told them about my sexual experiences. I told them that I was happy that I was doing it. They adamantly fought against my actions, until I did it again. Then it was a joke to them. It became my personality. I was the gay boy who had sex with older men. That was what I was to them, and it was hilarious. They'd make jokes where they'd just say numbers, the age of a guy I had told them about, and they'd laugh. I laughed too, even though I didn't find it funny.

Luckily I didn't have to end those friendships, they did it themselves. They were self cannibalizing attention hungry average teenagers, and eventually I was the problem. I was too sexually confident, to openly gay because of the things I had done. They had the strangest jealousy. Their jealousy turned into anger against me. Their jealousy pushed me away from them. Their jealousy was sick.

Having to stand up for myself that one time made a lot of changes to my character.

I stopped my unhealthy interactions with older men. I focused on being a kid. I met people I really enjoy now, and really like talking to. All of this would be great except for the fact that I'm empty. My art is empty. My relationship with one of the prettiest and most interesting boys my age is empty. I don't know what to do. Worse than that, I'm gaining weight. My self hate used to manifest strongly enough that I had an eating disorder to keep weight off, but now that I've gone through the process of battling some of my negative thought patterns, I can't muster that hate. I've begun to feel as though without the touch of older men my body has bloomed into a disgusting new form, and my life has just become a series of lies to myself. I'm starting to see those same patterns of jealousy in my friends as well. Annoyance. I'm just a nuisance. I carry so much already that to carry a burden of a friend is too much. I've ruined myself. I've lost things that never will come back, and simply cannot come back.  

In many ways I miss being a victim. I miss being raped. I miss the world shattering emotional sensations of ruining my self image. I miss the feelings of being thin and wanted. I miss being someone who had to be saved, rather than someone who has to save others. My friends see me and they see someone much more competent than I really am. I just need a floor to stand on, and yet I ask for what I cannot give to others.

I want to be beautiful again, and I want to feel terrible again, and I want to feel virile again.

But I don't really want it, it's just what feels normal, and normal is what my brain always thinks I want.

I'm the emotionally healthiest I've ever been, but I'm struggling with making it normal. How do I make this state of ok-ness something that just happens? How do I accept my body in a way that'll let me healthily improve upon it? How do I feel sexually satisfied in my relationship without not only ruining it but pulling my boyfriend down with me? What is wrong with me? Is my life ruined?

"currently I would say I am doing better than what I once was a year ago. But frankly, it's mostly because of covid being less impactful in our lives now.

I talk to myself in my head a lot more, something that I restrained myself from doing when I was severely depressed, but the thoughts are about passive suicide. I talk to more people and girls, but it's just making me feel empty. I'm forcing myself to do all these things to feel like I'm doing something to become better. But I don't feel really ""better."" And when my mom says that I look a lot better/don't have depression anymore, I hate it because I am not better. I am not happy. 

I'm not in danger of suicide right now because I vowed that I will kill myself when I turn 21. Since I what to do some things before I go. I really want someone I can turn to, but it doesn't seem like it'll ever happen especially while talking to loads of people right now...

"But it turns out, I was just getting worse. 
Itâ€™s the same thing every day. I donâ€™t even want to move anymore. The only reason I go to work is because I have to and work with my family. If I didnâ€™t, Iâ€™d have lost my job by now. On the weekends all I do is drink and do drugs until I fall asleep at like 6 in the morning and wake up at noon and do it again Sunday. I donâ€™t even feel anything on drugs anymore. Iâ€™ve lost all interest in everything I used to love. I donâ€™t see a point in anything. I donâ€™t even feel anything. I feel like I want to get better, but I know it probably wonâ€™t change anything so I donâ€™t even want to try. On top of that thereâ€™s the constant suicidal thoughts and mental breakdowns, all of the intrusive thoughts and fighting back the urges to hurt myself until I feel something. All of the feelings of worthlessness and all of the restless nights staring at nothing and having your mind just scream at you for hours on end. Iâ€™m just so tired of it all. Thereâ€™s only so much I can take and I just want it to go away. I donâ€™t even know how or where to get help and if I did, I canâ€™t afford it. I just feel so fucking lost and alone and I know thatâ€™s just how it is. Thatâ€™s life I guess.",Depression
