I got diagnosed with dissociation about 2 weeks ago but it started around may last year after I smoked some weed with buddies in the woods. It wasnâ€™t my first time but this time it just felt different and Iâ€™ve been feeling out of it and my brain has been foggy since that night. Is there a way ne smoking could have caused it? And is it safe to try smoking again?,General_disorder
"After I feel someone has mistreated me theres a snap in my mind and no matter how long I've known them, they immediately feel like a stranger. For example, I had a bad relationship with my father and one day he came into my room before he went to work (he was crying) and basically told me I was embarrassing and then kicked me out. There was immediately a switch in my brain and he felt like a complete stranger. I have nightmares about trying to escape him frequently. The most recent time this ""snap"" happened was about 3 or 4 days ago, this time with my brother. He has never respected my boundaries and I've always been slightly scared of him. We got into a fight the other day that I knew was going to happen and I didn't give him any reaction, he just kept yelling at me telling me I was a ""fucking prick"" and basically told me that he thinks I'm a shitty person in every way he could think of. I just let him cuss me out and then he slammed my door and left continuing to yell about how shitty I am. I didn't notice the snap yet but now it's clicking. I had a nightmare about him like 1 or 2 nights later very similar to the ones I had with my father. Now I want nothing more than to get as far away from him as possible. I'm obviously aware he's my brother but I no longer feel any emotional connection to him. I don't understand why this happens to me and I just want to know if anyone else experiences this.",General_disorder

"My(28F) mom (74F) has been diagnosed with Delusional Disorder last year. The psych dr never told her the diagnosis and confirmed to me after I asked and said the nurse read me his notes from my moms first appointment. 
I didnâ€™t ask if there was a reason to withhold the info, I just assumed with her paranoia she wouldnâ€™t believe him. 

Background: 
About a year and a half ago my mom started getting extra paranoid. Sheâ€™s always been that way, but way worse since my dad passed away. My mom thinks her family is keeping her away from the man she loves (a man she hasnâ€™t actually seen in 30 years). She thinks this guy has been sending her music on Spotify and that he placed people that look like him around her one day to â€œplay a joke on her.â€ 
I talked with my step aunt and she recently she got in contact with him and said heâ€™s happy with his life and has no want to contact my mom. (I havenâ€™t told her that). 
Anytime I try to reorient my mom, such as ask her why someone would do something to her or why someone would care, she says â€œwell, I donâ€™t know!â€ And gets very irritated I donâ€™t believe her. 

Other examples are when she thinks her brother hired people to hack her email. She thinks her boss is dating the man she loves and thatâ€™s only because the boss said a vague general comment to my mom. My mom is now retired, but she was at the point where she wanted to punch her boss with how mad she was at the things she thought she was doing. 
Every time I speak to my mom she mentions how something has disappeared, implying someone took it, or just another comment about her family  controlling her life. Even though they donâ€™t live in the same state and have no reason or want to control my mom, 

The dr tried 2 different antipsychotics, my mom voiced that one made her not sleep and the other made her drowsy and she was concerned of falling. She only took 1-2 doses of these meds. 

The dr discharged her bc she said she didnâ€™t think she needed to go and he said that was fine, unless she feels scared for her life and then to come back and see him. 

My therapist thinks maybe telling my mom she has this disorder will help her understand why she thinks the way she does? 
Also! If anyone has any groups or something to help me understand how to handle my moms disorder, thatâ€™d be awesome.",General_disorder

"I'm not self-diagnosing, just looking for some advice. 

Let me start from the beginning.   

I am a sophomore in high school

About a week ago, right before falling asleep, I noticed that I would get these random intrusive thoughts that were unrelated to anything I was thinking about or doing prior. Like a word or phrase would randomly pop into my head. I didn't hear them though, but they were uncontrollable.   

I had a difficult time going to sleep that night and just hoped that it would be gone by the morning. The next morning I woke up with this very distinct headache on the back, left side of my head I took some ibuprofen to  relieve the pain and it didn't help. I still have the same headache to this day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the past couple days, I've had trouble putting my thoughts into words, comprehending simple things, and paying attention. also my memory has been terrible lately. I almost feel like my IQ has decreased by 50%. I'm also still having those intrusive thoughts right before going to sleep. I have not had any hallucinations, delusions, or anything like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, I've also been derealizing lately---feeling like I'm not there. Let me just list my symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Trouble focusing

\-Headaches

\-intrusive thoughts

\-anxiety

\-Memory problems

\-trouble comprehending things

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, maybe I'm being dramatic. But I've been falling down rabbit holes and really freaking myself out. I'm hyper focusing on everything that I'm doing and afraid that I'm going to lose my mind. And this back of the head headache is driving me crazy.",General_disorder
"Iâ€™ve been on Zoloft the past 6 months, starting at 50mg and moving up to 100mg a few months ago. Since I started Iâ€™ve noticed that even when I have energy to move throughout my day, I donâ€™t feel fully there mentally. Iâ€™ll have conversations with people and realize that Iâ€™m sort of on autopilot. My anxiety is way down, but Iâ€™m working with my psychiatrist to taper off Zoloft and Iâ€™ll be moving to just Effexor soon; Iâ€™m down to 50mg now. Iâ€™m feeling the grogginess more than ever now that Iâ€™ve decreased my dosage 2 weeks ago, and Iâ€™m wondering if this will go away soon or if anyone had similar experiences. Likewise, did you experience grogginess on Effexor? Any input would be helpful.",General_disorder
"So I've been working on getting better. As part of that I've been taking my dog for walks, yesterday I added about an 1/8 or so mile to our walk. Experiencing significant anxiety increase.( The best I can figure is that due to the severity of my panic attacks in the past, my mind has a pavlovian response to physical exertion as it shares many similarities to a moderate and severe panic attack. So if you know of any cognitive techniques or meditations to work through this kind of cross connection in neural pathways I'd appreciate your sharing. That's not why I'm writing this ) after being uncomfortably anxious for about 4 hours I decided to try and sleep it off, sometimes this works. Took a nap, had a dream were I was just as anxious, did some dream stuff to stop being anxious. Didn't work, so my dream self took a nap to sleep it off, putting me back here maybe a little more anxious than when I went to sleepðŸ˜‹ I think my subconscious just told me to deal with it myself!",General_disorder

"Currently I am writing this in tears...man, so many things happened. I know I have a very weak mental health and that makes me cry so much more. I often type about my problems and I know nobody gives a fuck, or if somebody does then I will get this people so much about my problems that they will hate me. Anyway, so what is my problem. Since I was born I was so weak and everybody was giving me presents, and didnt care. But then, after I grew up, people started to say bad things about me like ""he cannot do something"". I knew that I can but all the times they said about it they touched my weakest points where I really couldnt some type of a thing. After that, I got myself into object sexuality ""the thing when you believe something(like a car) is alive and you make a relationship with it"". So, I did that. Wherever someone said bad about me, I was always like ""I have my car, I am really not bad, I care about her,  I am not bad"". That was like a whole thing that motivated me, that was saying I am not bad. But then, I understood everything was fake and fell in depression ""yes I really did, because of so much stress"". After 6 months, my depression was gone. But, there is no thing that can motivate me right now like that. So I got into myself, only in my thoughts I feel safe. I started to enjoy being alone. I just didnt want to be like ""You are too young"" ""You are too small"". Only in myself I found the truth that I am not like this. I hated these families where somebody banned something and said that you shouldnt touch it, controlled somebody. I found myself happy in PC""s, the thing that would motivate me. 
And then the accident happened. I got really nervous after that. So, my pc broke, not the one that is ""mine"" but the one that was gifted to me. I tried to fix it. And, my parents just got me. They said why do I need to grab a mouse. And I told them. And they got really angry and said like ""YOU SHOULDNT TOUCH IT"". After that, I remember all 13 years of pain and offend, like I am a fucking pussy who cant do something, like I am only a problem. When everybody was judging me. And right now it is also like this. Everybody just fucks about me, they just say about my problems always. Like I need to do something, I need to fix something, I am a lazy ass, I am a bad person, I am an egoist. YOU DONT KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I TRIED TO FIX MYSELF! TO FIX EVERYTHING, BUT YOU KEPT SAYING ABOUT MY PROBLEMS! LIKE I CANNOT FIX A FUCKING PC, LIKE I AM TOO SMALL! And so, I fought with my dad. Then I got really deep in myself. I never want to be with someone no more. I want to be alone. Forever. Just shut up please. All your problems about me. I just wanna skydive in my thoughts, they are safe and all. And the problem is. Whenever I am going with someone. Here is an example. Yesterday my teacher said we should all work in group and no exceptions because there is a big event coming. And I just dont wanna do this. I wanna be alone. I wanna fuck on everyone. I wanna be safe. I wanna be single forever, because everybody fucks about me, and they just harm me everytime, with my ""problems"". I know I am not ideal, but man, I WILL CHOOSE WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO DO, I AM NOT A LITTLE PUSSY! I AM TIRED WEARING A MASK OF ""I AM FINE"" WHEN YOU ASK ME ABOUT IT, I JUST WANNA HARM YOU SO YOU LL SCREAM LIKE DEVIL BEING PUNISHED MY DOOMSLAYER, I WANNA BE FUCKING ALONE, ALONE, ALONE, FOREVER!  YOU VE DID IT TO ME, THIS DEPRESSION, I WAS SUFFERING FOR FUCKING 6 MONTHS, AND I FEEL NO POINT RIGHT NOW WHY SHOULDNT I KILL YOU FOR THAT! ALL YOU DID IS CLOSED EVERYTHING FOR ME, SAID THAT YOU ARE BETTER, DID EVERYTHING THAT I SHOULD VE DID, AND THEN SAID THAT I AM HARM TO YOU! HOW CAN I SMILE AND BE HAPPY WHEN I AM MAD AND PUT ON A MASK, HOW CANNOT I PLAY DOOM AFTER BEING WITH THIS MARAUDERS TRYING TO GET ME OFF FROM SOMETHING, LIKE I CANNOT DO THIS? LIKE I AN IDIOT, IN MY THOUGHTS I'VE GOT BIGGER THEN YOU, I AM BETTER THAN YOU, I KNOW WHY YOU DO SO TO ME, AND YOU ARE GOING TO PAY FOR MY SUFFERINGS! LIKE I AM FINE WHEN I JUST CRY FOR 5 HOURS BECAUSE YOU OFFEND ME SO MUCH, FUCKING MAN, I AM AFRAID I WILL TURN INTO A JOKER IF YOU WILL OFFEND ME ALWAYS LIKE THAT!

"Iâ€™ve done some research myself, but I in no way trust myself to interpret online psychological evaluations that may or may not actually be accurate, nor in ANY way am I asking anyone here for a diagnosis. If you know of similar conditions that might relate to this I donâ€™t have an issue with you mentioning it, Iâ€™d like to do some of my own research prior to my appointment with a therapist.

Here goesâ€¦

Ever since I was a kid, I have suffered with this strange issue. For context, I was never a popular kid at school, nor was I a social butterfly in any of my own relationships.

When I am talking with others, I will suddenly feel extremely overwhelmed. I will hear them talking, but Iâ€™m not listening to what theyâ€™re saying. The words flow in my ears, but they have no meaning whatsoever. As I struggle to try to understand the person speaking to me, I start to have physical pain in my head, like my brain is explodingâ€”sometimes itâ€™s so crippling that I have to just walk away from the conversation and recover. I literally feel compelled to get away from the situation because my brain feels so overwhelmed by its inability to follow the conversation. In my adult life, it hinders my adult relationships, eg, my family, my friends, my coworkers and bosses at my job, etc, because I am often unable to stay focused without feeling a severe inability to focus.

Same thing happens to me with activitiesâ€”and itâ€™s not just activities I donâ€™t enjoy, I canâ€™t even do things I love or want to do because of this. For example, if Iâ€™m in a work meeting, I feel like â€œugh a work meeting, I can do this, I just have to get through itâ€ and I sit there and try my absolute hardest to listen to the meeting, but as Iâ€™m sitting there, I begin feeling extremely overwhelmed and unable to focus on the words being said. In another example, I tried to watch a YouTube video (about 20mins long) the other day, and I couldnâ€™t get through it even though I WANTED to watch it. I had to shut it off, I developed a severe migraine and only what I could describe as â€œmental anguishâ€ and couldnâ€™t focus on anything for an hour or so, and then I got back to life and never tried watching it again.

Iâ€™ve struggled with reading my entire life as well. I read words but I donâ€™t understand them. I have to read a page of a book 4-6 times over before I actually comprehend its meaning. I canâ€™t follow 3-sentence-long baking instructions on an instant cake box, my brain becomes so frustrated. Texting is easier for me than a phone call, but both are so difficult for me to follow, it takes me 10-15 straight minutes to structure a reply to a 3-sentence text message from a friend. I feel extremely inefficient, to put it lightly. 

I soldiered through school reading assignments and was able to get through using Cliffâ€™s Notes as backup and trying my absolute best to do wellâ€”I was an A/B student, so it wasnâ€™t horribly debilitating for me back then. In fact, I would say that now as an adult it has affected me more than ever in my entire life. Itâ€™s gotten to the point where I canâ€™t even listen to music while doing a task like cleaning or driving somewhere in my car because my brain feels mental anguish over trying to focus on both the lyrics and the task at hand. I canâ€™t do podcasts, eitherâ€”big surprise. I have gotten headaches in the car while riding along with others who like listening to musicâ€”and the headaches were so bad that I had to put my head down and close my eyes and beg my friends to turn off the music. It has made me cry before, because I feel so angry and frustrated that my brain wonâ€™t let me focus on basic things. 

Well, a lot of times, I end up hurting peopleâ€™s feelings. Iâ€™ll be in a 3+ people conversation, and suddenly I can no longer pay attention. Iâ€™m struggling to understand and stick with the conversation, but my brain literally cannot keep up. I begin to feel the head pain, and I just instinctively remove myself from the situation entirely by excusing myself and walking away for solaceâ€”and then people think Iâ€™m upset or that they said or did something wrong. Same with trying to watch moviesâ€”Iâ€™ll get 20 mins in, and I canâ€™t do it anymore, even when Iâ€™m watching by myself and not in a group setting.

I did it my entire childhood, tooâ€”I used to play games on the playground with the other kids, and the moment my brain became frustrated with the task I was doing, I immediately removed myself from the game or activity. It wasnâ€™t distraction, per seâ€”I didnâ€™t feel a sudden urge to do something else, only a sudden urge to immediately stop doing what I was doing at the time.

I do it all the time as an adultâ€”I feel a sudden urge to â€œescapeâ€ the situation thatâ€™s making my brain upset, even though I have nothing better to be doing, and sometimes the activity Iâ€™m trying to escape is something I WANT to be doing. Itâ€™s so upsetting, because I want to talk and relate with others, I want to watch movies, and I want to listen to musicâ€”but the physical and mental anguish I feel when I try to force myself is unbearable.

Is someone on this forum able to try to give me an idea of how to deal with this? I am planning on seeing a therapist very soon, but I would like to get opinions from anyone who might be familiar with or suffer with these symptoms themselves and suggest how I can help myself in the short-term prior to my appointment. Thank you!",General_disorder
I never experienced anything like this before. I get days where I feel ok and then I feel really anxious. Some nights I can't get to sleep. I hear voices and sounds when I'm  about asleep.

"(I would ask this on the bipolar subreddit but Iâ€™m not yet diagnosed and I donâ€™t want to look like Iâ€™m fishing for one)

I have days where I feel all the hypomanic/manic symptoms but the intensity of them usually last about a day and after it doesnâ€™t feel as intense.I donâ€™t know to track the â€œmaniaâ€ if I donâ€™t know how itâ€™s supposed to feel over time.

Do I lose the delusional thoughts and just keep the energetic feel over a couple of days? But then how do separate Bipolar energy and ADHD energy? Or is the energy I feel due to mania because most pros say that I am ADHD(primarily inattentive)? Any help would be appreciated",General_disorder
"This might come across as if I am dumb and donâ€™t understand other peoples way of dealing with things but these are feelings Iâ€™ve had for a long time and I need a safe place to share it. Iâ€™m actually so tired of seeing everyone think theyâ€™re mentally ill. 
Donâ€™t get me wrong Iâ€™m all for mental health awareness but thereâ€™s a difference between feeling depressed / anxious and actually having an illness that makes it IMPOSSIBLE to function. 
Like how can you â€œhave ADHDâ€ and still turn in every assignment on time? Whereâ€™s the ADHD? How can you â€œhave depressionâ€ and still get out of bed everyday? and text all your friends back? Whereâ€™s the depression? 

Medicine doesnâ€™t fix it, treatment doesnâ€™t fix it, â€œworking harderâ€ doesnâ€™t fix it.

"Rant ahead:

Iâ€™ve had this type of same problem in my past relationships. When I would have a breakdown one would normally expect your partner to be there for you to comfort you, correct? Because this is what my therapist at the time told me that our partners should take care of each other when we are in need of comfort. But my partner at the time would just watch me breakdown and not do anything not even be an inch close to me, he would just wait it out. Until he told me one time, which is probably the worst thing told to me is, â€œhe feels like a babysitter when Iâ€™m having a mental breakdownâ€. (I experience Derealization/Depersonalization) this was the reason I would breakdown maybe once or twice a month because I was having a massive episode. 
I had told this to my therapist and she said that was not right for him to do. Time passes by we end our relationship on good terms and he apologizes for doing that to me and realizes it wasnâ€™t right to do that to me.

Now the present: I am currently with a new partner and it somehow popped into our conversation but I had let him know about this type of situation with my ex. And he told me that was really bad and that he felt bad that happened to me and that he would never do such thing. This started happening more recently and he has started doing the exact same thing. I have a breakdown out of no where or a panic attack and he just keeps doing what he was previously doing. Iâ€™m crying in the middle of the room and he just ignores me. I donâ€™t know if I am just to full of myself or what am I doing wrong? Am I asking for too much? I just need a little bit of comfort like how I show to him? Is it all in my head? Why does this happen to me in different relationships is it me? 

I need an outside look on this. Please.",General_disorder
"Iâ€™ve been struggling with dysthymia with recurring episodes of major depression since I was 12. I didnâ€™t even plan on making it past the age of 18. 

In spite of all the pain I managed to be a very successful student. It was the only way I knew how to cope. But I eventually broke down halfway through college and my life has only gotten worse from there. I am fortunate enough to have a great family and their financial support, which I know many people donâ€™t have, but everything else has gone to shit since I dropped out. Itâ€™s too much to write about here. 

After going through 10+ medications and bad side effects (to put it mildly - one landed me in the hospital twice), I finally decided to try TMS last year. It actually helped for a couple months until a sudden life event caused yet another depressive episode. Iâ€™m fighting this one as hard as I can because I donâ€™t want to get to the point that I become bedridden again, but Iâ€™m just so tired. Iâ€™m now looking into ketamine treatment. If that doesnâ€™t work then probably psilocybin, if *that* doesnâ€™t work then ECT. I think the only thing left beyond ECT is deep brain stimulation. After that I donâ€™t think I can fight anymore. 

They say it gets better. And Iâ€™ve held onto that hope. But it really hasnâ€™t gotten better for me. Iâ€™m not sure it will. 

In all this time Iâ€™ve never made a serious attempt. I suppose because I feel it would be final if I went that route.

But I feel depressed most of the time like what Iâ€™m doing isnâ€™t good enough for myself but other people. I push people away. Friends, girlfriend, sometimes even family, because I feel like they donâ€™t understand life in the way that I do. Itâ€™s just weird I canâ€™t really explain it but it makes sense to me.

"So Iâ€™m looking for some practical advice on how to manage executive function disorder without using prescribed medications. 
Bit of background: I (39f) have been medically diagnosed with depression and several forms of anxiety disorders (EFD being one of them) and have been managing them for several years, but this seems to be the one thing I canâ€™t quite get a handle on. 
I have previously been on different medications for short periods of time when things got really bad and hated how they made me feel in a lot of ways both physically and psychologically. 

At work I have no issue whatsoever, itâ€™s almost like I have a separate work personality that takes over. Iâ€™m focused and hardworking, I can prioritise and time manage and even train other people how to do the same. Everyone knows me as the one whoâ€™s gets shit done. 

Itâ€™s when I get home that everything changes. I get distracted easily and lose track of time doing stupid shit like scrolling through social media or watching tv (often both at the same time). I put things off and tell myself Iâ€™ll do them later, and then that doesnâ€™t happen. Just for one example, Iâ€™ll neglect doing the dishes for two days and then order in because by that point I canâ€™t figure out where to start and the functional part of my brain gets overwhelmed and shuts down. 

So what Iâ€™m basically looking for is practical suggestions on ways I can maybe motivate myself and manage all the mundane stuff I donâ€™t really want to do but know I have to - you know, like laundry and dusting - methods, herbal remedies or supplements that anyone has had success with, maybe a meditation technique or type of physical activity or exercise. Maybe thereâ€™s an app for that, I dunno. I have no clue where to start, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m asking for help lol 

To be clear, Iâ€™m looking for things I can incorporate daily, not suggestions for therapists. Things others have found helpful that I can work on myself outside of CBT sessions that will help to reinforce it on a daily basis. Would really appreciate some suggestions",General_disorder
"I sometimes have this feeling that lasts few minutes where I feel better than others and I don't feel in low mood feeling that and also when I feel like that I don't feel like I care about others I don't feel guilty by it well this is the feeling I'm referring to 

Little bit off topic i guess but yet if I feel depressed then I will have some negative thoughts but I still won't feel like I care as much about others and watching people enjoy themselves is depressing even though I can feel happy not always for long though 

I don't really have interest for hobbies anymore I used to there are still some things I like doing but most things u haven't felt as much interest in

I sometimes don't feel like I have as much motivation to get things done but not always 

I'm also quite forgetful I literally will forget to do chores and things slip my mind this happens often maybe to often idk

"When I had my breakdown some years ago, I was put in hospital because I answered yes when the psychiatrist asked me if I heard voices. I didnâ€™t actually hear voices though, but had thoughts that were unusual for me at the time, that seemed to come from somewhere else.  Like listening to love songs and suddenly thinking with shock, that the lyrics were evil, and walking through the city and suddenly thinking it was full of sinners.  I was not a Christian and had not grown up in church, but my breakdown caused me to have lots of thoughts about the world and people that were scary and strange.  When I was in the psych ward lots of other people in there were also talking about God or the devil or angels.

"At the moment Iâ€™m just at my wits end. One of my main issues is that I fear abandonment and it absolutely destroys me when it does happen. Even the smallest cancellation of plans leaves me feeling abandoned. 

It started with my mom, who abandoned me when I was 7. I was taken away from her by police because the household was abusive and she gave up custody. 

I was abandoned by so many friends while In school. And at home, I was constantly dealing with my ever changing family. My dad was going from woman to woman and they all ended up leaving. The only constant throughout my entire life is my father, who Iâ€™ve come to realize was abusive as well. 

More recently, my ex wanted to break up with me, and my ex best friend broke things off with me while I was still living with her. 

And just today, my dad canceled plans on me yet again, my date got canceled, and I had to cut off one of my guy friends that Iâ€™d become really close to. Heâ€™d make any and every excuse not to hang out with me and I was tired of it. 

Im just so tired of this pattern. I canâ€™t trust anyone to stay in my life. I just let them leave, I donâ€™t force them to stay, but this is still driving me crazy. Iâ€™ve resorted to binge eating because I feel so empty rn.",General_disorder

"YT comments were one of the first places I started reaching out. I do a lot of posting on Twitter too, but not as much feedback on mental health stuff there. This is the start of my posting on Reddit. 
I started with social media because I didn't have any support in my day to day and the only place I could reach to was the internet. Which is a rough place when you're hanging by a thread. If you're reaching out on the internet, as hard as it can be if you have low self image, don't let that poison dilute the panacea. Take the responses that are helpful and ignore the rest.
If you want my crazy credentials, I have major depressive disorder(doing better so it may have changed) agoraphobia, unspecified anxiety disorder (aka it's too complex for them to put a neat bow on itðŸ˜‹) social anxiety, and I forget the other crap off the top of my head.
Take care and be well! I hope you find the guidance and inspiration you need to get well!
P.s. I say inspiration because healing is a very personal thing, even if a technique may be helpful to you, there's some inspiration involved in fitting it into your system. On that note, don't try to fit too much into your system at once, just add 1 new tool and make sure it works then add the next. It took me years to realize that while some of the tools I was using worked, I had mashed them all together at once and it was just a mess. So I wound up starting over from scratch, which was overall helpful. At the time though it felt like I had wasted three years of my life.

"The best advice I can give here is work on cognitive awareness. As the anxiety/depression hits try and recognize all the thoughts going on and work at finding which triggers that response. If things get fuzzy(or your too depressed to find the energy) when the anxiety/depression hits, when your mind calms a bit and you feel better try to remember what you were thinking. It can be a slow process, if it's severe it might take a year or 2 to get the hang of it(it took me about 3 years). I'd recommend looking into cognitive therapy techniques for reframing tools, or if your more spiritual, pathworking techniques.
Social Anxiety- if it happens a lot with friends, you might want to reevaluate the friendship. Not saying end things unless it's actually toxic but if your working on bettering yourself and they're content to stay they same as when you became friends the conflict within could be as simple as falling into your old patterns when around them and your mind being confused since you've been working on changing, and if it's a group it could just be one person triggering things. if thats the case and you value that group, let your friends know you need to work on yourself a bit and work on your personal boundaries so that the one person doesn't ruin the whole group for you. If they're good friends they'll still be there when you're comfortable coming back. 
Depression- So it sounds easy to say, but it's hard to do especially if it's severe and long lasting, but reframing and self image are the base of remodeling a depressed foundation. It's taken me years to get to a point where I can barely count the minutes in a month that I desire to cease existence and not the hours in a day I longed for death to take me. 
Self image technique I use: every morning and night, look into a mirror smile and tell yourself ""I love all parts of us/me"" however you want to phrase it. It was easier for me at first to refer to the mirror and myself as us. It was easier for me to express love for my reflection than to express it for myself. The smile is important also. It took me a year to stop feeling silly and like a liar, and about another year to start believing what I was saying.
Reframing technique: find one solid image that makes you feel positive, for me it was my dog. When doing something and you start to feel depressed focus on that image as strongly as your able. If the image starts to get tarnished by the depression, spend some of your ""up"" time doing that thing or with that person to strengthen the positivity of it.
Deeper reframing is really time consuming and can be difficult, and it takes a fair bit of self awareness.
Example: My agoraphobia was very bad at this point, I was managing maybe 1-2 hours a month away from the house. Mainly to get groceries once a month. The panic attack would lead into a major depressive episode. I don't have electricity, so I could only keep milk a couple days in a cooler. So the only times I drank milk for a long time was during a major depressive episode. 1 day I was having a great day, and feeling good. I also had milk on hand. So I poured a glass and was sitting with my dog and about halfway through the glass I was feeling really depressed. I couldn't figure it out, things were going well I hadn't had a panic attack why was I so down so suddenly. After probably 6-8 hours of thinking about it I realized I had made a pavlovian response linking milk to depression  mind you that wasn't my first conclusion. I thought through everything from someone drugged my milk(it was in a cooler outside so still crazy, but not as crazy as one would think), to radio waves from the nearby radio station before it occured to me I had just formed an emotional trigger between milk and my depressive episodes. I then spent probably 16 hours total going through my memory and disassociating the emotion from the act of drinking milk. I mostly did this by using positive imagery to basically counter the negative emotional state. I'm still working on a better way of explaining that process.

"Hi everyone. I'll start by saying that I don't want to romanticise mental health issues or anything like that -- and if it looks like I do, I'm sorry, that's not my intention. You are free to tell me that I'm just exaggerating things. Maybe I am - that's why I'm asking in the first place.

I have had a serious panic attack some days ago and one of my friends who helped me get through it told me I should talk to a psychologist or a psychiatrist. At first I thought it was nothing serious, but I am now trying to study a bit about mental health and I find many symptoms of social anxiety, MDD, AvDP or BDP extremely relatable. I have talked to a psychologist that my school makes available for the students freely and started crying in the middle of the session (it is very difficult for me to talk even to my closest friends). While talking I realised that many things I have always considered ""normal"" or just part of my personality have had a huge impact in my development and still cause me considerable impairment and discomfort in social life. 

However, I have never had any serious symptoms (psychotic/delusional nor suicide attempts, although I have had many suicidal thoughts throughout my life) and sometimes I happen to feel genuinely happy (I think), although I have extreme and rapid mood swings. But most of the time, I would just like not to feel anything at all. I feel like there is a thin wall of ice between me and everyone else and I just can't be comfortable unless I'm alone. But when I'm alone I feel loneliness. I'm starting to hate myself for all of this thinking.

Honestly, I don't know what to do. I have been obsessed with this for the last few days. I'm worried that I may be just exaggerating normal negative reactions to justify myself with others or to seek their attention. I found myself in the position of hoping for my psychologist to suggest a possible diagnosis -- I think that would make me feel less alone right now and may also alleviate some of this burden (I constantly blame myself for not being able to be happy and a diagnosis could finally convince me that this is none of my fault).

I'm confused. What should I do? Should I wait some time and see how it goes? Or should I take action as soon as possible? For sure, I will continue to see the school psychologist 30 mins a week. I'm less than 18 and seeking professional help would mean having to explain to my parents that I'm not ""ok"" and that panic attacks are not my main and only issue. And it's also a considerable investment in terms of time and money. If it means anything, there is high familiarity with both depressive and psychotic disorders among my first-degree relatives.

Also, when does one consider switching from a psychologist to a psychiatrist? Is it something that can be done even without severe symptoms? Does it usually follow a recommendation?

Thank you for reading and for your help. Sorry if it looks like I'm an egoistic idiot trying to capture attention. I'm just genuinely worried for myself. I want to feel better.",General_disorder

I have strong healthy boundaries that I express in healthy ways.
I am grateful that the worst moments are past.
I am grateful that every moment is better than the last.
Every moment in every way I'm better and better and better

Over the years I've added some more personal stuff, that's more specific to me. 

When I was at my worst, I started with telling myself I love you at least once a day and it was too much trouble many days. It took 6-8 months before I could do it everyday. Once I was able to do it every morning, I started doing it at night too. I found it helpful to do it in a mirror while smiling (at first it was mostly a fake smile). 
I kept a mirror by the bed, because going all the way to the bathroom to say I love you was too much effort for something I didn't yet believe.

"When I was younger, I was very sheltered. I was entirely homeschooled and not allowed to do much outside of the house. While homebound, I was abused by the primary caretaker, my uncle. Since I didn't attend school, most of what I learned about society and being around people came from TV and video games.


During puberty, my attention-seeking behavioral issues increased, and I started to act out in ways that would emotionally hurt others. Even though I knew it would hurt them, it didn't feel like it mattered, since everyone outside of me was an NPC or 'extra'.


As I aged I continued to have this problem, but I learned slowly that other people are real and have real feelings. That didn't stop my outbursts, though; only this time, after the damage was done, intense guilt always followed. (Also to note: I would sort of space out before and during these outbursts, and I'd feel this odd suspension of belief like a video game. It was only afterwards when I'd ""wake up"" and I'd realize what I'd done, I'd freak out.)


After some therapy, medication, and self-help, I've come a long way regarding boundaries, other people's emotions, the consequences of my actions, etc. But I'm haunted by my past behavior and how people felt alien to me, like unconsequential playthings.

Hi. I am a bit concerned about my brother and wanted to ask for advice because my parents are not very helpful and my sister agrees with everything they say. 

He likes weapons, plays violent games, stuff like that. He also has conservative political views, does not respect women very much, and wants to enroll in the military. I don't believe that these things make him a violent person. He is a teenager, after all. I only wanted to give you guys context. 

Yesterday, around midnight, he was messing around in our attic as he often does (he plays piano in there), and a bat started to bother him. So he caught the bat and smashed its ribcage with his bare hands until the bat died. He seemed to think it was all fine and dandy because he cleaned everything up afterward and even felt it was a bit funny. I told him that wasn't normal behavior and got very upset by the whole thing. My sister joked around as if it weren't a big deal, and my mom was more upset by me ""making a scene"" and ruining her lunch than by what my brother did. She even used the ""boys will be boys"" excuse. 

Still a little bit better than my dad, who said it didn't matter because the bat was a pest, and my brother had to kill it however he could at the time. I managed to convince my mom to talk to my brother, but only after a lot of struggle. She still thinks I was overreacting and somehow made the whole thing about how she isn't supposed to solve all of our problems because we are already old enough to take care of stuff.

"To start of this account doesnâ€™t have a lot of Karma because itâ€™s a new one. Iâ€™d like to stay anonymous. And Iâ€™ll be posting this across multiple platforms and subreddits. It took me an hour to gather my thoughts about this. I wrote this text on the 8th of march.
Iâ€™m a 16 year old guy (turning 17 in 4 months) with a Kenyan mom and a Cameroonian dad. My parents are strict when it comes to where I hang out and when. I donâ€™t have a lot of friends fr. I have one real Friend that I can meet and talk to but she lives 1 1/2 hours away by train. Im just an acquaintance to most other people. I have a few Internet friends who live far away that I talk to sometimes tho but it just isnâ€™t the sameâ€¦

The thing thatâ€™s been bothering me is that I feel lonely and disconnected from anything thatâ€™s happening in real life. I wonâ€™t feel sad or lonely unless something triggers it. Itâ€™s like everytime I remeber my situation I just start feeling bad and sometimes it gets really bad. But after a day or two Iâ€™ll feel normal again and just suck it up. Following triggered that feeling again: 
Former Classmate is turning 17 and moved to another city one year ago. To be exact cologne. It isnâ€™t going to be a huuuuuge party so no taking drugs or anything. 
10 People are coming and theyâ€™re gonna go bowling. I live 1 1/2 hours away by train so they offered to drive me there cuz another friend from my city is also going. Only problem is theyâ€™re gonna start bowling at 8pm, theyâ€™ll be done at 11:30 and I have to be home by 10PM. I usually have to be home by 8:30PM on weekends with exceptions (like this birthday). Because of my curfew I wonâ€™t be able to go there. Itâ€™s sad since this couldâ€™ve been a great opportunity to make new friends yk.

This is just an example of the type of things that trigger me. Social media does it too tho. When I see people I know being outside with their friends and stuff I just feel miserable and pathetic cuz the only thing I do when I come home is go to football practice or sit at my desk for hours forgetting to eat while making beats. I never talked to anybody about my feelings except one girl a month ago or sum. But we stopped talking so I donâ€™t feel comfortable sharing this with anyone because I feel like Iâ€™m just gonna be a burden. Especially because Iâ€™m still getting to know the person Iâ€™m talking to rn. Which is also a internet friend.

Im typing this text with tears in my eyes itâ€™s kinda hard. Even though I know that latest tomorrow evening I will have crammed this whole matter somewhere into the back of my mind.

I donâ€™t know what to do! I just feel so helpless like all of this is just going to continue until Iâ€™m eventually old enough to move out. I donâ€™t even know if my feelings are justified which might be the reason Iâ€™m not taking this so serious. Because I always keep thinking that if it was that bad I wouldnâ€™t be smiling at day or laughing with people. Iâ€™ve had a lot of thoughts about just k*lling myself but I know I donâ€™t have the balls to do it so thereâ€™s no need to worry. 
Iâ€™ve been feeling like this for a year now maybe longer but it just keeps getting worse. Itâ€™s come to a point where I feel like I donâ€™t want this to stop. Iâ€™m just bathing in self pitty rn.

Another thing thatâ€™s been bothering me for a long time is the fact that I talk to myself in my head. Itâ€™s kinda like therapy. I just feel like somebodyâ€™s listening to me and understand me yk. Itâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing rn. But this shit I driving me insane cuz I know itâ€™s important to talk to actual people so thatâ€™s the reason why Iâ€™m gonna post this. Iâ€™m gonna create a new account tho cuz I donâ€™t wann anybody irl to find out about this. It would be embarrassing af.

Anyway I think Iâ€™m done with venting so I kinda wanna hear your thoughts about this. Iâ€™m sry if I sound crazy I donâ€™t even know myself anymore.

Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m sassy complaining about not being allowed to be outside after 8 PM. Itâ€™s just my head. Itâ€™s fucking with me.

I even act different around the house. I feel like thereâ€™s a bunch of people I know watching me everyday, everysecond. When I go to  shower in the shower cabin I donâ€™t even feel comfortable anymore because I feel like thereâ€™s people watching me get naked and stuff. Or when Iâ€™m using the toilet. Or eating. Basically everything.

Yk my online friends all got a life. They got friends irl too not like me. So when theyâ€™re busy doing their things (understandable) It kinda does something with me.

The reason why Iâ€™m jumping from Point to point is because I keep remembering things I forgot.

I donâ€™t know where to start. Itâ€™s just to much.

Edit (12th March) : Today I was in a relatively good mood making breakfast until my father started yelling and complaining about me leaving my window open in my room (I forget things a lot). The things is once he points something out he just keeps going and lists everything in doing wrong. At some point it just got too much and when he was done talking I left the kitchen and went up in my room till he was done. I noticed that my hands were shaking and my breathing was inconsistent. I just started crying. I went back down when he was done and wanted to sit down at the table but when I saw my father next room I just started tearing up again so now Iâ€™m in the living room where I canâ€™t see him and Iâ€™ve been tearing up the entire time. Iâ€™m still shaking. That was 1 hour ago.",General_disorder

So Iâ€™ve been having some sort of paranoid delusions since age 11, only recently realized they started back thenâ€¦ not currently delusional to my knowledge.

i got a diagnosis (in quote marks; because itâ€™s a symptom not a disorder) psychosis NOS from a psychiatrist specialized in adolescent psychiatry (iâ€™m 17)

Anyway I am very impulsive (spending everything on dumb â– â– â– â–  when ever I have the opportunity to, aggressive sometimes etc.), feeling empty/boredom , mood swings

Another psychiatrist has suggested I have something like mania/bipolar but I donâ€™t really relate with itâ€¦

My aunt once thought I seemed similar to my schizo/bipolar cousin who was around 28 at the time (I was 13) when I had a â€meltdown/episodeâ€ of a kind (I was very out of it, hurting others and got almost ran over by a car, others were threatening me with admitting me to a ward/calling the police etc) could i have bpd",General_disorder
As anyone noticed this I can't ignore no matter how small the sound or light movement is. For example if someone is moving their pen and i can't ignore that and i will be bothered by it in class same goes for sounds and even people just changing a little movement I am tired of this. I am tired of hearing people 4 seats  away from me open or close their bag. I am tired of noticing someone moving their feet. I don't know I don't feel good and i get tired.,General_disorder

Guys I need some advice, Iâ€™m feeling really stuck in life. 

Iâ€™m in a pretty stressful financial situation. On top of this, Iâ€™m trying to manage anxiety, depression, OCD and an eating disorder as well as chronic pain. 

Picking up more shifts is difficult for a few reasons: Iâ€™m in constant pain, my body is very fatigued because of my eating disorder, work makes me stressed because of my own insecurities so I get too overwhelmed to eat which makes my mental health worse. Because I donâ€™t have a lot of money I canâ€™t afford physiotherapy and can barely afford therapy and medication. I also really need to move out of where Iâ€™m living because the conditions are pretty bad and are a huge cause of my OCD which lead to my eating disorder which is causing most of my mental health issues, but I canâ€™t afford to because everywhere else is so much more expensive. 

I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore, I feel completely stuck and feel like thereâ€™s no winning option here. Moving back to live with my parents is not an option. Iâ€™ve had to drop out of university because my mental, physical, and financial health is just too much. I applied to a few dog walking sites hoping for some extra cash but havenâ€™t gotten any work there. 

What should I do? Any advice would be amazing.

"I want to be alone literally all the time when Iâ€™m not doing something, like at work or the grocery store or school, etc. (I donâ€™t mind being around ppl then). But Iâ€™m lonely and empty deep inside and I know itâ€™s not good for my already bad mental health. Why then do I hate socializing so much and turn down every invitation even when I promise myself I will go? What do you think is my problem and what do I do? 

I wish I could just have fun and be normal. I hate what my life is but I donâ€™t actually want to do the things that I fantasize about (have a friend group, relationships, travel, go to stuff etc.) I am really embarrassed by what Iâ€™ve become. I donâ€™t even know why I feel this way. I like people but donâ€™t want to be around them. I just feel very alone and lost and dead inside. 

I do try to socialize sometimes and everyone is so nice and honestly meet tons of people would be ideal friends if I put just a little effort but every time Iâ€™m invited somewhere I canâ€™t think of anything I want to do less. I kind of hate myself for it. Iâ€™m so incredibly boring and lazy and serious and standoffish honestly.

"Thereâ€™s a few things but first, every time I cry (which is rarely) I almost immediately stop and I canâ€™t feel anything. No anxiety, no depression, no happiness. I feel like all of my emotions have literally disappeared and everything and everyone I love I donâ€™t care about anymore. It can last from a few seconds to a day but I eventually start to feel like myself again. 
     Another thing is Iâ€™m very untrusting of my friends. I mean I trust them but if (for example) they donâ€™t respond to me in a few hours I immediately get this idea that they hate me. That theyâ€™re plotting against me or planning an evil scheme or whatever. I get super sad and pity myself and then Iâ€™m suddenly Iâ€™m like â€œI donâ€™t need them, I donâ€™t need anyoneâ€ and then theyâ€™ll write back or whatever and Iâ€™m suddenly like â€œoh silly me aha Iâ€™m so impatient ahaâ€. I havenâ€™t told anyone my thoughts so no one knows. But it doesnâ€™t matter how many times I tell myself to be patient and not to be dramatic, I still always do it. Whatâ€™s worse is that I often donâ€™t respond to my friends for a few days, even a few weeks, so Iâ€™m also a hypocrite. It doesnâ€™t matter how much time I spend with them and how much they tell me they love me, when Iâ€™m in the moment I truly believe that theyâ€™re faking a friendship with me.

I can feel the separation of myself and my thoughts. I can feel my soul inside of me and I can feel the difference. I probably sound crazy but I feel it so strongly and I don't know what to do. I also think I have something called visual snow syndrome but right now it's worse than usual and when I look at anything, all that I can see is grain. I feel like I'm living inside of a staticky TV. I feel no connection to anything. I've always lacked a connection with human beings as a whole and now I lack one with my own self. I feel like I could do anything and that it just wouldn't matter. I feel so free but so trapped at the same time. My life has consequences but they wouldn't be real if I could just figure out how to break out.

"So this might sound odd but when I'm outside and only when I'm outside I feel like I'm being watched and have to look about fairly often because of it, and if I don't I get really uncomfortable like pulling my hair out more often than usual, just feeling tense, almost unable to move although I obviously can i just don't know how to explain it accurately.

I've noticed this isn't as bad at night time but it is still very bad and so when I need to do anything outside I do it at night bc it is less stressful.

I dont know if this has any effect but around the time I was sent to my cmht one time I was running home because I felt like I was being followed and was crying at the same time, this part to me is still really embarrassing and I try to pretend it never happened.

I'm a 13 going on 14 I'm not even sure if how I would feel if I were to hurt someone which I don't want to nor have a urge but if I did idk if I'd feel anything from it 


I used to not lie as much now I keep lying to my mom about things not I never lied years ago just not as often who knows maybe what I'm saying is not actuate 


I had intrusive thoughts to harm others but they disappeared again because this has happened where there present for months and leave for months and cone back but who cares if they come back because who knows maybe it will teach me to care because I felt anxious by them and wasn't happy with myself thinking about that stuff and sometimes tried to push them away and probably ruimnated on them for like hour 


And more about my mental health at 11 I started to feel depressed for like every day but I would most days have moment of being happy but not always that long then back to that mental state again and had some negative thoughts and eventually lost interest in hobbies there was a hobby I was interested in but never got to try it

 and later on towards the end of 2021 I wasn't as depressed but still didn't have interest in hobbies and still negative thoughts still sometimes didn't have much motivation and lost interest in the hobby I wanted to try still don't have interest for it still sometimes had some depressed moments not as many but still could feel happy 


And few days ago I started to feel depressed again once again still don't have interest in hobbies still can feel happy and sometimes don't have much motivation but still can have motivation to complete things still have some negative thought but I sometimes tell them to shut up or I just let them bother me 

I was years ago by psychologist diagnosed with autism but I don't really think I quite relate with the symptoms of autism but I'm not to well educated on it so maybe there is something I'm missing because I kinda have holes in my memory 

And I am quite forgetful like I literally forget to do chores often 

I guess if you gave questions about this you can ask 


I don't have a therapist I didn't really explain much to my parents about my mental health my dad offered me to get help from a professional but who knows my mental health signs are just part of being a teenager

"Hello. I'm 18 years old and I've had this problem since I was, like, 15: 

&amp;#x200B;

So, when I'm completely alone, I do this weird thing: I stress my muscles really hard and try to shake/vibrate my body; I try to keep a ""rhythm"". Also, I do something similar to coughing but not quite coughing, it's more like clearing my throat intentionally in a certain rhythm, or something. I also make weird noises in the same period. I don't stop until it feels ""right"". After all is done, I put my hand on my chest to feel my heartbeat, and it's almost always beating like crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, it's almost completely intentional. I obviously don't do this in public (it's creepy as hell) and I only do it once I scanned the room for any cameras/monitoring devices. I do it randomly but mostly when I'm in an emotional state (especially when I'm angry or excited). I do it because I feel like I *need* to do it, and that I won't settle until I do it.

&amp;#x200B;

So uh, the question here is: What the fuck is wrong with me? I tried googling but, heck, where do you even start to describe this weird shit? As far as my research went, it's not a nervous system issue since I have control over it; I figured that it probably has something to do with my mental health, or anything related to that.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to tell my family about it but I didn't, and that's because I thought they'd tell me something like: ""What? you're not mentally ill!"" or ""You're not crazy!"", and since they're pretty religious, ""Maybe you should ask for God's guidance. It could be a demon, or something.""

I went to a doctor a while ago (it was a routine visit but I thought I'd mention this). So I described the thing. I don't remember exactly what our conversation was but we concluded that it was a vitamin D deficiency thing.

"This is gonna sound crazy, probably. But Iâ€™m a content creator in a rather huge fandom. I write fan fiction (a hobby that really does help me when Iâ€™m having a bad time) I also have a decent amount of Twitter followers on the account connected to all my fics.

I had an account on this anonymous messaging app called CuriousCat, eventually I started to get a lot of hate, over posts, what i write, etc.

And it become kind of a toxic habit, I would obsessively check the inbox, and almost eagerly await the next horrible message so that I could reply to it.

Eventually with the support of a few friends, I deleted the app and my account on said app, all together, and the hate has since stopped. Besides a few of my friends within the fandom getting hate messages about me.

But the thing isâ€¦ I kind of.. miss the attention? even though it was incredibly negative and sometimes accusing me of things I hadnâ€™t done.
Even though sometimes the hate, would be hurtful and horrible.

"I donâ€™t understand what Iâ€™m feeling. I almost always have a deep feeling of loneliness, unlike others Iâ€™m not ignorant to the brutal nature of humans, they give you all that affection and attention simply to get something back, and if they donâ€™t get it they leave. None of them will love, they all use, their love is never unconditional, and Iâ€™ll always be alone In this sense. 

I have people who love me, no doubt, but they rarely show or say this directly, nor do they offer support although they have recognised by increasingly antisocial behaviour. I have become unreactive, I often find myself daydreaming about practically nothing, Iâ€™m never particularly sad as there is nothing to be sad about, just I feel as if this realisation of what has always been there has meant I have a lost a part of myself. But that same person comes back in the gym, when drinking with friends, or even alone. Then Iâ€™m focused, or careless, nothing matters, reality doesnâ€™t apply. Itâ€™s probably the only thing keeping me going. 

The world around me almost puts me in a third person perspective. Itâ€™s like confusion but I understand whatâ€™s happening. They way people play along with the flirting that gets them nowhere, the way people are angered by the simplest of words. People are so naive. I cannot comprehend why they care for such things. I cannot comprehend myself. Some days Iâ€™m normal, and increasing amount of others I am not. I block myself out from things thatâ€™ll likely hurt me, other times I donâ€™t, but I can never distinguish which is the right choice. Some days when I am not I want to feel like shit, I want love, I want attention. But the days I am I just want to be left alone, people point it out and I wish they didnâ€™t. I wish they didnâ€™t exist on those days. I cannot even begin to try and guess what the fuck is wrong with me.",General_disorder

Hi everyone! 

A classmate and I are interested in determining whether or not the public believes those diagnosed with mental health disorders can accurately recall critical events from the past to further predict the innocence or guilt of another human being in criminal court. By taking our survey, you will anonymously allow us to determine the community's perception regarding those mentally diagnosed, their accuracy levels, and the importance of reliably testifying as an eyewitness in court. We appreciate your participation and look forward to reviewing our results.

"I donâ€™t understand, why I had to pull the short stick in this world and have such a difficult burden put into my head when everyone else is living life with normal problems, not having to worry about having delusionsâ€¦ or outlandish thoughts swarm my psyche and force me to walk around like a 2 ton boulder on top of my head",General_disorder
"So I have performance based anxiety. And it's pretty severe. I've got a lot of triggers but I'm working through them. This is one of the bigger ones and there's a lot of moving parts to this. It's gonna be a bit of a read...but any and all help would be appreciated if you can get through reading this post lol. (Apologies in advance.)

So about my performance anxiety surrounding job searching...I've been fired and/or let go from every job that I've had because I've tried to do things a better way. (Often, it's a different way because I have ADHD and I work differently and my bosses don't like it. They don't like me reinventing or tweaking the work process even though it harms no one or that I'm showing them up.) It feels like I'm fucking up when I get let go, naturally. But now whenever I go job searching I get bad panic attacks or just flat out freeze in front of the computer screen. I can't even get to finishing applications. Which, to my brain, feels like another failure, feeding the anxiety. 

(Sidenote: I know I'm logically not screwing up that badly because I talk to my former co-workers. People love me and those who work underneath me always tell me I did a good job, that they were sad when I left, that I often went above and beyond what was asked of me and that sh*t hits the fan whenever I go. Always the same pattern. I just have shit luck with awful bosses lol and it's still hard to shake that feeling of failure.)

I didn't finish college or university so that's an added anxiety on top of it all. It's harder to find a job without  those qualifications even though I've got a lot of experience...but it brings back those feelings of regret and failure for dropping out even though it was probably the right thing to do for my mental health. Feeds the anxiety. 

On top of all this, I feel like I'm letting my partner down even though they constantly reassure me they'll stand by my side. It's been a few months of me being stuck. They make enough money to support us and I just got my employment insurance come through, so that helps. But still, the idea I'm letting them down...it's hard to disarm that. Feeds the anxiety.

And throughout ALL of that, I'm constantly fighting my ADHD brain. There are several days when I feel bad or awful and I procrastinate because my ADHD brain just checks out mentally, even with my meds. And then I wind up on the couch or just doing house chores. And then I feel bad because I know I got some life stuff done but not what I really need to get done. I.e. I'm not managing my ADHD well. Feeds the anxiety. Which feeds the ADHD (because I've come to learn that anxiety tends to make my symptoms more frequent and worse and the urge to do something less stressful becomes stupidly strong and I end up giving in). Which feeds the anxiety because I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing. It's a vicious cycle.

I've tried a lot of CBT and DBT techniques. They all help a bit. But not enough to get over the hurdle. I can't possibly be the only person who's felt like a bum in this way, so I'm genuinely curious how people have gotten over this sort of thing.",General_disorder

I'm a 13 going on 14 I'm not even sure if how I would feel if I were to hurt someone which I don't want to nor have a urge but if I did idk if I'd feel anything from it 


I used to not lie as much now I keep lying to my mom about things not I never lied years ago just not as often who knows maybe what I'm saying is not actuate 


I had intrusive thoughts to harm others but they disappeared again because this has happened where there present for months and leave for months and cone back but who cares if they come back because who knows maybe it will teach me to care because I felt anxious by them and wasn't happy with myself thinking about that stuff and sometimes tried to push them away and probably ruimnated on them for like hour 


And more about my mental health at 11 I started to feel depressed for like every day but I would most days have moment of being happy but not always that long then back to that mental state again and had some negative thoughts and eventually lost interest in hobbies there was a hobby I was interested in but never got to try it

 and later on towards the end of 2021 I wasn't as depressed but still didn't have interest in hobbies and still negative thoughts still sometimes didn't have much motivation and lost interest in the hobby I wanted to try still don't have interest for it still sometimes had some depressed moments not as many but still could feel happy 


And few days ago I started to feel depressed again once again still don't have interest in hobbies still can feel happy and sometimes don't have much motivation but still can have motivation to complete things still have some negative thought but I sometimes tell them to shut up or I just let them bother me 

I was years ago by psychologist diagnosed with autism but I don't really think I quite relate with the symptoms of autism but I'm not to well educated on it so maybe there is something I'm missing because I kinda have holes in my memory 

And I am quite forgetful like I literally forget to do chores often 

I guess if you gave questions about this you can ask 


I don't have a therapist I didn't really explain much to my parents about my mental health my dad offered me to get help from a professional but who knows my mental health signs are just part of being a teenager 

Unless this is something with environment  I'm in online school temporarily I don't really hang out with toxic friends or things like that 

Idk if these things have to do with it just my case my mental health shouldn't be a excuse",General_disorder

"Hello, wanna clarify that I'm not asking for a diagnosis but just some insight. I've had different obsessive habits since childhood. At first I was just biting my nails then stopped after a few months and my mom said its just one of those things kids make a habit of then stop. But then I got another habit of playing with my lower lip, that continued for a long while then I stopped it and got into cracking my fingers constantly, then stopped after a few years and started pulling my hair etc etc. 

Basically since I was a kid Ive always had one obsessive behaviour like this or another nonstop, everytime I get rid of one of these habits I start another one. I've tried stopping multiple times and I resist the urge for a week or two maximum then start doing it again.

Do you know anyone that does this? I havent seen or heard of it. Not sure what its called either so I could research more into it and stop.",General_disorder
"Hello everybody.

Please dont laugh or disrespect as I know this is very stupid but it has destroyed my life.

I want to share my story for the past few years which I know to some is just something that they wont care about, but I've come to a point where I've had enough . The topic is something I cant disclose to family as it is a matter related to religion. I am very ashamed of this but because this is anonymous I thought I'd share.

It started on the night of an exam where I was so stressed I could not fall asleep at all. During the following day? I was so tired and drowsy due to the fact I hadnt slept at all. This developed into a phobia where I was stressed I wont fall asleep and due to the stress this happened . Because I wanted so hard to fall asleep to do well in exams , I couldn't sleep at night. After exams finished this experience alleviated but again returned when I had to start my college. My brain brought this trauma back everytime I knew I need full attention and energy. Because i wanted to do well in studies , my brain brought the thought that if i cant sleep i cant do well and i will fail in all aspects of my life. 
To combat this I developed an approach where I would convince I will die if I sleep , and this helpt me sleep at night. This was a repeating cycle every day. I had to convince myself I would die that night , and I was so convinced that I could no longer plan for the future, for example meeting friends. 

This went along until I spoke to my parents about this. Speaking about this helped, but yet I was always bombarded by thoughts that I cant sleep at night. 

As I tried combatting this, one day I my father who is very religious spoke about a quranic verse which is along the lines of : ""god takes away the soul at night during sleep "" .  The way my brain interpreted this was that god controls my sleep (CAN YOU IMAGINE), and so my sleep is in his hands. This was worsened when I came across a quote from the islamic prophet that stated god took your souls as he willed and returned them as he willed in the context of his companions who described their sleep at a particular time. 
At this time I was horriefied: this thought that god controls my sleep and so I cant sleep unless he willed was brought about due to myself being very religious and also due to this mental condition alone. 
Because I kept searching about these things i came across a verse in the psalms which says ""god gives sleep to those whom he likes"". 

Due to me being religious and also Islamic teachings which state god is in control of everything , I felt hopeless. The only way I could combat this was to refute islam and the psalms , to convince my self these arent divine , and so no external force can control my sleep. So all of this just to be able to sleep at night. To do this I would look for errors in these scriptures to satisfy my ""atheism"". 

However my brain combatted this approach by trying to prove these scriptures are divine , and so god is in control of my sleep just to stop me from sleeping. For example it would make me search for scientfic miracles in the quran just so I accept islam and so the same thought that god controls my sleep comes back. This would occur on a daily basis , and has been happening for the past 2 years , making my life like hell. I had to refute claims made by my own mind  which tried to say islam is divine just to be able to sleep at night.

These thoughts could come during the night meaning I would have to look for reputations in the middle of the night.
This is why I cant disclose this to my family as if they find out I exited the religion , they would be extremely angry and you know what happens if someone leaves islam.


As an extra point, I have been taking medication for years mainly celexa which did help in reducing these thoughts but the effect went away which is why I'm at this point now. 

Today for example , my mother described a dream she had which is a reflection of something described in islam , but she had never heard about before. This has obviously prompted the thought that islam is divine and true, and so the same though has come back again that god is in control of my sleep and unless he wills I cant sleep at any time. 

I hope this makes sense. Yes I know you may laugh as this sounds ridiculous, but it has completely destroyed my life. I've not been able to socialise properly and sleep has always been in the back of my head. The part where religion came in made it 10 times worse. I've had to fight myself every day just to be able to sleep at night. 

I dont know what to do anymore. I think this will stick with me for the rest of my life. I dont think I could get married as nobody would want to live with a maniac with such a mental condition .

I have had suicidal thoughts many and many times and what makes it worse I cant tell anyone.  All I hope is I die soon, as this is the best option

All I wish is if somebody could help me or miraculously remove this experience from me ðŸ˜ª

"I have been having paranoid thoughts (for a year now) that my father is SA me every night in my sleep. I often get unwanted ideas (or intrusive thoughts) about ""it"" during the day that make my body tremble/shiver, and somehow cannot stop it. I feel really uncomfortable around him. 

Any ideas why/Advice?",General_disorder
I'm always telling myself things are so much worse than they are. If someone who I have an interest in doesn't talk to me for a few days then I tell myself that they hate me and never want to speak to me again and that they have completely lost interest in me. This leads me to ask them if they still like me and I often end up making myself look crazy. If my friends are busy with something and can't talk to me then I tell myself that they aren't my friends and that they're all sick of me. If someone leaves my messages on read then I breakdown. I know it's irrational but my thoughts spiral so quickly and I can't stop them. My brain tells me to leave people before they've even done anything wrong but I stay anyway and put myself through so much pain. I'm causing all of the pain by myself. I cry over this so often and then I don't want to leave my bed anymore or do anything. Sometimes it's like I mentally put myself through breakups before I was ever even in the relationship(and this applies to friendships too). It gets really hard not to hurt myself whenever I feel all of these things because my sadness is just too overwhelming to deal with. I feel so guilty for being like this and I feel like I don't deserve to be treated well by anyone.,General_disorder
"So ive recently moved to a new town and in our new neighbourhood theres this 10 year old girl, I thought she was 13-14 at first and so did my parents and grandparents she just looks and talks like shes older, anyway the day we move to the new house she comes up and knocks to give us a halloween party invitation. At this point i thought of her as a ghost kind of like I didnt really acknolage her because I didnt know her very well. At the party we get to talking and turns out shes interesting and fun to talk to. For the past 4-5 months ive been going to her house at least twice a week since she has a little brother that likes to play with my 2 little brothers and Im in charge of watching them. Ive noticed I think about her more everyday and on the days when I dont see her I get depression that lasts until the next time I see her, the days I see her I feel fine and enjoy life. Also I need to add I never think about her sexually as I just cant shes beautiful but not in that way I love her looks and personality but I dont get turned on or anything.

"I have been feeling like this for 3 years now. My anxiety goes through the roof. I guess Iâ€™ll try to make it make sense. Letâ€™s say, if I watch a Minecraft video. I know it sounds stupid. My brain will try to trick me and make me feel like an antisocial 12 year old who worships Minecraft videos who cannot socialize at all and that tickling thought brings me so much anxiety that my hands start to sweat, it gets hard to think and watching any YouTube video becomes absolute hell. This generalization goes over everything. If I watch a video about maps or chess or anything. To fix these thoughts that give me anxiety I have to delete the videos in my history. No problem. Then this weird mental disease messes with me by the people who I talk with. I know this sounds weird, but if I talk to an introvert my mind messes me with me again and says I can never be comfortable talking to anybody ever again and then it becomes true. I genuinely cannot become comfortable talking to become unless I stop talking to THAT person. But generally speaking the people I want to become friends with(the ones that donâ€™t induce intrusive thoughts) are rude and disrespectful.

"I have OCD, a tasteful dose of autism, newly acquired PTSD and apparently GAD. Top it off with the usual dose of ADHD and you have what I like to think of as an endless pool of suffering. Let me explain. The OCD causes me to constantly think back to a panic attack I had while driving (PTSD from experience). Which causes a compulsion too distract myself. Usually it's video games or something easy... Like reading stuff on Reddit... Porn, drugs.
Anyway add the dose of autism to make it so that it's near impossible for me to ask for help or make friends. I have a hard time expressing these troubles I rarely do. The GAD was my most recent diagnosis. It's been 3 years since that accident and since I still haven't worked or even really gone outside... I know yikes... I don't go to therapy. With my issues I grew up in therapy. I was troubled youth for obvious reasons. After a certain amount of therapy you start to hear the same things. I had over ten years of therapy before I was 20.

"BPD, ASD, ADHD, C-PTSD, depression, social anxiety, generalised anxiety. What the fuck.

I feel like I've tried every route. Socialising, meditation, working out, therapist, psychologist, specialized psychologist, SSRIs, SNRI, a cocktail of narcotics, sleeping, eating healthy, positive attitude, finding occupation to fill free time with.

What I've come out with in the end: Gambling addiction, &gt;!suicidal ideations!&lt;, drug addiction (although 4 weeks sober as of now, mostly due to being broke), broken relationships with family or I mean they were broken before but now they're extremely broken. Hurt friends by ghosting or telling them to fuck off during bipolar episodes, so no friends as of now,&gt;!self harm tendencies,!&lt; and quite a bit of debt to family (1000eur) after failed attempts at studying. I've never borrowed money for drugs.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't get proper help or treatment either as the queues to meet these professionals are insanely long in my country. We've got socialized healthcare so literally anyone can be put in the queue for free and of course people just go ahead.

I've yet to be diagnosed with BPD, C-PTSD, or ADHD but my psychologist, and a specialized psychologist, and a psychiatrist, have all went through the DSM-5 for all of those with me and is sure that I should be diagnosed ASAP as I'm struggling so much I can't even work or study (I've failed studies since middleschool due to ADHD, ASD, and BPD). BUT THE FUCKING QUEUES STOP ME FROM GETTING DIAGNOSED AND THEN THE PROPER TREATMENT. All of the disorders above are prominent in the male side of my family too. I should be able to even get specialized housing because of my ADHD and ASD and allowance from the government (about 80eur a week, I wouldn't have to pay rent) BUT I CANT BECAUSE OF THE QUEUES.

"So, Iâ€™ve (38M) been diagnosed with ADHD, bipolar 2, general anxiety, and dependent personality disorder. Iâ€™ve done therapy and meds (currently on two mood stabilizers and Adderall), but nothing helps.

Most of my problems revolve around work. Not my specific job, but just in general; Iâ€™m depressed when Iâ€™m unemployed because of the societal and familial pressure to work and look for a job, and the lack of money. Iâ€™m even more depressed when Iâ€™m employed because I just hate work so much. I feel like I have no say in my own life and am at somebody elseâ€™s whim. Also because I have to stop what Iâ€™m doing and go somewhere I donâ€™t want to go. Iâ€™m just in a constant state of dread. 

Anyway, maybe this just comes from the fact that I grew up well off and my parents never made me work in my formative years, so I just got used to it, so I didnâ€™t have the habit of working. Maybe Iâ€™m just a spoiled rich kid (not super rich, but upper middle class; dadâ€™s a dentist). Maybe this is what made me hate work and also made me so dependent. Iâ€™ve never, and still am not fully financially independent, and I have lived with my parents and been unemployed more often than not in my adult life (I live with my parents now, but am employed.). I just hate my life so much, and it all has to do with work. At least the majority of it. (Another problem is my inability to maintain, and at this point, even get, a romantic relationship. Iâ€™ve always been codependent in relationships. Again, comes from the dependent disorder.)

Maybe Iâ€™m just one of those lazy millennials the boomers always talk about. I mean, I have a job and am good at it; I work hard, but I hate it with every fiber of my being.  All I know is I canâ€™t keep living like this. I donâ€™t want this workaday life where I wake up, go to work, get off, fuck around until I get tired, remain isolated (working nights makes this worse) rinse repeat for the rest of my life. I CANT live forever like this, but am too mentally and physically exhausted to do anything about it. 


Basically, I just feel like if I didnâ€™t have to work but still had money I wouldnâ€™t be nearly as depressed, so itâ€™s not really mental illness; itâ€™s just laziness stemming from never having to work and having no responsibilities for so long while my brain was still developing. I donâ€™t know what to do. Rather, I have a good idea what to do, I just canâ€™t do it because Iâ€™ve been trained to be lazy. Sorry itâ€™s so long.

"I have been struggling with OCD and Schizophrenia since the start of last year (2021) when I got my first official diagnosis,before that I had  other delusions that resembled OCD for example I thought that I was the antichrist and had a marking on my forehead and that everyone but me could see it hence why they stared at me for long periods of time,obviously that wasn't the case but amazingly I somehow outgrew this delusion.

Come March 2021,The OCD came back in it's strongest form it came as a mix of both Harm and  Religious OCD,It led me to believe that I would cause the people evil eye or bad luck/injury if I felt jealous or looked at them without saying a certain prayer.This in turn led me to isolate in my house for six months fearing I might cause people harm if I went outside.

The reason this is causing so much problems is:

A)I would consider myself a good person but these thoughts make me think I am an evil person because if I was actually a good person I wouldn't have got these thoughts.

B)It has led me to ruminate about people in my head especially family members(e.g An evil thought comes in my head then I have to say the prayer and the process just repeats often accompanied with chest tightness,anxiety and feelings of distress).

C)I want to kill myself because it seems the only way the pain will go away and the thoughts will stop.

D)This delusion is self sustaining,what i mean by this is it is easy to debunk other delusions by logic but this delusion's effects seem real,for example people complaining about how their back or leg hurts or about any problems they may have triggers me to believe that I might have caused due to the Harm OCD.

However, I've been told I have Bipolar Disorder as well and Generalized Anxiety, and at previous places I had been officially diagnosed with those things(I believe). I just feel weird saying I have those two things if I'm not currently diagnosed at my current doctor, ya know? Do you guys think I should try to get documents from the previous places I've been to see what all my official diagnosis's are?  


I don't know if this is the appropriate place to post this, but I'm just like idk. Like I know what I struggle with and a lot of people say like you don't have to worry about official diagnosis's, however it's hard in today's climate to not have an official diagnosis on hand when people are fake claiming people left and right. It just worries me. Also it's validating to be officially diagnosed with something you struggle with and that you know you struggle with. Like I only recently have been diagnosed with ADHD and I feel a lot better now that I'm officially diagnosed. It makes me feel validated. I just don't want to go around telling people I have something I might not be officially diagnosed with.

I'm so sick of life. I've been having problems with both my mental and physical health and it's breaking me. It's been going on for almost three weeks and it's making me feel worse and worse and I've never wanted to give up more. Nothing feels worth fighting for. I have things to live for and I have huge dreams I wish to accomplish but I feel like I'll never be able to. I just want to give up. I don't want to fight anymore. I just want to die.

"Gonna keep it brief. I hate listing diagnoses and all that, it makes me feel like Iâ€™m discounting my abilities as a person, but it would probably help understand where Iâ€™m coming from. Got adhd, generalized anxiety, major depression and although Iâ€™m adopted, my birth father is schizophrenic and my birth mother is bipolar. They are both dysfunctional addicts.  

I believe in the past I have gone through more than one bout of psychosis, the worst after starving myself on amphetamines and losing 70 pounds in like three months. Eating still disordered, not as bad. Have told no one about the psychosis part, and this has been years now. 

Iâ€™ve slowly realized how different my thought process is than everyone else I interact with. Never really connected with someone on such a deep interpersonal level that I myself felt completely understood, but Iâ€™ve made amazing friendships with amazing people and I canâ€™t blame anyone for not getting me completely, they arenâ€™t me and I donâ€™t even understand myself most of the time. 

For example, I can be in a completely withdrawn, extremely scary mood where I just want to die and it seems like I just canâ€™t move on (Have quite literally looked down the barrel). Then I see a pizza on the counter and go, ooh, that looks good. Forgetting I just spent eight hours writhing around in my bed with physically painful thoughts. This is obviously not the only issue I have, but it helps paint a picture of how I go about my day. 

Is this just the nature of life? Distractions at every moment to keep the â€œdemonsâ€ at bay? Or do I really need clinical help? I feel like I should already know the answer,  but it truly confuses me. 

TL;DR 
Is going from seven hours of planning my death to â€œoh this pizza is fantasticâ€ at literally THE SNAP OF A FINGER, often, something I can really do anything about? Or am I doomed be it by the nature of life or genetically to be like this?",General_disorder

"I don't need answers I just need to vent.

Today has been a very shitty day, and I've been on the verge of breaking all day. My break down was starting and I was sobbing as per the usual. Then all of the sudden I hear the blinds in my kitchen (bedroom door leads to kitchen) tap against the window. No problem, sometimes that happens when my dad forgets to close the blinds and he wakes up and walks by and closes them. But then I hear something knock over. I heard chewing earlier so I assumed a mouse probably chewed all the way through and knocked something small over upon entrance, but here's the real kicker. All of the sudden I hear a pill bottle being shaken. Multiple times. At this point I'm horrified. My mom is at work, my dad is perssumed to be asleep as I heard him brush his teeth to which he does straight before going to bed and I have no pets or siblings. So I'm the only one who's 100% awake. 

I was thinking about it and explaining what happened while frantically texting my parents and then I realized that it could've been a hallucination with the amount of stress I've been in today. I was seeing a smokey haze both at school and at my house when I was thinking about the stress point and it's not the first time I've seen this during a low point and ever since I questioned if it was a hallucination the noises have stopped and honestly I'm just confused. 

My mom gets off of work in 5 minutes, and will be home soon. I haven't heard any noises in a good 30 minutes so I think I can hold on until then.

This happened like a year ago and I still havenâ€™t gotten any insight on it. At the time I was taking a low dose of seroquel at bedtime for my insomnia to help me sleep. One night I took it before bed as usual and went to sleep. The next thing I knew I was standing in my kitchen swallowing and choking on all of the seroquel from the bottle. Once I realized what I was doing I had throw up most of itâ€¦.I thought. I went back to sleep. Woke in in the morning so drowsy and out of it that I got ready for work and didnâ€™t even see all the pills and the mess I had made in the kitchen. I told my boss I wasnâ€™t feeling good and went home to see everything and suddenly remembered what happened. I donâ€™t take that medicine anymore.

"I have nobody to talk to so Iâ€™m posting this here. Iâ€™ve had a hard time since my childhoodâ€¦ I was beaten and constantly moved around. I was born with Pectus carinatum (pigeon chest), and itâ€™s always been a big insecurity of mine and gotten in the way of things. I blame it for being the root cause of most of my issues in life such as my awkwardness, self doubt, and inability to be quick/witty/funny. I donâ€™t really have a love for anything and feel like I was meant to just suffer until I die. No matter how many personality tests I take or how many things I try, I canâ€™t think of a career or anything I would enjoy. Because of this I still havenâ€™t gone to college. Iâ€™m approaching my mid 20s and feel like time is running out.

I hold two badass jobs, but  nobody really likes me at either of them. I can tell my boss has a general dislike of me, and would prefer to fire me but he canâ€™t because itâ€™s the military (reserves). Iâ€™m on temporary full time orders there currently, and keep fucking up by coming in late because I oversleep a lot. Had a stern talking to today and he made it a point that if it happens again heâ€™ll cut my orders and Iâ€™ll be a reservist for the rest of my enlistment. In other words, Iâ€™m blowing a great career option out of the window if it happens again. Most people there donâ€™t like me because I hardly know jack shit when it comes to how to do my job. Itâ€™s a somewhat complicated job. Even if you donâ€™t know jack shit, people there succeed off of self confidence which is impossible for me to have. My other job is a self owned business (sort of, not reallyâ€¦. I run it with my father). I have to play salesman. Iâ€™m ok at it but itâ€™s draining, especially when I get turned down. It isnâ€™t a career option either, just something weâ€™re going to sell eventually.

If I was liked, someone out of the shit ton of people I know would probably hit me up every once in a while, but it never happens. I would love to have a girlfriend, but Iâ€™ve never had one and that doesnâ€™t aid to the social skills it seems you need to get one. Im not unattractive, just the opposite of flirty, and prefer to stfu and sit in silence. My lifelong goal is a roof over my head and a wife I can come home to every day.

"Hello. I come to you asking for advice about a particular big problem I am having lately. I am diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, paranoid personality disorder and dependency disorder. Also I think I am showing signs of ADHD and bipolar disorder but I do not know for sure because I avoid therapy.

I am 20 of age, I have a girlfriend and I love drugs and life. I used anything that I could get my hands on but not in a mindless manner, only used for fun except weed, which I smoke daily for 2 years.

I am really struggling with my paranoia, I canâ€™t trust fully any person on this planet, not even my girlfriend or my family, itâ€™s like wired in my brain that everyone is out there to hurt me. In the past months I lost control over myself more and more, but mostly when I am with my girl. I canâ€™t control what I say half the times and rarely I canâ€™t control my reactions, I get angry extremely quickly out of dumb reasons, I am hurt by so small things she does that actually mean nothing, after feeling that she hurt me, I lose myself and I think at those times a manic episode starts. I do not hit her, I just talk shit and I am visibly agitated.

I am starting to let go of hope, I am starting to acknowledge that I am a crazy foul, an uncontrollable person that doesnâ€™t know what he wants. Thatâ€™s is because I am very undecided in everything, I say I love her then I donâ€™t feel any love, by the contrary I feel hate, then love comes back and this pattern happens in every aspect of my life, maybe because I might be bipolar too?

I do not want to let myself go down like that or lose this girl that understands me how I am and loves me like that, I want to stop hurting her and I keep trying but it seems I just canâ€™t control it. She told me today to go at a psychiatric to get treatment, meaning doping me with pills which I will love, because I was on some treatment about 2 years ago, I lost myself and started abusing the sleeping pills. Everything I do seems to be wrong, my life is so beautiful and I am living it to the fullest extent but I just cannot see it like that. I see everything like a living hell.

I also think that it means something special that an Illuminati member and I have the same birthday and that the symbol of the University of Helsinki related to Freemasonry etc. and my thoughts on studying there sometime in the future would be related in the way that I am supposed to become a Mason.

My other thoughts are that I get cyanide / poison gas / carbon monoxide poisoning and once even that my parents intentionally kill me for carbon monoxide poisoning. Anxiety about this has often grown so great that I have not been able to sleep or be at home. However, I realize that others do not experience things the same way or believe them to be true.

Throwaway account for anonymitys sake.

So tonight my brother in law (26M) had what i believe may have been a psychotic episode? Looking for some insight as i am not too knowledgeable in mental health, but would like to provide support if possible
. I was not there when this occurred so im going off what my S/O told me.

So my S/O and him were visiting and suddenly he got really paranoid and began freaking out and raising his voice about hearing voices all around him and he ran to the couch, grabbed a blanket to cover himself in and he started looking out the windows in a panick, he then took her phone and covered it in aluminum foil and was trying to stop her from leaving by blocking the door with his body while he was making weird movements with his tongue sticking out of his mouth. This went for around 10 minutes total. He then snapped completely out of it and didnt have any memory of any of it, or anything being abnormal.

He had smoked a half of a joint (legal canadian dispensary weed so nothing laced) but has a fairly high tolerance and it never effects him in that way.
He was also behaving slightly different all day apparently, nothing dramatic but a little distant/ removed if that makes sense.
Their father is diagnosed with schizophrenia, so that was my S/O's immediate concern.  But he hasn't displayed any  behaviours like this in the past.

Like i said, i know very little of schizophrenia or related mental health disorders. So i was hoping for some input or perhaps advice?

iâ€™ve had anxiety my whole life depression for most of my teens and adult years. i need to be clinically diagnosed but my symptoms line up perfectly with borderline personality disorder as well. since childhood i have lived with trauma and a fucked up family life that led to a warped reality and view of life relationships friendship etc. i can confidently say that people do not give a fuck about mentally ill people and all the shit they say it post about it doesnâ€™t translate to real life decisions. iâ€™ve been ostracized and treated as a weirdo or different my whole life all because iâ€™m different all over some shit i couldnâ€™t control and thatâ€™s in my genetic code. iâ€™m sick of living with this shit because everyone who supports the mentally is a fraud when it comes to doing that shit in day by day life all they give is weird looks and shit advice and all they want to do is leave you as soon as you open up to them because they know youâ€™re vulnerable and will blame yourself,General_disorder
"I'm a male in my mid 20s living in Ontario, Canada, working full time. I knew that my behavior was off and that there was something off, but I always thought that was because of my insecurities. I recently started watching some of Dr. Grande's YouTube videos about famous cases and dissecting the mental health of the people involved. The more that I dug in, the more I realized that I have some form of autism or at least anti social personality disorder combined with narcissistic disorder. 

I don't really have any friends. Just a few people from school that I see maybe a couple times a year. Sometimes weeks or even months will go by without us communicating. I have never really had a good relationship with my family, mostly because of my behavior and lack of empathy. I'm addicted to video games and the internet. I am working at the moment and I can sense that my coworkers pick up on my antisocial behavior and some choose to go out of their way to avoid me. I think this is something that might result in me losing this job and potentially ruin my career. I will be the first to be replaced as soon as they find someone better.

I'm in a very bad place mentally, all my behaviors and actions make sense now. I have always been told that I'm intelligent and that I have a bright future, but now I'm realizing that my life is going nowhere and me not doing something to fix my behavior/mental illness is the cause. I always had trouble communicating, but I always thought that was due to me being hyper. I'm realizing that my symptoms align exactly with what Dr Grande describes.

I really want to get better and live a normal life. The biggest reason I want to do this is to rekindle the relationship with my family. Sometimes I feel like I don't even know my parents that well because I never valued our relationship. I know that I need mental help, but I'm not sure where to start. Also, I'm really scared of the mental help sessions appearing on my background records somehow and ruining my chances at future employments. Regardless, I know that I cannot prolong this any further, any advice is appreciated.

"I've been on mirtazapine before, but I stopped all psychiatric medications besides stimulants and benzodiazepines because I found they had a lot less side effects and were way more effective than other medications, but I decided to ask my psychiatrist about things I can take everyday for anxiety, sleep, and agitation. Basically all the antipsychotics I've taken haven't been good, and I've tried almost all of them, so for mood my doctor mentioned lamotrigine or sodium valproate, but I was worried about weight gain on sodium valproate. I've been on mirtazapine before and found it moderately helpful for sleep, so I figured I'd try that instead of being awake for multiple days until I take a benzodiazepine. Has anyone had the combination? Or good experiences with lamotrigine? I'm mostly on it to be more calm, in terms of anxiety and having a very short fuse. Thanks for any input.",General_disorder
"Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s wrong with me, Iâ€™ll have a few days of just being depressed, cranky about things that donâ€™t matter, low energy and then suddenly I get a day of just being normal, not crazy happy or energetic (manic) just normal able to do day to day tasks and go to work/gym and do the work normally.

"i have adhd, autism, depression, and anxiety. my life, at this point in time, is a living nightmare. my adhd is mismanaged (currently on meds that donâ€™t do shit), my depression and anxiety are untreated, i am not yet in any sort of treatment/therapy to learn how to manage my autism. i struggle through every day of my life and itâ€™s a wonder how iâ€™m even able to get out of my bed in the morning. 

if living through this has taught me anything, itâ€™s that most people dont understand mental illness/disorders and the toll they take on a person. i donâ€™t sleep. i over eat. i either feel all my emotions at once or not at all. my grades at school are falling. my room has mold and insects because i canâ€™t clean it. i canâ€™t focus on anything. i skip school because i canâ€™t stand the thought of leaving my room. i donâ€™t do anything i enjoy anymore. iâ€™ve been wearing the same clothes for two weeks straight. i donâ€™t brush my teeth and hide my breath behind a face mask. my physical health is suffering. most days i want to dieâ€¦ the list goes on. 

and no one understands. i try to explain it, and they just donâ€™t get it. when i try to tell people thatâ€™s thereâ€™s just some things i canâ€™t do, they say things like, â€œbut itâ€™s not that hard,â€ and â€œi donâ€™t get why itâ€™s so difficult for you.â€ they think that because i am so â€œhappyâ€ all the time and i have a â€œbubbly personalityâ€ i automatically have to have a stable mental health. but i donâ€™t. iâ€™m just really good at hiding it because iâ€™ve found out no one cares, or they just donâ€™t know enough to care. even my *therapist* thinks i donâ€™t need antidepressants because iâ€™m always joyous when i see her. i cant bring myself to be anything but what people need me to be unless iâ€™m alone.

"Hi!

This is my first post here. I have depression and anxiety and was first diagnosed back in January of 2016. Before being diagnosed I was doing research about my overwhelming feelings of anger at work (at this time I was working in retail) and talking to a friend who had depression in the past and what she thought of how I was feeling. My friend said she didn't think I was depressed since my main and only symptom was anger and only while at work. Google searches only mentioned bipolar disorder and I knew I didn't have that. It wasn't until I self-harmed for the first time to release my pent up anger from work that my friend suggested I may actually be depressed. I soon after went to my PCP, you referred me to a therapist, who diagnosed me with depression and anxiety.

So, to make a long explanation short, I wish there were more articles/information about anger being a possible sign of depression and not just bipolar disorder. What about you all? What do you wish there was more information for?",General_disorder
"All I can think are suicidal thoughts right now. I just feel this fucking awful sense of dread and anguish in the pit of my stomach. I canâ€™t do any of things I need to do and I have no support. I only feel this or numbness, nothing else. Nothing seems to help and I donâ€™t know what to do.

Iâ€™m supposed to be finding a way to move out of my toxic environment but I canâ€™t. I got into a fight with the social worker I got referred to, I try and find work I can do from home and as soon as I start the application process I just shut down. I canâ€™t function and when I even think about being productive my cognition shuts down and all I can think about is how something is seriously wrong with me and thereâ€™s no way out. I donâ€™t want to keep living like this and the only way I can think to get out of it is to die.

Nothing seems to help, none of the treatments Iâ€™ve done have done anything. I canâ€™t even remember how many meds Iâ€™ve tried and years of therapy have amounted to nothing at all. But even though I know none of the treatments help, all I can think to do is get myself institutionalised. One hour of therapy every month is not enough or something I guess. I just feel like I need something more constant, for someone to actually sit down and figure out how to genuinely help me, not just take me in for an hour and throw me back out before I feel like weâ€™ve gotten anywhere at all.

But I canâ€™t go. I canâ€™t handle the drama that would come with all of that and Iâ€™d almost certainly get kicked out of home if I went. I have nowhere else to stay, so itâ€™d leave me homeless once I was out. I just donâ€™t know what to do.",General_disorder

"This is going to be a long one, sorry in advance!

The list of mental health diagnosis goes on and onâ€¦ C-PTSD, anorexia, depression, anxiety etc.. but boy am I grateful in a strange way that all those struggles wound me up in therapy.

It was a long road of treatment centers and psychiatric hospital stays and continuous therapy in my youth going into my 20â€™s. My parents didnâ€™t know what to do with me besides send me away, and although I was resentful for a long time at both how they handled it and I was angry at my brain for being this way, I almost wouldnâ€™t of had it any other way.
Not only did I learn coping skills to deal with self destructive behaviors and how to keep myself alive, but I learned a larger sense of empathy, kindness, how to communicate effectively, setting boundaries, learning to love parts of myself I never thought I could, I just simply became such a better person than I ever could have imagined for myself. I didnâ€™t even consider these changes that I needed, but I am so grateful.
I used to be a resentful, jealous, and toxic person. 
The kind of person who would make rude comments online to feel better about myself, Iâ€™d be inconsiderate and passive aggressive when I didnâ€™t get my way, I was sort of manipulative at times and overall was not a good friend or even person.
But through therapy, meeting people from all walks of life and hearing their stories, and learning about myself and why I did the things I did, boy did I make such necessary and worthwhile changes.

I would never think of leaving a rude comment on social media, I love to spread positivity and kindness and always look to brighten someoneâ€™s day. I set boundaries, respect myself and others, I encourage achievement in people instead of being jealous of those doing what I used to perceive as â€œbetterâ€ than me. 

There is a burden of hate and resentment lifted from my shoulders. Yes, mental illness destroyed my life and probably played a big part in who I used to be, but growing and accepting myself opened a pathway to becoming someone Iâ€™m proud of. Iâ€™m now someone I consider to be so kind, caring, positive and just overall a good person. Iâ€™m so proud of who Iâ€™ve become and canâ€™t wait to see how much more Iâ€™ll grow. 
Therapy didnâ€™t just save my life but created a new one that Iâ€™m proud of. It works if you put in the work, I still struggle with mental illness and might always will, but I am able to cope in positive ways and constantly look to better myself. Iâ€™m so happy I went to therapy and put in the work to save myself. I am much better for it.",General_disorder
" So I've been diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, general anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, unipolar, since i was young. I was on 80 mg of Geodon, an antipsychotic, until I was 18 when I made progress in behavioral therapy bit after eventually being off all meds for a year, took a lot of work to get to that point, I started being on just SSRIs and it helps but I noticed that my depressive episodes can be pretty volatile. There have been multiple times I go from,being ok to having a lot of suicidal ideation and not being able to get out of,bed within a week and one time I went from sad but ok while in class, when my ex and I,we're having a nasty breakup, but within an hour was in that depressed state where I felt,nihilistic to my core and started typing up a suicide note while,on the way up to a parking garage top floor which was really sudden, keep in mind I made a vow against suicide and it kept me alive until adulthood. 

I also seem to have some mania occasionally? Spent 2 weeks getting a maximum of four to six, often two, hours of sleep a night in October and was super energetic and felt powerful and on top of the world, started talking to and planning on meeting and havjng sex with 4 people at the time ans was more bold and impulsive then when I didn't feel that way, kinda felt weird about it. Mt boss was joking,about drug testing me because I was literally acting like someone who smokes meth. Also spent a week a bit over three and a half years ago suddenly really manic and didn't enter REM cycle for a week and had withdrawal feelings when i crashed. Started feeling that way minorly this week when I only slept 8 hours over 3 days and just... Wanted to type up a hobby novel instead of sleeping but took olanzapine and a Xanax and slept 7 hours so I'm,back to normal. Was also super gabby and feeling,confident and a bit elated before.

 Is this normal? Or should I talk to my therapist and shrink? I never did because once I'm out of it, it no longer matters to me and I don't like talking about it in detail but this is raising questions and I'm confused since knowing,my brain chemistry and emotional patterns is important for me to know how to adapt to them. I'm also much more,calm and centered on antipsychotics, a very noticeable difference.

Continuing off of my uncle, if I get angry at a game, he fucking starts screaming at me with his stank breath self and fucking forces me to get off, and if I bring up his yelling at night (100x worse mind you) he goes ape shit and starts acting like he's not a failure. Starts acting as if he owns my house, but in reality, he gets 1. NO HOES (I'm an 8th grader and talk to way more girls than him) 2. CAN'T GET A JOB, BUT YELLS AT MY BROTHER FOR IT 3. IS FUCKING 30. THIR-TY AND LIVES WITH HIS SISTER. See, my dad works in another country (my parents aren't divorced) but the second my dad comes to visit, he doesn't dare yell at my siblings or I, doesn't dare disrespect us, always acts like he's a second father figure, but the second my dad goes back, he's a total fucking bitch. Onto my mom again, this bitch is literally fucking STUPID and expects me and my siblings to be legit demigods on the mental end. Gave my sister an eating disorder by calling her fat, and then calling her too skinny, insults anyone on their interests or literally anything. Like, she is legitimately stupid. I have never met a genuinely stupid person other than her, I always believe that nobody is truly stupid, but she is. She 100% is. She's such a hypocrite too. Sorry if this was long, don't wanna bother anyone.",General_disorder
"to start, i have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ocd (only mentioning because maybe they have something to do with why im struggling). 

i started high school this year and i thought that i would be doing better than i was in online school, im not. i can hardly be in school without having a panic attack, dissociating or getting physically sick. i get so stressed that i get fevers and sometimes vomit. i really hate being around so many people and being trapped here for the majority of my day (and week). i had this problem before quarantine as well but not to this degree. i just keep getting more and more stressed out and itâ€™s affecting my grades which is out of character because iâ€™ve always gotten good scores. 

i really feel quite hopeless and it feels like nobody cares, my mom just says its because i dont take my meds (i take zoloft, i react badly to it so iâ€™ve been weening off it) and my dad just says i need to get the â€œhigh school experienceâ€. 


i would greatly appreciate advice or coping mechanisms because i cant miss any more school this year and my dad doesnt want me to do online / home school because he thinks i wont get into a good college.",General_disorder
"I am not sure how well the title represents my situation but it sound good and catchy so ye.

I have a strong samskara about not being productive, not sticking with something, basically about not being a pitta (or kapha even) and I've been trying to fight, understand it, heal it, whatever for like 2 years already and I've been getting better at listening to my feelings and understanding when I should push myself, when I should let myself explore, at knowing when my thoughts are usefull or when they aren't, and yet I am hitting new lows on my mental health, I am getting scared that I am think that I don't want to live anymore more everyday. I am even starting to lose the energy to help myself. Everytime I think ""oh i done this wrong i could do this better"" or ""maybe trying to do exercise or meditate"" my mind just rejects those thoughts. Also the fact that I cannot cry or release my emotions in any way shape or form other than being angry and hitting shit does not help one fucking bit. I am aware of how much of an angry asshole I came as to the people around me but I can't fucking help being anything but pissed and angry. i literally cannot feel sad or hurt.

I am starting to think that the only thing that would get me out of this is some luck from the outside world, maybe my parents kick me out and having to sustain myself will keep me going, maybe taking some adhd medication wil magically make me functioning (I can barely play video games or watch anime, let alone try to get over the resistance that I feel everytime I want to do a creative pursuit), or maybe starting my transition and going on hormonal therapy will have some magical effects on my well being and give me some ""life energy"" to do something.

Taking care of my body, not eating so unhealthy (i just snack a lot), exercising, going to a therapist don't help at all and at this point I doubt I have it in me to do these long enough to see something out of them, I am completely unable to stick to anything for more than a week, and I mean anything. I am so fucking tired of helping myself and seeing nothing other than extremely minimal progress and improvment.

I kinda get that I have to let go of trying to be productive and sticking to shit and focus on having fun and stuff, but I just don't know what to do anymore. Being addicted to dopaminergic shit does not help and having 0 empathy from my family that I live with does not help too. I am basically stuck in my room (better than being next to them tbh). Going out also is not very fun, unless I have money I got fuck all to do in the outside world. Maybe finding some friends that go out would help but like I said before, no energy to do that.

Life is a gacha with garbage drop rates and I'm running out of cash to roll it.",General_disorder
"Hello im a guy im 26 yo i have a problem

When i decide to go to a therapisty mind tell me no u are okay 
I know im not going to do anything but its exausting 
What the fuck is wrong with my brain",General_disorder
"My uncle attempted suicide years ago. He was forcefully committed to a mental hospital for two weeks to keep from doing jailtime (because our country is a shithole for mental health issues). 

I saw something on Reddit a couple days ago that bothered me so much that I (only half jokingly) said I wanted to jump in front of a train. I admit I was this close to doing it. Someone (and whoever it was, thank you) apparently expressed concern over the comment and... suicide is a constant temptation for me, always has been.

What I'm artaid of is calling those and having them forcefully commit me to a psyche ward for two weeks, costing me my job and communication with my support network. Is that what happens when you call a suicide prevention hotline or am I being paranoid/have I seen too many movies?",General_disorder
"I mean, Iâ€™ve never truly been functional. But recently itâ€™s been a bit terrifying.

 I struggle to hold a conversation with anyone, and I always leave interactions feeling very awkward, and thinking I made the other person uncomfortable (which I probably did). This is definitely an insecurity thing, but also just something Iâ€™ve been actually observing. I just canâ€™t think of a response anymore. I canâ€™t think things through, or fast enough in a conversation. I always get jealous of others when I notice how fluently they can respond to others, and make the conversation comfortable. 

I also struggle a lot with taking care of myself, and knowing how to. I woke up feeling like I was coming down with a sickness, and I couldnâ€™t think of the first thing to do to make myself feel better. I canâ€™t seems to take care of myself well anyways. Iâ€™ll stay in bed till 2pm and still not want to cook, or know what to cook for myself. All Iâ€™ve have today is a nutrition drink and a hand full of fruit. It takes all of my energy to get out of bed.

Iâ€™ve been so exhausted, and my focus is worse than itâ€™s ever been. I know Iâ€™ve always struggled to focus and fully understand things, but recently Iâ€™ll get lucky if I can focus on sending a text message to someone. Iâ€™m so scattered. Iâ€™m losing friends, I canâ€™t even seem to keep any. Iâ€™m just scared and need to know what to do. I am going to therapy but it seems like nobody really seems to understand what I mean.",General_disorder
"The way I treat people, the way I think about things is off. I'm always looking for vulnerability, I see good people as idiots, all people, me included, I'm not exempt. We are all living in an ant farm being studied. I've felt this way ever since my trauma 5 going on 6 years ago. Sometimes I can't enjoy anything I am on alert. It breaks my heart how vulnerable people are and how trusting we are of things to make sense. Its even more heartbreaking to know the truth can absolutely destroy a person like me. When satan tells you you are a monster, you have to wonder. Of course thats what he wants, he wants me to feel like shit if nothing else. Btw I tell myself I have schizophrenia, I've been diagnosed as schizophrenic but deep down I still think it was all real like Rosemary's Baby ""This is no dream this is really happening"" Yeah",General_disorder
"I'm just upset about this and I can't quit thinking about what's going on. I hear things when I'm trying to sleep. Some have mentioned hypnagogic hallucinations, but I'm not getting relief. My dreams wake me up and some nights I can't sleep well. I feel really anxious at times when this happens. I've made a couple attempts to get help and didn't get diagnosed with anything. I'm not sure where to look for help next. I'm still working and keeping busy with stuff. It just feels like something isn't right though.",General_disorder
I used to not care at all but now I do nothing but care. Like getting left on read used to be no big deal but now it's fucking devastating. Does anyone else have this issue?,General_disorder
"Yesterday i thought im experiencing my last and most terrifying ocd coincidence when i anticipated what a person shared in his story. When i entered the app i saw that person shared a story and a thought came my mind. ""If this man's story is about x then y will happen"". I tried so hard not to look at what he shared but eventually i looked at. And i anticipated it true. He shared about x thing. And today after millions of coincidences which some of them were really hard to deal because they had so little chance to happen but when it comes to ocd they are actually happen, i experienced once again. When im reading,  a thought came to mind that if in the next page you see x number that means y will happen. y is an intrusive thought im scaring so much even here i can't talk about that. Then i looked at next page i was reading so quickly hoping will not see that number and suddenly i saw that x number the only number in that page. I was shocked. Im now so desperate dont know what to do. I forget how it was living with other ocd thoughts. Now if i someone give me chance i will accept experiencing all kind of ocd thoughts but not this one. because after all i can convince myself that these are ocd. But in this case i can't do this. It seems more than ocd. I can't deal anymore. Im open to all your support. Yeterday i thought it was last, someone from reddit gave me a good advice and i felt really good and powerful but today it happened again and im worse thatn ever. I even thinking maybe i looked that page before and my brain make me forget it because it wants to create obsession and maybe my brain make  these things seem like happen or i thought. Maybe these coincidences never happen but my brain shows them as they happen. Maybe i developed something else. Im dealing with ocd 10 or more years now im 21 and i experienced every kind of ocd thoughts (Sorry if i have grammatical mistakes im not native english and i know my grammar using verb tenses are bad)",General_disorder
"Good evening everyone,

Iâ€™m 22 years old and Iâ€™m suffering an addiction called Happy time(I donâ€™t wish to say my mistake) which is done in bathroom.

And I try to stop it, but this is way too strong! 

P.S. I hope some people can decode it without accusing me of trolling, because thatâ€™s not what I intended. I just donâ€™t want to reveal my sins to public. And I wish to basically examine my body and see whatâ€™s wrong with it.",General_disorder
