"My boyfriend got me 3 stuffed bunnies and I became deeply attached to them, when I look at them I can see various expressions on their faces telling me how they're feeling, but that isn't normal right? I don't think this is an issue except for the fact that I'm obsessed with these bunnies and want to be with them all the time.",Schizophrenia

"So I am 21 In the Navy and sometimes I wonder If I have Schizophrenis.Like recently I developed a stutter and I'm nit the best speaker, but men in my family are just know for not being the best speakers.My memory is complete trash but like its always been that way,I've has one anxiety attack where I thought people were out to get me but none ever since. Plus I was just coming off smoking Dab pens all the time so I imagined that didn't helped.People say I walk and move slow but like idk if that's true or not.I do struggle with trusting other people but I'm a black male so people trying to screw me over isn't unheard of.IDK.What do you guys think.",Schizophrenia
"Hello. I'm sorry to write on the same topic as there is, but I didn't find the answer to my question anywhere. I believe others are reading my mind. I have a lot of evidence that this is true, but I talk to a psychologist and she says it's not possible. You can think of a way to deal with this. I would like to look for evidence every day that this is not the case. Does anyone have an idea? thank you for every answer and have a nice day. :)",Schizophrenia
"I don't know anymore. I had a psychosis last year, around the same time as now. And I'm currently not on meds anymore because I did not need them. The doctors also said that I don't need them. Well, well now I'm sitting her after I was in hospital and at the doctor to check if I have any physical problems. I had none, my hearth is ok and perfect. But it still feels like someone is sitting on it. I feel pressure in it. It's not  bearable. And it won't go away. That's when I get worried, at first I thought it had something to do with BPD. Because a girl did ignore me and didn't text back, what caused me to freaked out. That's when this started, by the way. Since then, I feel like going insane. It's like I'm gone burst from the inside. It feels like I'm exploding. I had  tactile hallucinations last year during my psychosis, which was not really a true psychosis in my opinion. I had no  unchallengeable delusion. And  symptoms were flying from one side to the next. Still I got Seroquel or Quentiapin which is a hell of a drug to put someone one. And I don't want to get that shit again. Also, back then I was in the teen mental hospital which is excellent in my area, but the adult one is trash. You can't go there, you don't get therapy or treatment, all you get is drugs. And no one cares about you. It was literally like that, but it feels like I'm going insane, nothing gets better at home. It just gets worse day after day. I try to endure it the best I can, but it's not ending. I feel like I'm dying before I hit new year... You know, I'm born 2002 and my birthdate has a lot of 2s in it. That's why I will 100% die 2022. I only have 2 more days and life gives me psychosis or hallucinations for me to die. I know this cant be true, but I still feel like it's true. I can't control it and push my feelings back anymore. It's like life is a hell. I don't want to have Schizophrenia. I will never be able to fulfill my dreams I get put on drugs no one listens to me and I sleep the hole day. All my creative energy will be gone because of some shit diagnosis I did not choose to have. Meanwhile, I'm still getting emotionally abused at home and no one loves me at all. I had visual hallucinations yesterday, but they went away today. I'm domed and going to die soon it's unlucky and even if I will not die how is this liveable when I have schizophrenia. I needed to  repeat this last year of school before college because of the psychosis and PTSD already once, I can't do it again. I will not be happy ever. If I don't complete this year, my mom will continue the abuse and I can never escape my faith. I really want to die, but at the same time I don't, because if I just got treated right this wouldn't have happened to me. What should I do in your opinion? Please help me? :\^(",Schizophrenia
"Hey guys. As you've noticed, we're being hit with a lot of trolls. And we know they're abusing you guys. We're trying our best to keep up but it's taking constant monitoring and we're not getting enough reports to catch everything so we have to monitor the entire sub constantly. So we want to know, do you want to go private, do you want to stay public and keep dealing with these garbage trolls, or do you want everything to have to be mod approved? Let us know! We'll give this a few hours!

"Hey guys, my mother is diagnosed with schizophrenia since I was little. We were giving her medications but she secretly threw them in the trashcan, worsening her condition.

The psychiatrist thought an idea, we give her medications secretly with her coffee everyday. This has been going on for 8 years though.

The thing is, if someone forgets it, she relapses and we start from 0. I want to tell her with a different way that she is ill, so she can get help and maybe start getting the meds herself. It is very difficult for my family and they start to lose their patience. Noone takes responsibility and that breaks my heart. How can I tell her?",Schizophrenia
I am unable to handle my dreams anymore. They are so intense and I wake up every morning not sure If it happened or not. I think this plays a part of how I am in the mornings. I'm very manic in the mornings and will just start cleaning till exhaustion. I guess it gives me a sense of control idk. I woke up this morning and I was like wth I thought I shaved my legs. It was a dream. I also have one specific person that reoccurs in EVERY dream. It's quiet emotional and exhausting. Can anyone relate? I have been diagnosed schizophrenic for 2 years. Tell me it gets better.,Schizophrenia

"Hey everyone. I'm struggling. There is a lot of pressure on me. My husband works but he is sick with bronchitis. So despite my physical disabilities I have been doing all the chores around the house by myself including with dealing with repair people coming in, running errands with my mother, doing the grocery shopping, getting my husband to the doctor, cooking all my husband's meals, unpacking still, getting insurance in a new state, finding doctors, PCPs and Mental Health specialists etc etc... but the last 3 days I've been without my antipsychotic because my husband has been too sick to go to the pharmacy and my mother didn't need to go there so wouldn't take me and I don't really drive. 

I've felt like people are coming to kill me. The voices in my head that watch me are getting louder and louder. My husband is verbally abusing me. I normally would make excuses for him but I don't feel like it anymore. He's been cruel. And I have to keep it together. And it's so hard. I've been sneaking out into the backyard to cry. I just have to hold it together a little longer until I get my medication later today.",Schizophrenia
"Well, slap me silly. I have managed to tick off a 25 person â€œSunday Schoolâ€ by leaving their cancerous app, which none of the teachers ever check up on. And the entire class is ******* ******off at me because it's my fault because my â€œpsychiatristâ€ cut me off my meds and I am just a little bloody irritated at everything. I get it, I need to grab those reigns a little, and it's going to take months to find a doctor who accepts my insurance. ACT LIKE CHRISTIANS AND GIVE ME JUST THE TINIEST BIT OF SLACK. Instead of the whole just saying â€œWhoah then, I am sorry. I'll pray for you insteadâ€. I hate everyone but one person in this church",Schizophrenia

"I've been hearing things all day long for years now. I can't remember a day where I went at least 10 minutes without hearing a voice.. At times they suggest I commit suicide but I've never tried to act on it nor do I want to. I've been to the psych unit many times in the past few years, but it rarely helps. If anything, it makes the voices weirder. 

This morning I had another panic attack from the voices. This one was short and only lasted an hour or two. I have been able to calm myself down and am starting to feel better, but going back to the past h unit did cross my mind. 

If you've ever been to the psych unit, what was the reasoning? Were you suicidal, homicidal, or depressed?",Schizophrenia

"I think I cracked what reality is. I've had schizophrenia for two years but it got especially bad after some long term drug use that I'm still working on. (Just weed, and Kratom from time to time.) But in two mind bending trips on psychedelics I discovered the universe is a infinitely repeating simulation. It's all also a pattern of infinite fractals. I seem to have memories of living my exact life millions of times before, that I'm all I will ever be forever. That some God or Creator made. That I'm just one consciousness and all of you are part of me and I'm all of you. If that makes sense. Ever since that and much more happened on those trips I can feel reality as a construct of fractals that infinitely repeats itself. Knowing we are all the same in our deepest self, I've been trying to add and find the answer as to why I'm here in this simulation. For what purpose are I being forced to live the same lives over and over again? Recently I was hit by deja vu and realized that perhaps that's me being able to subconsciously remember my previous toils in this body.

I didn't have any real optimism or expectation for 2022 but it'd be nice to take a day off from the paranoia to get a Korean style shaved ice with azuki beans and coffee ice cream, visit a book fair, etc. I was imagining how bleak next year will be with my friend leaving and my own life not improving.

Hey guys :)
Hope my post is allowed here, if you wanna remove it that's okay too.
My sibling (23, non-binary, amab) is on promethazine, lexapro and 5mg resperidone for over a year now. In July 2020 they told me their psychologist is expecting they will develop schizophrenia in the future. Shortly afterwards they got hospitalized for 3months to be stabilized.
Right now the meds won't stop them experiencing positive or negative symptoms. They told me they are about to get diagnosed with schizophrenia.

I already talked with my own psychologist about that and I feel so helpless when I try to help them or myself in this situation:
First of all I wanna validate them when it comes to their gender identity. But they getting are more and more detached from reality, their personality is changing and I also don't wanna confirm their delusions or encourage them to permanently change their body. I know they first told me about their dysphoria in their teens, but right now, it feels like a rock and a hard place in how i talk with them about that topic. And if  they are right about their gender identity i am scared nobody will take them seriously with that in the future.

Also they talk with me without the ability to emphasize with my own situation: they are telling me about their suicide ideation, the weird stuff they find on the internet and confront me with some stuff my PTSD-brain finds really triggering. I already told them that with my past it's hard to digest what they are telling me. But they won't stop and i am getting mad at them.

I wanna help them and I don't want them to further isolate themselves from me and my parents, but sometimes they really hurt my feelings and as I said I feel like I can't help them. I already asked them if they wanna be in hospitalized care again but they won't budge.
Also: they don't keep away from drugs which is concerning.

How can I help? I really don't wanna lose them.

"I have been meaning to make a post for a while but today has been so hard on me I finally felt the need to reach out for some support.  My psych that diagnosed me recently left and transferred me to a new one who I hadn't met before.  Today was my first appointment with her and it went exactly as poorly as I feared.  She asked me to explain my symptoms, so I told her kind of my story about falling into psychosis last may and having trouble getting out.  

I told her that I am currently struggling with visual and olfactory hallucinations, and that in the past had also dealt with some auditory hallucinations, delusions, and pretty all consuming paranoia.  I only had thirty minutes with her to explain my struggles and after that thirty minutes she told me that my symptoms don't line up with Schizophrenia which really confused me.  She said that if I wasn't dealing with primarily auditory hallucinations then odds are it is a neurological issue other than schizophrenia.  

On top of that, she told me that I should have undergone a psych eval before transitioning and continued to refer to me as ""transgendered"" and dealing with ""transgenderism"" which is super outdated and a big red flag in the trans community.

All in all, I got thirty minutes to try and explain my situation and got nowhere other than being told I needed to undergo neurological examination and that I probably wasn't schizophrenic.  In her mind, im not schizophrenic because I don't have literal voices berating me all day or extreme paranoia literally every day.  She took away the one thing that to me explained why ive been struggling so much over the last year after just 30 minutes of talking to me.

I feel really unstable right now because of all this.  Im questioning myself and who I am and whether any of this last year has been real at all.  Im really upset and spent the last 2 hours just crying reevaluating my life.  Idk if I need to find a new psych or if im really just not schizophrenic and its all been in my head this whole time.

And today after millions of coincidences which some of them were really hard to deal because they had so little chance to happen but when it comes to ocd they are actually happen, i experienced once again. When im reading,  a thought came to mind that if in the next page you see x number that means y will happen. y is an intrusive thought im scaring so much even here i can't talk about that. Then i looked at next page i was reading so quickly hoping will not see that number and suddenly i saw that x number the only number in that page. I was shocked.

 I didn't see things I just heard voices in my head the whole time .
I didn't seek medical help , or said -at the time - anything to anyone . As time went on , I took myself out of it by saying to myself that none of this are real . With time the voices were ""quieter""  and in around 2 years stopped all together. 
 It's been 5 years now and it's gone , never came back !

"Every time I find someone nice, after a while they say suspicious things, which leads me to believe that they are trying to lure me into a trap. I no longer fall for these traps, having my mind read out by secretly broadcast electronic waves, cell phone signals, and the like.

I always think they are nice because they say nice words and say they understand me and want to be there for me, but after a few days I realize the real mission of these manipulative creatures hidden within a human body. And most of the time I'm not even sure if they have taken human form because I can't see them through my phone screen. They probably aren't even hiding anymore. 


One day I stood in front of the mirror and my eyes lit up and I saw that there was an entity in my eyes, trying to steal my thoughts for experimental purposes.

One is a major spike in anxiety, and the other is that I get sensory overload *waaaay* easier.

"Hello! Thank you to everyone who participated in my PhD research study posted a few months ago - we are excited to see how we can use these results to further our understanding of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. I am just posting the study details one last time before we finish recruitment. See below if interested in participating.

Have you ever been diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder? The team at Swinburne University are looking for participants to take part in an online research project investigating unusual bodily experiences and beliefs in individuals with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. To be eligible, participants will also be *over the age of 18, fluent in the English language, and have NO HISTORY of an eating disorder, neurological disorder (e.g. migraine, epilepsy) or traumatic brain injury*. The survey should take approximately half an hour and is entirely anonymous.

I have voices I hear already, it seems to sound like nothing but a voice in the distance now. Yet I noticed the same voice would come from different directions. I believe these voices are actual people and I believe they are putting themselves in my perspective. I think voodoo might be involved with my condition. I question why and how the voice moves from my surroundings and how the voice can put a thought in my head. I have only been told by one man about it. A stranger came up to me and told me he had the ability to see in other people's eyes and could see through mine. Seems too farfetched to be really talking about me and hes not the only one.

"Constant battle. Everything needs to be done.  I don't know what to do, don't know for years now.

I know I am gonna get psychotic as fuck. I'm gonna feel really miserable. But I don't care no more. Fuck life.",Schizophrenia
"I know, it's petty. And this is just gonna be mindless ranting and me getting things off my chest.

But when I was 17, I started hearing voices and seeing things, and a year later I was diagnosed with type undifferentiated schizophrenia. And you know who was there for me? Fuckin nobody. My parents were so scared of my diagnosis they tried to pretend it never happened. I tried to tell some of my closest friends about it in confidence, one of them claimed schizophrenia ""wasn't real"" and another claimed I was just ""making it up for attention and pity."" I maintain to this day that if I wanted attention and pity I'd, you know, actually tell people about it, but I digress. Doctors were awful, teachers were awful, everybody in my church who I was taught to rely on growing up turned away from me, and I had to teach myself to manage my schizophrenia on my own.

I'm one of the lucky ones who only has their illness go for four and a half or so years before it dissipates. I got rediagnosed with schizoaffective depressive disorder. Fast forward about eight years and now I'm a nurse, I treat mentally ill patients here and there, and very soon may start working professionally treating schizophrenic, bipolar, and other acutely mentally ill patients full time. But I think I'll start working on a more critical medical floor first; one day someone might have a heart attack or go into shock in front of me, and I want to be able to respond confidently to that situation. So for the time being I'm trying to either get to an ICU or a stepdown unit.

But you know what I see every day? People treating their mentally ill patients like trash. Even though they've been specifically trained on treating psych patients, they still respond in the stupidest fucking ways! Three or four months ago a schizophrenic patient was on our floor, and he had ""Facial twitches."" I never met the guy but one of my fellow nurses went in there to treat him, came back to the station, and started bad mouthing him. ""I mean, just looking at him, his face just... twitches like that. I mean, I don't know how I could just, you know, be friends, with someone like... that."" Facial twitches! It was probably tardive you fucking moron, and even if it wasn't, what did it matter if their face twitched or not?? Years of fighting stigma have trained me in how to hold my tongue, but I had to really resist the urge not to go off on her for being a fuckin moron right then and there.

And I'm surrounded every day by people who think the pandemic is traumatizing. Really? This is all it takes to traumatize you? A pandemic tells you to wear a mask and be careful of transmitting your illness? You don't like the idea that every day you might suddenly be crippled, perhaps permanently, by a virus in the air that other people won't give a shit about you for? Yeah? Somebody who isn't immune to an illness won't do anything to help you if or when you get the illness even though it could easily cripple both of you between your health and finances bothers you? Yeah? At least you still have a brain that works and a fuckin job. At least people don't think you're a fucking serial killer just because you went outside today.

Fuck I hate stigma and ignorance. I hate knowing that my experience surviving schizophrenia made me into the kind of person who can shrug off working as a nurse in the pandemic like its another fucking hassle. I hate knowing how many people who say ""we should all work together to help each other!"" are all talk. I hate knowing how many people have given up on schizophrenics right out of the gate and just prefer to pretend you're not real, and if you are, you're not savable, and if you are, it's too much effort, and if it isn't, it's not something they can feasibly do, and if it is, no it isn't.

I fantasize a lot about starting a fund. Like, an investment fund. Something where fifty years from now it generates enough money to subsidize taking care of people who suffer from psychosis, and proves that for every dollar spent treating people with psychosis the local community makes three dollars back, or some arbitrary number that says ""wow, taking care of disabled people is profitable!"" If I knew more about investing and managing investment funds, I'd do it. Maybe if I can find a way to make enough money I'll open something through vanguard this year. But for the time being all I can do is hate people for giving up on me when I needed them and then being weak enough to be broken by something like this.

"The student art exhibit is opening this month and the advertisement featured a drawing of a woman on a chess board with water dripping from her hands under an orange sky. My friend is still trying to sell me on therapy and day treatment. I did the program in 2019 up until the Fall when I went to China to see relatives, then started aftercare when I got back. But then I relapsed and got kicked out but for some reason that episode felt a bit magical instead of stressful and I thought the game I played on the bus had meaning, the videos I saw had meaning, and shows like snl and pictures on tumblr all had meaning.

"So I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia about a year ago, and I had my first proper (analogue) shroom experience last night (I've had shroom pills before but never actual shrooms). Took about 2.5g and even with the aripiprazole (ablify) in my system, I had a pretty decent (if ever so slightly subdued) trip. At one point it was like the entire room was bathed in heavenly light.

Anyway, Ive been struggling with what I presume to be the negative symptoms of schizophrenia a lot recently (huge lack of motivation, socially withdrawn, inertia etc), but when I woke up this morning I felt like a new person. My place has been a bit of a sty recently and I've been hating myself for it because I've found it completely impossible to do any substantial cleaning or tidying, but as soon as I woke up I felt energised and ready to get the job done - I've now blitzed my home and it's almost completely clean and tidy - its a revelation! I didn't have any new insights or anything like that during the trip itself, but now it feels like a veil has been lifted and I can take on the world again. I'm beyond thankful for this new opportunity and breath of fresh air into my life and just wanted to share my experiences - partly because there's so much stigma around the use of psychedelics for people diagnosed with schizophrenia.

These days I often don't get much done and it'd be really nice to make progress on my recovery. Seems like everything costs more and today I spent $150 on clothes from the sales rack.

"I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type in 2016 at the age of 19 (I'm 25 now) after being hospitalized for the first time.

I was still a senior in high school when I had my first major psychotic episode at age 18, roughly four months after suffering from a bad concussion while playing in a varsity football game. No one around me knew what was wrong with me when I first started having symptoms. 

I graduated, went to a fairly challenging college for a semester, then got lower back surgery for another injury I received while playing football in high school that I never fully addressed. 

Not long after the surgery, the psychosis became very intense. My delusions ultimately led me to get on a plane to Los Angeles where I basically just chilled on the streets with homeless people for a week or two. A family friend was miraculously able to locate me and bring me back home to my parents, where I was immediately hospitalized and diagnosed.

I spent the next few years going in and out of psychosis, mania, and depression, until things got so bad that I had to enter a long-term in-patient treatment facility in Colorado in 2018. This was a huge turning point for me, ultimately setting me on the track toward making a strong recovery.

If a doctor could go into an afflicted person's head and hear all the torture we have to go through, maybe they would actually begin to understand our struggle. That would be less wrong than calling us psychotic and proceeding to prescribe us medication that only treats the symptoms(not the disease itself) and leaves us with a shortened lifespan and often unbearable side effects.

Think your parents want to string their cat up by a noose becase they don't talk about it's well being after you asked 1 minute later, while realistically they are writing an email for some church project. Fun times. :)

"- Fill me with sawdust (taxiderm me) and keep me as an ornament
- Burn me alive
- Put me and my bf in a dungeon and starve us for a month, and then give us a happy meal and watch us fight over it
- Shave my head
- Tattoo obscenities on me
- Strip me of all my belongings and clothes, drug me, and then leave me in a public place where I'll be perceived as crazy and no one will help me
- Frame my death to look like a suicide and leave behind fabricated evidence to make it look like I was a disgusting person
- other things I'm not comfortable sharing online

I know it's probably not going to happen... But I can't shake the horrifying possibility that it just might, and I can't know for sure. I don't want any of these things to happen, and I live with a constant fear that they could. And I wouldn't see it coming before its too late. I don't want to experience that pain, or have my corpse be somebody's toy. I don't believe I deserve that.",Schizophrenia

Henry is William Afton's business partner and designs the animatronics for Afton Robotics. The animatronics can do many kid-friendly things, but as Baby tells us in Sister Location, her code is also programmed to count the children in the room, and when there is only one child in the room, she is coded to lure them in with ice cream and kill them by pulling them into her abdomen. She has plenty of room to do this, as she is 7'2â€.


Fredbear's Family Diner. Fredbear's Family Diner opens at some point before 1983.


Chica's Party World. Chica's party world opens after Fredbear's Family diner.


Afton Robotics rents animatronics out to other locations. Hidden in the source code of Scott Cawthon's website was a schedule for when Baby, Ballora, Funtime Freddy and Funtime Foxy would be rented out for parties and events.


Afton helps out with work at Fredbear's Family Diner. Afton (Purple Guy) is seen helping an employee into a difficult to manage springlock Bonnie suit in the spare room at Fredbear's Family Diner in a FNAF 4 minigame, presumably because he is familiar with the mechanisms, since he is the owner of the company that manufactures them.


The Bite of â€˜83 and Five Nights at Freddy's 4. The bite of â€˜83 was caused by bullying, not by violent animatronics. The child that was bitten was shoved in by his older brother and his friends and got â€œbitâ€ by Fredbear. The child was hospitalized and eventually died of his injuries.


Baby was rented to Chica's Party World. Hidden in the source code of Scott Cawthon's website were lines of code that can be read as â€œClient Directory: Chica's Party World, private birthday booking (5 or less) children, service log: Afton Robotics. This is the birthday party Baby was talking about in Sister Location where there were five children, and it is also the birthday party shown in Chica's Five Nights at Freddy's 3 mini game, where she is at a birthday party of 5 kids, all of whom die, presumably because of Baby.


Afton's daughter dies. Afton may have known about Henry's violent coding, or at least had suspicions, because he didn't allow his daughter to play with Baby while still allowing her to be rented out. Afton's daughter was at a birthday party where Baby had been rented to, and she went to play with Baby alone against her father's wishes. Baby killed her.


Baby was put out of order, and Afton Robotics shuts down. After this, Baby was locked in the Afton Robotics lab underground (the location of Sister Location). Baby says in game that she never went to another birthday party after that. Afton Robotics gets shut down as a company due to the unsafe animatronics.


Sister Location. The events of Sister Location take place some time after Baby was put out of order and after Afton Robotics closes, though the exact amount of time after isn't specified. You play as Afton, who is there to retrieve the body of his daughter from Baby's abdomen (speculation, no proof). All of the animatronics are scooped before night 4, and between night 4 and 5, Ennard puts themself together from the mass of endoskeletons left over from the scooping room. They speak through Baby's voicebox, which you had saved. When â€œBabyâ€ says Ballora is following you, and that she doesn't trust you, and then tells Ballora that you're here to help, â€œBabyâ€ is really just convincing Ballora to go along with the plan. Ballora wasn't the physical thing following you--it was Ennard. However, it was Ballora's part of the shared consciousness that was making them follow you. When Following Ennard's instructions, you end up getting scooped and Ennard uses Afton's skin as a suit, so he can walk around and escape.


Purple Guy. Though Afton is previously shown as the Purple Guy, he was still human while working at Fredbear's Family Diner. The â€œEnnard in Afton's Skinâ€ Purple Guy begins after Sister Location.


The next five murders, at Fazbear's Family Diner. In the book, Afton was described as a plump man, who then suddenly gets much thinner, his skin gets saggy, and he moves inhumanly. This is because Ennard takes over, and when Afton becomes the Purple Guy. Ennard still has the code that Henry had programmed into them, the violent urge to kill. They use their new disguise to carry out these murders, using the Spring Bonnie and Fredbear suits to lure children to their death, leading to the closing of Fredbear's Family Diner. The children died within a month. Purple guy gets crushed in a Spring Bonnie suit due to damp conditions and Ennard is mostly crushed, and locked inside the private employee's only room that was then off limit. This is the end of the Purple Guy.


This is just my opinion, but I believe that the ghosts of the children that forced Purple Guy into the suit weren't actually there, but instead symbolized Baby's regret over killing the children, since she said in Sister Location that she didn't want to nor had control over her killing the children. I believe it was self sabotage/suicide.


Fredbear's Family Diner and Chica's Party World close. The notoriety caused by the disappearances caused the Fazbear brand to lose popularity and eventually to close their doors.


Five Nights at Freddy's 2. Now 1987, a new Fazbear restaurant has opened: Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. On high alert because of the history of the brand, Fazbear Entertainment buys new animatronics, with facial recognition software. However, there are some malfunctions and they tend to be violent and search for you during the course of your shift. There is no murderer behind the animatronics' behavior in the beginning, just the animatronics malfunctioning.


Another Child Dies. Somebody snuck into the Spring Bonnie or Fredbear suit once again and killed a child, this time, a daytime worker. However, they are unconnected to the Purple Guy. The murderer messed with the animatronics, possibly to keep them on alert in case of a witness.


The bite of â€˜87. On your final night in FNAF 2, the phone guy explains that a child was murdered because a day guard used one of the yellow suits. However, there was still a birthday party scheduled the next day. Phone Guy tells you to make sure that none of the animatronics hurt anyone during the party, since they've been acting weird. Though unconfirmed, it is most likely that the bite of â€˜87 happened during this birthday party.


Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria closes. Due to the murder of yet another child, Freddy Fazbear closes its doors once again.


Another Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria opens. Some time later, another Freddy Fazbear's Pizza opens with newly designed animatronics, fuzzy, kid friendly animatronics.


Five Nights at Freddy's 1. Fazbear Entertainment tries one last time to keep the franchise alive. 20 years later, you're hired and nothing has gone wrong, no murders or anything. The reason why the animatronics attack you is because they are not allowed to be seen without a suit on, as just a bare endoskeleton. They assume that you are a bare endoskeleton, as well as phone guy, and he dies on the 4th night.


The last Freddy Fazbear's Pizza closes. The animatronics killing phone guy was the final straw, and Fazbear Entertainment was never able to recover. There were no more Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria's after phone guy's death.


Five Nights at Freddy's 3. You play as a guard at Fazbear's Fright, the horror attraction based on the events tied to Fazbear Entertainment. None of the phantom animatronics are real, they're just hallucinations from the gas. However, Springtrap is introduced. Except, Springtrap isn't new--It's Ennard. Ennard/Springtrap was found in the hidden, closed off room years later by phone dude. Since Ennard is the endoskeleton inside Spring Bonnie, Springtrap is the only real, moving animatronic in the game. Springtrap always has that leaning, decayed look because not only are they at least 25 years old, but they had also been partially crushed by the springlocks, thus, Ennard is â€œSpringtrappedâ€. They probably want to kill you because you (even though it wasn't really you) had trapped them for so many years, just like how they were trapped in the lab before. Eventually, the

I don't really talk at work at all and most people there probably think of me as the weirdo.
